A 1991 Delaware court in the ruling of Credit Lyonnais Bank v. Pathe Communications (hereafter “the court ruling”) expanded the scope of directors’ ﬁduciary duties to include creditors when a Delaware incorporated ﬁrm is in the “vicinity of insolvency.” The fact that the court ruling had no judgment on ﬁnancial reporting per se, combined with the natural event setting, which helps mitigate the issue of confounding factors, makes it possible to attribute any post-ruling change in conservatism by near insolvent Delaware companies to debtholders’ demand for conservatism.1 1.
