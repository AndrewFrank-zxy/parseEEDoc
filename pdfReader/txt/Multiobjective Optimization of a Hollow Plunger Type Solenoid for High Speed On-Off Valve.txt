Abstract—This paper presents the modeling, optimiza-
tion, and validation of a hollow plunger type solenoid for
high speed On/Off valve. In the preliminary design, an ac-
curate equivalent magnetic circuit model of the proposed
solenoid is carried out, and the magnetic circuit is arranged
in Kirchhoffs voltage law matrix form for the convenience
of computer calculation. An iterative method is applied to
obtain accurate permeability of the nonlinear magnetic ma-
terial. To optimize the design parameters, a multiobjective
optimization process is developed, and the multiobjective
particle swarm optimization method is used to obtain the
Pareto front of the desired objectives. An approved solution
in Pareto front is selected by analytic hierarchy process and
validated by the ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) method. A pro-
totype based on the ﬁnal optimized design is manufactured
and tested. The experiment results veriﬁed the validation
proposed design and optimization process.

Index Terms—Equivalent magnetic circuit (EMC), ﬁnite-
element analysis (FEA), high speed on/off valve (HSV), mul-
tiobjective optimization (MOO), solenoid.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE conventional electro-hydraulic servo system usually

uses servo valve as the control component. The servo
valve has advantages of high precision, low dead zone, and
small hysteresis, which bring high control performance, but the
disadvantages of servo valve include high cost, low efﬁciency,
and low reliability due to being sensitive to oil containments.
Therefore, digital hydraulic system that uses a combination of
high speed On/Off valves (HSV) to replace the servo valve is
a developing trend. The electro-hydraulic system controlled by
HSV has several beneﬁts over that with servo and proportional
valves: They are inexpensive, reliable, insensitive for contam-
ination, and possibly zero leakage [1]. HSV can be used in
hydraulic pulse width modulation control, and the ﬂow rate can

be continuously controlled through adjusting pulse frequency
and pulse width. Digital hydraulic system can improve the ef-
ﬁciency signiﬁcantly, which makes HSV become an research
hotspot hydraulic ﬁeld recently [2]–[5]. However, the HSV still
needs to improve to meet the requirements of digital hydraulic
servo system, such as quicker response, and smaller size.

The opening and closing time are the most important indi-
cators of HSV. In order to shorten opening time, some smart
materials, such as giant magnetostrictive material and piezo-
electric crystals with advantage of quick response, are used in
the HSV [6]–[9], but these materials still have some disadvan-
tages, which limited its widely application, such as high cost
and too small stroke. On the contrary, electromagnetic actua-
tor driving HSV is more feasible but the response is relatively
slow. Solenoid is a common used electromagnetic actuator in
hydraulic valve due to its simple structure and low cost. It has
been made a great progress in the past decades and various types
of solenoid have been investigated in [10]–[12]. Some solenoid
driving on/off valve can now meet the 5 ms opening and clos-
ing time requirement, but it still needs to be improved for new
applications, such as digital hydraulic system.

This study aims at developing a new solenoid driving HSV
and optimizing the performances of response time, size, and
thermal performance. Since these objectives are usually con-
ﬂicted with each other, therefore multiobjective optimization
(MOO) method in which all objectives are being considered si-
multaneously is required. For MOO problems, a common way
is using a set of weighting coefﬁcients to trade off different
objectives [13], [14], but more advanced methods often involve
artiﬁcial intelligence methods to obtain the Pareto front of the
objectives under design constraints [15]–[18].

The magnetic ﬁeld calculation is the foundation for opti-
mization of solenoid that can be obtained by methods of ﬁnite-
element analysis (FEA), analytical model calculation, etc. The
FEA method can directly calculate the ﬂux pattern with high
accuracy, and it is usually applied in the detailed design phase
for speciﬁcation purposes, such as motor geometry parameters
optimization [19]. However, the entire process of FEA is usually
computationally expensive [20], [21]. Moreover, changing the
design parameters in FEA, especially the structure parameters
in the preliminary design phase, often requires the model to be
reconstructed. On the other hand, an analytical approach can
allow the researcher to change parameters conveniently with
respect to the given requirements and constraints [22], [23].
The equivalent magnetic circuit (EMC) method that is a typical

analytical approach often serves as the ﬁrst step in the analysis
and design of electric machines [24]–[27]. The EMC model is
often incorporated with other methods, such as FEA for further
conﬁrmation of the calculation results [28]–[30].

The purpose of this study is to develop a HSV to meet the
requirements of digital hydraulic system. The main challenges
include quick response (opening and closing time should less
than 3 ms), small size and low working temperature. In order to
achieve these goals, a new structure solenoid is proposed. The
new design uses a hollow plunger type solenoid to replace con-
ventional solid one, which can reduce the magnetic resistance
and enhance the output force. For the proposed solenoid, there
are several parameters should be determined, which inﬂue-
nce the performance signiﬁcantly and usually conﬂict with each
other. In order to optimize these parameters, a high accuracy
EMC model, which considered the nonlinearly of iron material,
and arranged in the Kirchhoff voltage law (KVL) matrix format
for computational efﬁciency, is studied. The kinetic dynamic
model and thermodynamic model that can get the relation be-
tween design parameter and performance are also discussed.
Based on the these models, a MOO design process is carried out
which obtaining the Pareto front of desired objectives ﬁrst, and
then, an best solution in the Pareto front is selected by multi-
objective decision-making (MOD) method. Finally, a prototype
based on the optimized parameters is manufactured and tested.
The experimental results verify the effectiveness and validity of
the proposed design and optimization approach.

II. STRUCTURE OF PROPOSED SOLENOID

The structure of the proposed HSV is shown in Fig. 1(a)
and a typical conventional structure is shown in Fig. 1(b) for
comparison. It is a two position on/off valve. The returning
spring pushes the ball to seal oriﬁce when coil has no current.
The plunger generates force and move down when the coil is
powered and push away the ball to open the oriﬁce. The main
innovation of the proposed HSV is the solenoid using a hollowed
type plunger to replace the solid plunger. The hole in the middle
of the plunger is used to connect the chambers in two ends which
allows the oil to pass through when the plunger is moving. The
conventional solenoid usually let the oil through the peripheral

clearance, but it introduces unwanted air gap which weakens
the magnetic force. The proposed design can minimize this
unwanted peripheral air gap and enhance the magnetic force.
Meanwhile, the hollow design also reduces the mass of mover
which can short the response time further. The simulation results
in present study also indicates that the hollow holes has little
inﬂuence on the magnetic force.

III. ANALYTICAL MODELING BY EMC

A. Geometry Deﬁnitions and EMC Modeling

The simpliﬁed geometry diagram and parameter deﬁnitions
of proposed HSV is shown in Fig. 2(a). The EMC model of
proposed HSV is shown in Fig. 2(b). The symbol deﬁnitions in
Fig. 2(b) include magneto-motive force (MMF) Fi, equivalent
magnetic reluctance Ri, and magnetic ﬂux φi.

φi magnetic ﬂux in loop i.
R

equivalent magnetic reluctance in loop i of different parts
by symbol ∗ to distinguish them. Symbol p means plunger,
g means air gap, s means shell, and c means coil.

∗
i

In the EMC method, the accuracy of the results depends on the
correction of the built model. Generally, magnetic ﬂux prefers
to pass through the material with high magnetic permeability,
which is similar to the current in the conductor. Usually, only
the main magnetic loop is taken into account for simplicity, but
in fact, part of the magnetic ﬂux overﬂows from the main cir-
cuit and leaks through the winding. Therefore, a more accurate
model with considering the leakage ﬂux is developed in the
present study. The magnetic circuit is like a electrical network
that is made up of several voltage sources and resistances. The
circuit like this can be solved by KVL matrix method.
The MMF sources of winding current are given by

The vector of ﬂux (Φ) can be obtained by the following

Then the ﬂux density at each segment (Bi) can be obtained by

(24)

B. Nonlinear Material Consideration

The shell and plunger should be made by ferromagnetic mate-
rial with low magnetic retentivity, low hysteresis loss, and high
saturation magnetic ﬂux density. Therefore, soft iron (material

type DT4) is chosen in the present study. Its permeability μ
varies with the ﬂux density resulting the B is not a linear pro-
portion to H. So, the nonlinear material characteristic should be
taken into account to obtain high accuracy simulation result. The
relationship between permeability and magnetic ﬂux density of
iron is modeled by the following equation [28]:

μ = B/(k1ek2 B

(25)
where k1, k2, and k3 are constants for B − H curve of mate-
rial. Fig. 3 shows the curve of relative permeability versus ﬂux
density of soft iron. To avoid ﬂux saturation, the maximum ﬂux
density of the stator and plunger should not exceed the knee
point of the B − H curve.

An iterative method to update permeabilities is applied in the
calculation process. The permeabilities of each segment will be
initiated with a reasonable value and these values are used to
calculate the ﬂux density in the ﬁrst loop. Then, update the per-
meabilities according to the calculated ﬂux density by 25. After
that, return to the step of calculation of ﬂux densities with the
new permeabilities. This loop is iterated until the permeabilities
are converged. This process is shown in Fig. 3

A small ﬁnal error  is set to stop the iteration

(27)
As Fig. 3 shows, the derivative of B − H curve is monotonically
decreasing, and therefore, this process will eventually converge
to a deﬁnite point.

C. Validate EMC Model by FEA Method

Before the EMC model is applied for parameter optimization,
it should be validated by a more accurate simulation method,
such as FEA method. A typical design with parameters R4 =
9 mm, R3 = 7.5 mm, R2 = 4 mm, R1 = 2 mm, Rp = 0.75 mm,
L1 = 3, L2 = 3 mm, Lc = 20 mm, t1 = 0.6 mm, t2 = 0.5 mm,
and δ0 = 0.05 mm is simulated with FEA and EMC method,
respectively and the simulation results are compared. The ﬂux
density distribution by FEA and the curve of force verse dis-
placement are shown in Fig. 4. The curves of force verse dis-
placement by the FEA and EMC method indicate that the ac-
curacy of the proposed EMC model is entirely acceptable for
preliminary design phase. The ﬂux density distribution indicates
that the ﬂuxes are concentrated in the plunger close to the outer
surface, that means the hollow design doesn’t have that much
impact on the ﬂux density.

Fig. 5. Magnetic ﬂux density distribute on different sections in air gap
via 3-D FEM simulation. (a) Section A. (b) Section B. (c) Section C.

As Fig. 2(a) shows that the mover has holes to pass through
the hydraulic ﬂow. The holes will inﬂuence the electromagnetic
force since they will inﬂuence the air gap ﬂux density. This
effect is validated by 3-D FEA. The ﬂux density distribution on
different sections in the air gap is shown in Fig. 5. The results
indicate that the ﬂux density in the hole is smaller than the other
region. But, the distribution tends to be even when the section
gets close to the stator. The output force of solenoid Fm can be
expressed by the following equation:

Fm = sg B2

where sg is effective section area of air-gap, and Bg is magnetic
ﬂux density in air gap. In the present study, a conservative

IV. MULTIOBJECTIVES OPTIMIZATION

A. Optimization Parameters

In the present study,

the designed stroke of plunger is
xs = 0.2 mm. The design parameters that should be decided

WU et al.: MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION OF A HOLLOW PLUNGER TYPE SOLENOID FOR HSV

3119

Equation (28) indicates that the Fm is proportional to the
square of Bg while Bg is proportional to input current i.
Therefore, the ﬁrst segment of ton can be calculated by
i(ton1) = icp, where icp is the current to overcome the
spring preload. The time ton1 can be obtained by (29).

Fig. 6. Schematic diagram of opening and closing processes.

of the proposed solenoid are shown in Fig. 2(a). The prede-
ﬁned parameters include outer diameter R4 = 9 mm, diameter
Rp = 0.75 mm, length L2 = 5 mm, thickness of t1 = 0.5 mm
and t2 = 0.5 mm, clearance δ0 = 0.05 mm, initial air gap
δg = 0.3 mm, and diameter of oil through holes dh = 1 mm.
There are still six parameters that need to be optimized, which
include R1, R2, R3, L1, Lc, and dc. The stiffness Ks and
precompression xs0 of returning spring are also need to be
optimized to match with solenoid. For simpliﬁcation, the Ks =
11 N/mm is selected, and only the xc0 is optimized. Therefore,
there are total of seven parameters should be optimized.

B. Optimization Objectives

In the present study, the requirement of HSV include quick
response, long time durability, and small size. According to
these requirements, we deﬁne the optimization objectives in-
clude opening time ton, closing time toﬀ , the saturation temper-
ature Ts under rated force, and the length of solenoid Lm . All
those objectives will be discussed as follows.

1) Opening time ton.

The schematic diagram of opening and closing processes
are shown in Fig. 6. When the valve switches from open-
ing to closing, the two ends of coil are connected to
a voltage source. The current will increase and when
the magnetic force is bigger than the preload of spring,
the plunger starts to open until it reaches the maximum
displacement. When the valve switches from closing to
opening, the two end of coil are connected to a resistance.
The energy stored in the reluctance begins to dissipate.
The current decreases and when the magnetic force is
smaller than the returning spring force, the plunger starts
to close until it reaches the closing position.

The ton is deﬁned as the time during step input volt-
age and until the valve is fully opened. There are two
segments in the opening process. The ﬁrst segment is the
current increases after step input voltage Us until the out-
put force is bigger than the spring preload. It is a ﬁrst order
system and the current in time domain can be presented
as

i(t) = Us
Re

(1 − e

− 1

τ e o n t)

(29)

where time constant τeon = Le /Re, and Re = ρc Lc /sc
and Le1 = N 2/(Rtot1) are resistance and inductance
of winding, respectively. Rtot1 is total reluctance when
plunger is at opening position.

The second segment is during the plunger begins to
move at ton1 until the plunger reaches the end of stroke,
which can be denoted as ton2. This segment is much more
complicated than the ﬁrst segment. Even if neglect the
nonlinear of current to force, it should be a third-order
system. Since the plunger is limited in a very short stroke,
a simpliﬁed method which only considers it as an uni-
formly acceleration process is used in the present study,
which is calculated by

ton2 =

2xs/aon

(30)
where aon = (Fm 0 − Ksxc0)/m, Fm 0 is the magnetic
force at initial position, and m is the mass of spool. It is a
conservative assumption that suits for preliminary design
optimization.

(cid:12)

2) Closing time toﬀ .

− 1
τ eoff

The toﬀ is deﬁned as the time during cut of voltage and
switch to connect resistance until the valve is closed com-
pletely. The closing process is also can be divided into two
phase. The ﬁrst stage is current decrease before plunger
begin to move. The current in time domain can be pre-
sented as

t

i(t) = Ihold(t)e

(31)
where τeoﬀ = Leoff/Reoff. In the present study, in order to
close the HSV rapidly, a resistance of 1 kΩ is connected
between two end of coil to decrease the time constant.
The toﬀ1 can be calculated by i(toﬀ1) = icl, where icl
is the minimum current to hold the plunger at opening
position. Then, toﬀ1 can be calculated by (31).

The second phase is the time of begin to move until fully
open. Similar to the opening process, since the stroke
of spool is limited, the closing time is calculated by an
uniformly acceleration process, which is calculated by

(cid:12)

toﬀ2 =

2xs/aoﬀ

(32)

where aoﬀ = Ks(0.5xs + xc0)/m.

3) Saturation temperature Ts.
The HSV needs to keep opening for a long time under sustain
load, which is mostly decided by the thermal performance. As
current ﬂows through the winding, the winding generates heat
causing the temperature to rise, and the heat dissipates into the
environment through the surface of coil. When the solenoid con-
tinuously outputs rated force, the heat generation and dissipation
will reach a dynamic equilibrium at a constant temperature,
which can be deﬁned as saturation temperature Ts. The sustain
load is set as 10 N.

High saturation temperature will increase resistance, reduce
the electromagnetic force, and even make the HSV failure.
Therefore, it is important to verify that the magnitude of the
saturation temperature under rated force is low enough. Cal-
culate the required current for rated output force then using

following equation to get the Ts = Tenv + ΔT :

aΔT

2 + (b − C)ΔT = C(Tenv + 234.5)

(33)
where C is a constant which can be calculated by C =
I2R20/(Adis(234.5 + 20)), Tenv is temperature of environment,
Ts = Tenv + ΔT , R20 is the resistance at 20
C, a and b are dis-
sipation coefﬁcient, and Adis is dissipation area of coil, which
can be calculated by the following equation:

◦

+ π(2Rt + Cd)} + πCd mc lca

(34)
where the number of coil axial layers nc = [Lc /Cd], the num-
ber of radial layers of the coil mc = [(R3 − R2 − t1)/Cd], the
average length of windings lca = π(R3 + R2 + t1), and inner
diameter of coil Rt = R2 + t1.

4) The length of the solenoid Lm .
Small size is also very important for some applications, such
as for aerospace. The length of solenoid is mainly decided by
Lc, L1, and L2; therefore, the length index is deﬁned as Lm =
L1 + L2 + Lc.

The ﬁnal objective functions are expressed as follows:
Objs = [Obj1, Obj2, Obj3, Obj3] = [ton , toﬀ , Ts, Lm ] .

C. MOO Problem Description and Method

This is a MOO problem that needs to ﬁnd a solution that
weighs between objectives and gets the best performance. The
advanced way is using a MOO algorithm to obtain the Pareto
front and then select the best solution by the MOD method.
These design parameters are obtained according to the ﬂow
chart shown in Fig. 7. According to MOO and MOD method,
a wide design space will be achieved and the optimized design
will be selected from the wide design space.
let S ∈ Rn be an n-
dimensional search space, and fi(x) be k objective functions,
gj (x) be m inequality constraints, deﬁned over S. Let f be a
vector function deﬁned as

The problem can be deﬁned as:

f(x) = [f1(x), f2(x), . . . , fi(x)],

i = 1, . . . , k

gj (x) ≤ 0,

j = 1, . . . , m.

where

(36)
Then, it is interesting to ﬁnd a solution, x = (x1, . . . , xn ), which
minimizes f(x). The objective functions fi(x) may conﬂict
with each other, thereby, rendering it impossible to detect a
single global minimum at the same point in S. Usually, a solution
x, is said to be Pareto optimal, if and only if there is no other
solution, y, in S such that f(y) dominates f(x). The set of all
Pareto optimal solutions is called the Pareto front.

For MOO method, the multiobjective particle swarm opti-
mization (MOPSO) method [32] is adopted for its good global
searching capability and ease of application. The pseudo code
of MOPSO in the present study can be described as follows:

1) Initialize the population SPOP with the random design

parameters in the deﬁned range.

2) Evaluate each of the particles in SPOP, get the perfor-

mances by EMC model.

Fig. 7. Design ﬂowchart in present study.

Fig. 8. Analytic Hierarchy Process diagram.

3) Store the positions (design parameters) that get the non-

dominant performances into the repository SREP.

4) Restore the repository to make it well-distributed, keep

the size of repository under the deﬁned capacity.
5) Compute the update speed of each particle using
(t) − xi(t))

vi(t + 1) = wvi(t) + c1r1(pBEST

i

+ c2r2(Rh(t) − xi(t))

(37)

where pBEST
is its best position in searching history, Rh
is the selected leader from the repository, w is the inertia
coefﬁcient of velocity, c1 and c2 are local and social
coefﬁcients, respectively, and r1 and r2 are two random
numbers in range [0,1].

6) Compute the new position of the particles by adding the
(t + 1) =
speed produced from the previous step, SPOP
(t) + vi(t), and get new positions and return back
SPOP
to the Step 2 until maximum iteration cycle is reached.

For MOD method, the analytic hierarchy process principle

alternatives. The priority of the problem parts is deﬁned by
pairwise comparisons. It is easier and more accurate to express
one’s opinion on only two elements than simultaneously on all
of the elements. The decision maker does not need to provide a
numerical judgment, nevertheless, a relative verbal appreciation
is more familiar in our daily lives. The AHP method has been
applied in a limited angle motor design in [20], and the details
can be referred.

A three-level hierarchy framework for solenoid is shown in
Fig. 8. Level one presents the overall goal of decision mak-
ing which is selection of the best design based on the applica-
tion requirements. The second level is the objectives previously
mentioned. The third level identiﬁes the design solutions in the
Pareto front, which is obtained by MOO method.

D. Optimization Results
In order to facilitate the range setting, replace R3, R2, R1
using ts, tc, tm . The parameters range are listed below: ts ∈
[1.2, 2], tc ∈ [1.7, 3] mm, tm ∈ [2, 3.5] mm, L1 ∈ [2, 4] mm,
Lc ∈ [10, 25] mm, dc ∈ [0.2, 0.6] mm, and xc0 = [0.2, 0.6] mm.
Maximum optimization iteration of MOPSO is 100, the particle
count is set as 600 and the capacity of the repository are set
as 300. The obtained pareto front that includes 300 solutions is
shown in Fig. 9.

The subﬁgures in Fig. 9 are 2-D scatter plots of each two
objectives. Fig. 9(A) and (B) indicate that both ton and toﬀ
are conﬂicting with Ts that means improving durability of tem-
perature, such as improving cooling condition, is beneﬁt for
improving dynamic performance. Fig. 9(C) indicates that the
Lm is also conﬂict with Ts. Fig. 9(D) indicates ton and toﬀ
are in a positive relationship which means they can improve in
the same time. Fig. 9(E) and (F) present that the Lm is posi-
tive correlation with ton and toﬀ , and the possible reason could

be that the shorter mover has smaller mass. Each point with the
same color and same marker indicates the same solution.

There are 300 valid solutions in pareto front after MOO pro-
cess. It is still hard for designer to decide which solution should
be selected and some method should be applied to compare
these solution. The best solution is selected via AHP method in
the present study. Different priority vector of objectives will re-
sult in different best solutions. Two cases of priority vectors are
presented in Table II. The case 1 regard saturation temperature
is the same important as opening and closing time, and case 2
regard saturation temperature is less important than opening and
closing time. Fig. 10 shows the normalized value of AHP over
all weight percentages of all solutions in the pareto front of
these two cases. Best solution and objectives of each case are
highlighted in the ﬁgure. The radargraph of these two cases are
shown in Fig 11. It indicate the different of these two solutions
clearly.

Taking the manufacturing considerations and the AHP re-
sults into account, the ﬁnal rounded parameters of the selected

solution are ts = 1.7, tc = 2.8 mm, tm = 2.4 mm, L1 =
2.5 mm, Lc = 18 mm, dc = 0.25 mm, and xc0 = 0.45 mm.

V. PROTOTYPE AND EXPERIMENTS

Based on the ﬁnal optimization results, several prototypes
were manufactured. The resistance and inductance of solenoid
are 15 Ω and 40 mH, respectively. The static force performance
is tested with the input current density of 6 A/mm2 and the
output force and the displacement of the plunger are measured.
The curve of force versus displacement is shown in Fig. 12.
It can be seen that the experimental results are consistent with
the simulation results well. The minimum force at the initial
position is bigger than 10 N, which meets the requirements.

The displacement of the plunger cannot be obtained di-
rectly since the plunger is completely wrapped by the shell.
Therefore, a test rig which uses two HSVs and a pressure
transducer to check the dynamic performance is set up and
shown in Fig. 13. The HSV connecting to the low pressure
tank keeps open as an oriﬁce. Another HSV which is con-
nected to a high pressure source (9 MPa) is closed at the
initial state. The pressure transducer will detect the incre-

ment of the pressure, which is proportional to the opening
displacement of HSV. A current probe (ETA5301A) is used
to detect the dynamic of the winding current. A driver is de-
veloped to control the on/off valve which can connect a high
voltage source in the beginning to achieve high speed open and
switch to a low voltage source after the valve opened to reduce
heat and save energy.

The drive gives a 24 V step voltage to open the HSV and
changes to 12 V after 1ms. The dynamic of opening and closing
process are shown in Fig. 14. The results indicate that the cur-
rent is arising after the input voltage. When the current is over
0.6 A, the plunger begins to open the seal ball and the pressure
begins to increase. The pressure curve indicates that the valve
is fully opened in 2.4 ms. The current and pressure curves of
closing process indicate that the valve is fully closed in 2 ms.
The opening and closing time are both a little longer than the
optimization results and could be due to the winding turns being
less than the ideal value.

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper presented the design and the optimization of a hol-
low plunger type solenoid for HSV. The proposed solenoid has
oil through hole in the middle of the plunger to connect the two
ends of the plunger, which allows the oil in the two end cham-
bers to pass through when the plunger is moving. This design
decreases the circular air gap, enhances the magnetic force, and
reduces the mass of the mover. An accurate equivalent magnetic
circuit model is developed for solenoid optimization. The mag-
netic circuit is arranged in Kirchhoff voltage law matrix form for
computer calculation convenience. An iterative method is uti-
lized for obtain accurate permeability of the nonlinear magnetic
material. The theoretical model of opening and closing time
and saturation temperature are delivered for optimization. The
multiobjective particle swarm optimization method is utilized to
obtain the Pareto front of desired objectives. The optimum solu-
tion in Pareto front is selected by the analytic hierarchy process,
and prototypes are carried out based on the optimization re-
sults. The test results of static force characteristics and dynamic
response are proven to be consistent with the optimization re-
sults, which indicates the feasible of the proposed optimization
method.
