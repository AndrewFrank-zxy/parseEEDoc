ABSTRACT 
Debtholders’ demand has been widely discussed as a key determinant of conservatism but clear causal evidence is not yet established. Using a natural experiment setting, wherein a Delaware court ruled that the ﬁduciary duties of directors in near insolvent Delaware companies extend to creditors, we predict and ﬁnd that ﬁrms subject to the ruling signiﬁcantly increased their accounting conservatism. In addition, our results suggest that the increase in conservatism is more pronounced in near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms with stronger boards, conﬁrming that the court ruling takes effect through the channel of the board of directors. Our results are robust to using alternative

measures of conservatism and near insolvency status, and controlling for potential confounding factors and other stakeholders’ demand for conservatism.

1. Introduction 
Research on accounting conservatism posits that demand from lenders is the main reason why ﬁrms adopt conservative accounting policies (Watts [2003]). Supporting evidence for this conjecture is primarily based on documented associations between conservatism and various characteristics of debt contracting (e.g., Ahmed et al. [2002], Ball and Shivakumar [2005], Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008], Zhang [2008]), but most of them are not of a causal nature, raising the question of whether conservatism is indeed demanded by debtholders. Moreover, conservatism could also be excessive and thus inefﬁcient for ﬁrms and even detrimental to debtholders, which appears to conﬂict with the presumption that debtholders would always demand conservatism. For instance, too much conservatism may result in tighter debt covenants leading to premature transfer of decision rights to debtholders, which might unduly constrain a ﬁrm’s investment and ﬁnancing policies (Leuz [2001]). Also, excessive conservatism may allow managers to create hidden reserves, which may be reversed in the future at the discretion of shareholders (Leuz [1998]). To help resolve this ambiguity on debtholder preferences, we exploit an important legal event to identify a causal link between debtholders’ demand and accounting conservatism. A 1991 Delaware court in the ruling of Credit Lyonnais Bank v. Pathe Communications (hereafter “the court ruling”) expanded the scope of directors’ ﬁduciary duties to include creditors when a Delaware incorporated ﬁrm is in the “vicinity of insolvency.” The fact that the court ruling had no judgment on ﬁnancial reporting per se, combined with the natural event setting, which helps mitigate the issue of confounding factors, makes it possible to attribute any post-ruling change in conservatism by near insolvent Delaware companies to debtholders’ demand for conservatism.1 
1 The idea is that the court ruling provides an exogenous change in ﬁduciary duties, which in turn should affect ﬁrms’ supply of conservative accounting. This exogenous variation allows us to identify debtholders’ demand for conservatism. If the shift in supply leads to no change in conservatism, this suggests that the demand for conservatism is either fully inelastic (which is implausible) or absent, which is the null for our tests. 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
We use a difference-in-differences research design to capture the differential post-ruling changes in ﬁnancial reporting conservatism between ﬁrms near insolvency and away from insolvency and between ﬁrms incorporated in and outside the State of Delaware. We employ a ﬁrm-year speciﬁc composite score as our main measure of conservatism and supplement it with the asymmetric timeliness models of Basu [1997] and Ball and Shivakumar [2006]. Overall, we ﬁnd that, in the immediate period following the court ruling in 1991, ﬁnancial reporting conservatism signiﬁcantly increased for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms. The results indicate that, in response to their increased ﬁduciary obligations to creditors, directors of ﬁrms subject to the court ruling inﬂuence managers to adopt more conservative ﬁnancial reporting. 
We further examine the role of board characteristics on the effect of the court ruling since this legal event increased the ﬁduciary duties of individual directors, thereby establishing a ﬁrm’s board as the primary channel through which any response to the ruling should occur. Our ﬁnding of a more pronounced increase in conservatism for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms with stronger boards provides additional support to our argument that the observed changes in conservatism are driven by the court ruling. 
We conduct a number of additional analyses to test the robustness of our ﬁndings. Our results hold after controlling for confounding factors like real actions that ﬁrms can take as they become distressed, large negative write-offs, covenant violations and bankruptcies, and other stakeholders’ demand for conservatism. To account for the effect of ﬂuctuating ﬁrm performance, we rerun our main test on a performance-matched sample, a subsample that holds a ﬁrm’s near insolvency status constant, and a shortened sample period during which ﬁrms are less likely to change their near insolvency status. We also address possible selection biases on account of state of incorporation choice and the level of default risk. Our main results remain signiﬁcant and consistent across all supplemental tests. 
Our study makes a number of contributions. First, it establishes a clear causal link between debtholders’ demand and accounting conservatism. Prior studies have struggled to provide causal evidence on debtholders’ demand for conservatism due to potential confounding factors that may also contribute to a ﬁrm’s decision to adopt more accounting conservatism.2 We use an exogenous shock of a legal event, which expanded ﬁduciary duties of directors to include creditors, as a mechanism to examine whether debtholders indeed demand conservatism. This natural setting signiﬁcantly mitigates endogeneity concerns and makes it easier to attribute changes in conservatism around the event to debtholders’ demand. Second, our ﬁndings of a more pronounced increase in conservatism for ﬁrms with stronger

They document that foreign bank entry is associated with more timely loss recognition, and this change appears to be driven by a shift in ﬁrms’ incentives to supply additional information to lenders.

boards suggest that the effect of the court ruling on accounting conservatism comes through the channel of the board of directors. These results also add to our understanding of the role of directors in corporate ﬁnancial reporting. Last, consistent with Bushman and Piotroski [2006], our study provides additional support to the premise that judicial decisions and the associated litigation risk can have a signiﬁcant impact on a company’s ﬁnancial reporting decisions. 
This paper is subject to two limitations. First, any variable that purports to capture “vicinity of insolvency” will be noisy due to lack of a precise legal deﬁnition of the concept. We attempt to mitigate this possible measurement error by using multiple proxies for near insolvency status. Second, our sample may include ﬁrms that either have violated certain debt covenants or are severely distressed. In such situations, debtholders may have already been actively engaged in business decisions and pushing for more conservatism. To rule out the confounding effects of covenant violations, we control for debt covenant violations in a subsample of ﬁrms with available hand-collected data on covenant violations and ﬁnd robust results. In addition, in our main analyses, we also constrain the sample to near insolvent ﬁrms and ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly larger increase in conservatism for such ﬁrms that are incorporated in Delaware, thus ruling out ﬁnancial distress as an alternative explanation for the observed results. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We develop hypotheses in section 2 and present regression models in section 3. In sections 4 and 5, we discuss sample data and elaborate on the empirical results respectively. Section 6 presents sensitivity analyses and section 7 concludes. 
2. Motivation and Hypotheses 
2.1 EXOGENOUS SHOCK TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF DIRECTORS 
Delaware is a popular state of incorporation, as evidenced by the fact that more than 50% of publicly traded companies in the United States have opted to register in that state under the Delaware General Incorporation Law (corp.delaware.gov). As a result of choosing to incorporate in Delaware, businesses are subject to the jurisdiction of Delaware courts and are bound by their rulings and legal interpretations.3 Under common law, directors have ﬁduciary responsibilities to exercise due care, to demonstrate loyalty, and to act in good faith. It is commonly accepted that the ﬁduciary duties of directors are owed primarily to shareholders in ﬁnancially healthy ﬁrms, and a number of Delaware court rulings have supported this common law belief.4 
3 For example, see McDermott, Inc. v. Lewis, 531 A.2d 206, 215–17, Del. 1987 and reafﬁrmed 
again in Examen, Inc. v. Vantageport Venture Partners, 873 A.2d 318, 320, Del. Ch. 2005. 
4 For example, see Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc., 506 A.2d 173, Del. 1986; Katz v. Ak Industries, 508 A.2d 873, 880, Del. Ch. 1986. More recently, in the case of North 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
But the circumstances changed for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms as a result of a court ruling in one landmark case, Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, N.V. v. Pathe Communications Corp. (C.A. No. 12150, 1991 WL 277613). The dispute involved the actions of the CEO and executive committee of directors appointed at the behest of a major creditor of MGM Corporation, Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, as part of a corporate governance agreement. MGM’s controlling stockholder, Pathe Communications, sued the board for breach of ﬁduciary duties to shareholders and favoring creditors’ interests when the executive committee rejected Pathe’s request to sell certain assets. The court ruled that the board had acted in the interests of the company and observed, “Where a corporation is operating in the vicinity of insolvency, a board of directors is not merely the agent of the residual risk-bearers, but owes its duty to the corporate enterprise.” The judge further elaborated by way of an example in a separate annotation (footnote 55) that: 
The possibility of insolvency can do curious things to incentives, exposing creditors to risks of opportunistic behavior and creating complexities for directors . . . Such directors will recognize that in managing the business affairs of a solvent corporation in the vicinity of insolvency, circumstances may arise when the right (both the efﬁcient and the fair) course to follow for the corporation may diverge from the choice that the stockholders (or the creditors, or the employees, or any single group interested in the corporation) would make if given the opportunity to act. 
The footnote gained a fair amount of attention in the business press and among corporate law scholars.5 The consensus was that, as a result of the court ruling, the scope of ﬁduciary duties of directors of Delaware ﬁrms was expanded to include creditors when a ﬁrm approached insolvency (Varallo and Finkelstein [1992], Barondes [1998], Dionne [2007]).6 While the phrase “vicinity of insolvency” does not refer to an insolvency or bankruptcy status, there is no legal deﬁnition of the term.7 Nevertheless, the newly introduced ﬁrm status brought an additional dimension to 
American Catholic Educational Programming Foundation, Inc. v. Gheewalla, 930 A.2d 92, 99 (Del. 2007), the Delaware Supreme Court stated that “it is well established that the directors owe their ﬁduciary obligations to the corporation and its shareholders.” 
5 Becker and Stromberg [2012] ﬁnd that, in just three months after the court ruling (November 1991 to January 1992), the Credit Lyonnais case was covered 62 times in the mainstream press and newswires. It also received extensive attention in the legal community with over 150 law review citations through mid-2006 (Hu and Westbrook [2007]). 
6 Our reading of many subsequent court cases that referred to the Credit Lyonnais case suggests that the focus was almost always on creditors’ claims (e.g., see Geyer v. Ingersoll Publications, Delaware, 1992). Hence, even though the Credit Lyonnais case technically referred to all stakeholders (such as employees), the interpretation of the court ruling anchored on creditors. For example see, Ofﬁcial Committee of Unsecured Creditors v. Reliance Capital Group, Inc., 1994; Weaver v. Kellogg, 1997; Medlin v. Wells Fargo Bank, 2007. 
7 Judicial courts and legal scholars have not provided a precise deﬁnition of the phrase “vicinity of insolvency.” It is also uncertain as to when or how a ﬁrm enters the indeterminate

directors’ ﬁduciary obligations and increased their legal exposure. Therefore, directors in near insolvent ﬁrms would be more likely to consider debtholder interests after the court ruling became effective. 
2.2 THE COURT RULING AND ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM 
Conservative accounting constrains upward valuations of net assets and cumulative earnings, and consequently it helps mitigate wealth appropriations by lower order claimants (Watts [2003]). Basu [1997] and Ball and Shivakumar [2005] further suggest that external parties, such as debtholders, are likely to demand more timely disclosure of bad news to offset managers’ incentive to disclose good news early. Prior research has relied on this accounting principle to conjecture that conservatism is mainly driven by debtholders’ demand. While this conjecture is plausible, the extant empirical ﬁndings are in general not of a causal nature and thus make it difﬁcult to rule out the possibility that conservatism is driven by factors other than debtholders’ demand. In addition, potential negative effects of excessive conservatism cast further doubt on whether conservatism indeed beneﬁts debtholders.8 Therefore, it is empirically challenging to identify a setting where a causal link can be established between debtholder preferences and conservatism. 
A Delaware court in 1991 introduced a new “vicinity of insolvency” status wherein the ﬁduciary obligations of directors were expanded to include creditors. This natural event allows us to identify a clear causal link between debtholder preferences and conservatism. The court ruling gave creditors the ability to sue directors of near insolvent companies for breach of ﬁduciary obligations if actions taken by board members were viewed as either too risky or too shareholder friendly. Creditors, especially those lending to near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms, should favor conservative accounting as it induces timely recognition of losses while imposing a higher level of veriﬁability requirement for gains (Ryan [2006]).9 Consequently, given the expanded ﬁduciary duties to creditors after the court ruling, directors of near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms could inﬂuence management to adopt more accounting conservatism to meet the preference of debtholders and thus mitigate the increased litigation risk on account of directors’ new ﬁduciary duties to creditors. 
zone of insolvency. Throughout this paper, we use the term “near insolvent” or “near insolvency” to capture the underlying principle in the Credit Lyonnais court ruling. 
8 For instance, future reversals of current period accruals on account of conservatism may be used at the discretion of managers and shareholders to transfer wealth, such as distributing debtand liquidation-ﬁnanced dividends, particularly when the ﬁrm is struggling (Leuz [1998], Leuz [2001]). 
9 Early recognition of losses would constrain managers from engaging in overinvestments during acquisitions (Francis and Martin [2010]), encourage early abandonment of loss making projects (Srivastava, Tse, and Sunder [2010]), and prevent value expropriation during unfavorable economic periods (Nikolaev [2010]). 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
Under Delaware laws, directors are usually protected by the business judgment rule for actions taken in the best interests of the corporation, and companies are required to indemnify directors for expenses arising out of third party legal proceedings brought against the directors as long as they act in good faith; also, Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ (D&O) liability insurance provides additional protection. However, as ﬁrms approach insolvency, directors’ litigation concerns increase because struggling companies may not be able to provide indemniﬁcation, thus exposing directors to personal liability in the event of lawsuits. Moreover, if directors fail in their ﬁduciary duties, companies cannot indemnify directors and D&O insurance may not pay for damages either (Dickey et. al [2003]).10 
A recent study by Becker and Stromberg [2012] offers a possible contradicting view. The authors ﬁnd that the court ruling led to a reduction in risk-taking in near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms as well as their greater willingness to invest in projects that likely beneﬁt both shareholders and debtholders. In other words, the Becker and Stromberg [2012] study suggests that the increased ﬁduciary duties of directors in near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms signiﬁcantly mitigated shareholder–debtholder conﬂicts. Following this line of reasoning, with new claims arising from ﬁduciary duties of directors, creditors may no longer need to rely on ﬁnancial reporting conservatism to protect their interests and this could result in a lower demand for accounting conservatism from lenders. Consequently, it is possible that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms may exhibit no change (or even a reduction) in ﬁnancial reporting conservatism following the court ruling. 
However, based on the discussions, the reasons to expect higher conservatism after the Delaware court ruling are more persuasive and hence we propose the following hypothesis (stated in alternative form): 
H1: Near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms increase accounting conservatism after 
the 1991 Delaware court ruling. 
2.3 ROLE OF BOARD CHARACTERISTICS IN THE EFFECT OF COURT RULING ON ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM 
The court ruling directly impacts the ﬁduciary obligations of directors and therefore the board of directors serves as a channel through which the court ruling should take effect. Prior literature documents that board characteristics like the presence of outsiders or specialists strengthen board governance, because those directors have higher reputational concerns, are less likely to be controlled by shareholders, and are more effective in 
10 Judicial courts have held directors personally liable for providing misleading information and gross negligence (e.g., see Escott v. Barchris Constr. Corp. 283 F. Supp. 643, S.D.N.Y. 1968 and Smith v. Van Gorkom 488 A.2d 858, 3 EXC 112, Del. 1985). More recently, directors of Enron and Worldcom paid out of their pockets as part of the settlement (see In re Enron Corp., Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 391 F. Supp. 2d 541, S.D. Tex. 2005 and In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., 388 F. Supp. 2d 319, S.D. N.Y. 2005).

monitoring ﬁnancial reporting decisions (Ahmed and Duellman [2007], Krishnan and Visvanathan [2008], Cohen et al. [2014]).11 Therefore, if the observed changes in conservatism in near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms are due to the effects of the court ruling, we expect ﬁrms with stronger boards to be more likely to respond to the expanded ﬁduciary obligations implied by the court ruling and pay more attention to debtholder interests, which would result in a more pronounced change in conservatism among near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms with stronger boards. 
3. Research Design 
This section presents the discussion on variable measurement, empirical model speciﬁcations, and estimation methods. Detailed deﬁnitions of all key variables are given in the appendix. 
3.1 EFFECT OF THE COURT RULING ON ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM 
We follow a difference-in-differences approach across three dimensions, namely, state of incorporation, near insolvency status, and court ruling period to explore the differential post-ruling changes in conservatism across treatment and control groups. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst examine (i) the pre– post difference in conservatism for near insolvency ﬁrms in Delaware versus in other states and (ii) the pre–post difference in conservatism for Delaware near insolvent versus Delaware non-near insolvent ﬁrms; and we then (iii) combine the two approaches (both of which are imperfect due to nonrandomness of treatment/control group assignment) and perform a double difference-in-differences test, whereby we allow for cross-sectional variations in both a ﬁrm’s Delaware incorporation status and its near insolvency status. This empirical design is equivalent to teasing out the effect of the court ruling in two steps: isolating the effect of the ruling on conservatism attributable to state of incorporation and to near insolvency status, and comparing this effect in pre– and post–court-ruling periods. 
Our primary dependent variable is an estimate of ﬁrm-year level conservatism score similar to that of Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008] and Zhang [2008]. We focus on a composite measure since accounting conservatism is multifaceted (Ryan [2006]) and litigation risk induces both conditional and unconditional conservatism (Beaver and Ryan [2005], Qiang [2007]). A composite measure also helps avoid generalizability and estimation problems associated with any single measure of conservatism. 
To test our hypothesis, we estimate the following regression model using 
the ﬁrm-year–speciﬁc conservatism score: 
11 Ahmed and Duellman [2007] state that “Because stronger boards are likely to be more proﬁcient at efﬁcient contracting and understand the beneﬁts of conservatism they are likely to demand more conservative accounting” (p. 415).

where CRANK ALL is a composite conservatism measure equal to the average decile ranks of three conservatism proxies identiﬁed in prior studies: (i) C ACCR, that is, negative non-operating accruals, calculated as (−1) × the average of non-operating accruals scaled by total assets over a ﬁve-year window (with a minimum of two years) centered in the observation year t, (ii) C SKEW, which is relative skewness of earnings versus cash ﬂows, calculated as (−1) × skewness of earnings scaled by skewness of cash ﬂows over a 20-quarter window (with a minimum of ﬁve quarters) centered in the observation year t, 12,13 and (iii) C PZ for the unrecorded reserves on the balance sheet at the end of the observation year based on Penman and Zhang [2002].14 CRANK ALL incorporates different aspects of conservatism: conditional conservatism proxied by negative non-operating accruals and relative skewness measure, as well as adoption of unconditional accounting 
12 Conservatism results in persistently negative accruals, while the rate of accumulation of negative non-operating accruals indicates the degree of conservatism (Givoly and Hayn [2000]). Averaging over a number of periods mitigates the impact of any temporary large accruals on conservatism measurement, as accruals tend to reverse within two years (Richardson et al. [2005]). In addition, measuring over a ﬁve-year window centered in year t, that is [t – 2, t + 2], ensures that the transitory component in year t’s non-operating accruals is reversed by year t + 2, while the noise with reversal of temporary large accruals from t – 2 through t – 1 can also be removed. Last, choosing the measurement window centered in year t (as in Ahmed and Duellman [2007], Krishnan and Visvanathan [2008]) instead of up to year t (as in Zhang [2008], Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008]), facilitates the appropriate lead-lag model speciﬁcation since we measure the determinants of conservatism in year t – 1. 13 In additional analyses, we measure C ACCR and C SKEW over either a ﬁve-year window centered in year t + 1 or a three-year window centered in year t, and still ﬁnd a positive effect of the court ruling on conservatism when conservatism is measured as negative nonoperating accruals, relative earnings skewness, and the composite conservatism measure (see online appendix table A1). 
14 Speciﬁcally, C PZ is calculated as the sum of (i) LIFO reserve as reported in the observation year t’s ﬁnancial statement, (ii) R&D reserve that would have been on the balance sheet at the end of the observation year t if R&D expenditures had been capitalized and amortized using the industry coefﬁcients estimated by Lev and Sougiannis [1996], and (iii) advertising reserves that would have been on the balance sheet at the end of the observation year t if advertising expenditures had been capitalized and amortized using a sum-of-the-year’s digits method over two years, deﬂated by net operating assets. We include PZ score to capture the variations in unconditional conservatism, as ﬁrms have discretion to change their inventory accounting method, to capitalize direct response advertising, and to capitalize costs of internally developed software that reached a state of technological feasibility, that is, R&D expenditure. We also test the robustness of our results by dropping PZ score from the composite conservatism measure and the inferences remain the same (see online appendix table A2).

conservatism through unrecorded reserves, which result in lower reported net income (PZ score).15 
The court ruling applies only to Delaware-incorporated ﬁrms near insolvency. Since there is no legal deﬁnition of the term “near insolvency,” we follow Becker and Stromberg [2012] in using Estimated Default Frequency (EDF) based on the probability transformation of “distance-to-default” developed by Merton [1974] to develop our measure of near insolvency.16 We construct the near insolvency indicator HEDF93 based on the 1993 EDF score, because 1993 is the ﬁrst post-transition full year in our analysis when the ruling became effective.17 HEDF93 is a dichotomous variable equal to one if a ﬁrm’s 1993 EDF score is in the top quartile of its distribution, and zero otherwise. Consistent with Becker and Stromberg [2012], HEDF93 only varies cross-sectionally in our models, as we need to ﬁx the status of near insolvency at the 1993 level in order to conduct the differencein-differences analyses.18 
Other variables in the model are deﬁned as follows. DEL is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the ﬁrm is incorporated in the State of Delaware, and zero otherwise. POST is a dichotomous variable equal to one for the post-ruling period deﬁned as 1993–1996 and zero for the pre-ruling period of 1988–1991.19 We include natural log of market value of equity (LNMVE) in our regression model to control for the effect of ﬁrm size on ﬁnancial reporting conservatism as the literature provides arguments for either a positive or negative association of ﬁrm size with conservatism.20 The control for ﬁrms’ leverage (ratio of total liabilities to total assets, LEV) captures creditors’ overall demand for conservatism (Ahmed et al. [2002]). In addition, we include book-to-market ratio (BTM) and asset growth (GROWTH) to 
15 We do not include C-score in our composite measure because C-score would capture changes in ﬁrm characteristics following the regime change, which need not have anything to do with conservatism in our setting. We thank the anonymous referee for pointing this out. 
16 We thank Tyler Shumway for sharing the SAS program to calculate EDF scores (www
personal.umich.edu/ßshumway/papers.dir/nuiter99 print.sas). 
17 The judge passed his ruling on November 6, 1991, and the case was ﬁnally decided on 
December 30, 1991. 
18 A fundamental assumption with the deﬁnition of HEDF93 is that the sample ﬁrms’ status of near insolvency does not change throughout the sample period. In supplemental analyses, we test the validity of this assumption by constraining our sample to ﬁrms that are near insolvent throughout the whole sample period and by shortening the preand post-ruling periods so that the near insolvency status is less likely to change (online appendix A15). 
19 Our pre-ruling period begins in 1988 because 1988 is the ﬁrst year in which operating cash ﬂows data become widely available in Compustat, and this variable is required to estimate two-dimensional conservatism measures, that is, negative non-operating accruals (C ACCR) and relative earnings skewness (C SKEW). We exclude year 1992 from our analysis because the ruling was passed at the end of 1991, and it is unlikely to be fully implemented during the transition year of 1992. 
20 Political costs hypothesis suggests a positive association, while income aggregation and information asymmetries hypothesis suggests a negative association between conservatism and ﬁrm size (LaFond and Watts [2008]). 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
control for the effects of ﬁrms’ growth prospects on their ﬁnancial reporting conservatism. High growth ﬁrms could prefer less conservative accounting because of greater pressures to present better accounting and stock performance (Ahmed and Duellman [2013]). To capture the effect of a greater demand for conservatism from ﬁrms in more litigious industries, we include a dichotomous variable for high-litigation industries, LITIG (Watts [2003], Khan and Watts [2009]). Finally, we also control for institutional ownership INSTOWN since prior research shows that institutional investors demand a higher level of accounting conservatism to ensure more efﬁcient investment allocation (Ahmed and Duellman [2007], Ramalingagowda and Yu [2012]). Consistent with prior literature, we measure all control variables at the beginning of the year with all continuous variables winsorized at 1% and 99%. We cluster standard errors in all models by ﬁrm and year.21 The primary focus of our analysis is β7, which is predicted to be positive, that is, we expect near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms to experience an increase in conservatism in the post-ruling period. 
3.2 ROLE OF BOARD CHARACTERISTICS IN THE EFFECT OF COURT RULING ON ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM 
To corroborate our ﬁndings in section 3.1, we explore board characteristics identiﬁed in prior literature to examine the role of board characteristics in the adoption of accounting conservatism. We create a composite measure of board governance, BSCORE, that is equal to the sum of the four dichotomous variables, namely: board size (D SMBRD), board independence (D MAJIND), board accounting expertise (D ACCEXP), and board industry expertise (D INDEXP). D SMBRD is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the total count of directors on the board is smaller than the sample median of eight members and zero otherwise. Similar to Ajinkya, Bhojraj, and Sengupta [2005], we measure board independence (D MAJIND) as a dichotomous variable equal to one if more than 50% of directors on the board are independent, and zero otherwise. D ACCEXP is measured as a dichotomous variable equal to one if at least one independent director on the board has accounting expertise, and zero otherwise.22 We deﬁne D INDEXP as a dichotomous variable equal to one if at least one independent director on the board has industry expertise, deﬁned as any prior experience in another ﬁrm that operates in the same two-digit primary SIC industry, and zero otherwise (Faleye, Hoitash, and Hoitash [2012]). To examine how the board of directors could serve as a channel for the court ruling, we estimate 
21 In an additional analysis, we also cluster standard errors of the main model by ﬁrm and ﬁnd the effect of ruling on the composite conservatism measure, CRANK ALL, is still positive and signiﬁcant (the coefﬁcient on POST×DEL×HEDF93 = 0.489, t-stat = 3.10). We present this result in online appendix table A3. 
22 Following Defond, Hann, and Hu [2005], we deﬁne accounting ﬁnancial experts as directors with experience as a certiﬁed public accountant, auditor, principal/chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer, controller, or principal/chief accounting ofﬁcer.

3.3 MEASURING ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM USING ASYMMETRIC TIMELINESS MODELS 
3.3.1. Asymmetric Timeliness of Earnings. In addition to our primary yearspeciﬁc conservatism measure, we estimate cross-sectional conditional conservatism (asymmetric timeliness) models modiﬁed to capture the effects of the court ruling on near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms. First, we estimate the following regression based on Basu [1997] asymmetric timeliness of earnings model23: X /P = β0 + β1RET + β2D + β3D × RET + β4POST + β5POST × RET 
+ β6 POST × D + β7 POST × D × RET + [β8HEDF93 + β9 HEDF93 × RET + β10HEDF93 × D + β11HEDF93 × D × RET + β12HEDF93 × POST + β13HEDF93 × POST × RET + β14HEDF93 × POST × D + β15HEDF93 × POST × D × RET ] + [β16 DEL + β17 DEL × RET + β18DEL × D + β19 DEL × D × RET + β20DEL × POST + β21DEL × POST × RET + β22DEL × POST × D + β23DEL × POST × D × RET ] (3) + [β24HEDF93 × DEL + β25HEDF93 × DEL × RET + β26 HEDF93 × DEL × D + β27 HEDF93 × DEL × D × RET + β28HEDF93 × DEL × POST + β29 HEDF93 × DEL × POST × RET + β30HEDF93 × DEL × POST × D + β31HEDF93 × DEL × POST × D × RET ] + Control Variables + Control Variables × R E T + Control Variables × D + Control Variables × D ×RET + Industry Dummies + Year Dummies + e , 
where X/P is a ﬁrm’s earnings per share deﬂated by the beginning of the year price, RET is a ﬁrm’s buy-and-hold annual stock return, and D is a dichotomous variable equal to one if RET is negative and zero otherwise. In addition to the six control variables used in model (1), that is, size 
23 One caveat with using asymmetric timeliness of earnings as a conservatism measure in our setting is that its construction uses market returns, while market prices possibly respond to the court ruling and may embed an expectation of what the ﬁrm will do in response to the ruling. This is the primary reason why we rely on several conservatism proxies in our study. 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
(LNMVE), leverage (LEV), book-to-market (BTM), growth (GROWTH), litigation risk (LITIG), and institutional ownership (INSTOWN), we also control for stock return volatility (STDRET) and natural log of stock price (LNPRC) because these variables have been shown to mitigate biases in the Basu [1997] model (Ball, Kothari, and Nikolaev [2013]). We measure all control variables at the beginning of the year. To control for possible confounding effects of these control variables on the cross-sectional variation in asymmetric timeliness, we include a full set of interaction terms of these control variables with D, RET, and our primary variable of interest D×RET.24 Our hypothesis predicts that β31 is positive and signiﬁcant, that is, near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms experience a large increase in asymmetric timeliness of earnings in the post-ruling period. 
3.3.2. Asymmetric Timeliness of Accruals. Following Ball and Shivakumar [2006], we also run an accrual-based conditional conservatism model as follows: ACCR = β0 + β1CF + β2DCF + β3DCF × CF + β4POST + β5POST × CF 
+ β6 POST × DCF + β7 POST × DCF × CF + [β8HEDF93 + β9 HEDF93 × CF + β10HEDF93 × DCF + β11HEDF93 × DCF × CF + β 12 HEDF93 × POST + β13HEDF93 × POST × CF + β14HEDF93 × POST × DCF + β15HEDF93 × POST × DCF × CF ] + [β16 DEL + β17 DEL × CF + β18DEL × DCF + β19 DEL × DCF × CF + β20DEL × POST + β21DEL × POST × CF + β22DEL × POST × DCF + β23DEL × POST × DCF × CF ] + [β24HEDF93 × DEL + β25HEDF93 × DEL × CF + β26HEDF93 × DEL × DCF + β27 HEDF93 × DEl × DCF × CF + β28HEDF93 × DEL × POST + β29 HEDF93 × DEL × POST × CF + β30HEDF93 × DEL × POST × DCF + β31HEDF93 × DEL × POST × DCF × CF ] + Control Variables + Control Variables × CF + Control Variables × DCF +Control Variables × DCF × CF + Industry Dummies + Year Dummies + e ,

where ACCR is a ﬁrm’s accruals (deﬁned as the difference between income from continuing operations and operating cash ﬂows) scaled by beginning of the year total assets, CF is a ﬁrm’s operating cash ﬂows scaled by beginning of the year total assets, and DCF is a dichotomous variable equal to one if CF is negative and zero otherwise. We include the same set of control variables as in model (1). Similar to model (3), to control for possible confounding effects of control variables on asymmetric timeliness of accruals, we include a full set of interaction terms of control variables with DCF, CF, and DCF×CF. 
24 To alleviate multicollinearity concerns due to a very large number of interaction terms, 
we demean all continuous variables in this model.

4. Sample Selection and Descriptive Statistics 
Panel A of table 1 describes construction of the sample used to test our main hypothesis. We begin with 86,672 ﬁrm-year observations from Compustat for 1988–1991 and 1993–1996. We ﬁrst drop 11,092 ﬁrm-years with missing state of incorporation data in Compustat and another 17,148 observations of ﬁnancial ﬁrms. We lose an additional 8,131 observations because of missing data needed to estimate the three conservatism measures, that is, C ACCR, C SKEW, and C PZ. We also drop 22,389 observations with missing data to compute 1993 EDF scores to measure near insolvency, and another 5,256 observations with negative market value equity or missing ﬁnancial statement and institutional ownership data. Finally, after requiring each ﬁrm in our sample to have at least one observation in each of the preand post-ruling periods, our ﬁnal sample has 18,827 ﬁrm-year observations (2,705 unique ﬁrms). Panel B of table 1 shows annual distribution of sample ﬁrms partitioned by DEL and HEDF93. 
We present the descriptive statistics of our sample in table 2. Conservatism rank in our main sample has a mean of 4.500 and a median of 4.333

on a 0–9 scale. Mean (median) C ACCR (i.e., negative non-operating accruals) is 0.017 (0.009) and mean (median) C SKEW (i.e., the ratio of earnings skewness to cash ﬂows skewness) is 0.820 (0.191), generally consistent with prior literature (e.g., Givoly and Hayn [2000], Ahmed and Duellman [2007], Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008], and Zhang [2008]). Similar to Penman and Zhang [2002], our sample has a mean (median) C PZ of 0.356 (0.100). About half of our sample is in the post-ruling period (mean of POST, 0.516). Consistent with prior ﬁndings (e.g., Daines [2001]), approximately 51% of ﬁrm-years in our sample correspond to ﬁrms incorporated in Delaware (mean of DEL, 0.507). Mean (median) EDF93 of 5.4% (0.002%) implies that the 1993 EDF distribution is right skewed, that is, our sample includes some ﬁrms that were highly distressed in 1993.25 The mean value of HEDF93 (0.186) indicates that about 19% of sample ﬁrm-year observations have a 1993 EDF score in the top quartile of its distribution. Mean (median) MVE of our sample is $852.401 (94.500) million, suggesting that our sample is somewhat skewed toward larger ﬁrms. Descriptive statistics on other control variables are in general consistent with expectations.26

the income aggregation and information asymmetries hypothesis by LaFond and Watts [2008] and consistent with prior literature (Ramalingegowda and Yu [2012], LaFond and Roychowhury [2008]); and is positively correlated with litigation risk and institutional ownership (e.g., Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008] and Ramalingegowda and Yu [2012]). The negative correlation between our conservatism measure and leverage appears to contradict prior studies (e.g., Khan and Watts [2009]), but multivariate analyses conﬁrm the documented positive association of leverage with conservatism. The negative association of book-to-market ratio with conservatism is consistent with the expected positive association between conservatism and market-to-book (e.g., Roychowdhury and Watts [2007]). HEDF93 is positively correlated with CRANK ALL, that is, ﬁrms approaching near insolvency in 1993 are on average more conservative during the sample period. Predictably, ﬁrm size (natural log of market value of equity) 
board in our sample has about eight directors (similar to Anderson, Mansi, and Reeb [2004]). The average PCT INDDIR is 0.675, suggesting that on average about 68% of the directors on the board are independent, similar to data reported in Ahmed and Duellman [2007]. The mean D MAJIND is 0.873, implying that about 87% of ﬁrms in our sample have majority independent boards. In addition, consistent with the perceived lack of accounting expertise on boards prior to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 and with the ﬁndings in Krishnan and Visvanathan [2008], we ﬁnd that only 22.1% of our sample observations have at least one director with accounting expertise. Finally, we ﬁnd at least one director with industry expertise on 28.2% of ﬁrm-years in our sample. 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
and default risk in 1993 are also negatively correlated, as near insolvent ﬁrms are more likely to be undercapitalized. Other signiﬁcant correlations are generally in line with expectations. 
5. Empirical Results 
5.1 MAIN RESULTS ON THE COURT RULING AND ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM 
Panel A of table 4 presents three types of difference-in-differences tests. First, we constrain the sample to Delaware ﬁrms (i.e., DEL = 1) and compare the increase in conservatism for ﬁrms near insolvency and those that are not. We ﬁnd that, after the court ruling, near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms increase conservatism signiﬁcantly more than not near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms (column (i): coefﬁcient on POST×HEDF93 = 0.393, t-stat = 4.48). Second, we focus on a subsample of near insolvent ﬁrms (i.e., HEDF93 = 1) and ﬁnd that the change in conservatism around the court ruling is significantly larger for near insolvent ﬁrms incorporated in Delaware than those incorporated elsewhere (column (ii): coefﬁcient on POST×DEL = 0.497, t-stat = 4.26). Last, we estimate the full model (1) on the entire sample and present the result in column (iii) in panel A. As predicted by our hypothesis, we ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient on POST×DEL×HEDF93 is positive and signiﬁcant (β7 = 0.489, t-stat = 3.82), which suggests that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms exhibit a larger increase in conservatism around the court ruling. Focusing on the full speciﬁcation in column (iii), we ﬁnd that CRANK ALL is positively associated with litigation risk and institutional ownership, and negatively with ﬁrm size, book-to-market ratio, and asset growth, consistent with prior literature (e.g., Roychowdhury and Watts [2007], Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008], Ramalingegowda and Yu [2012]). 
We also estimate model (1) using dimensional conservatism ranks (i.e., negative non-operating accruals, relative earnings skewness, and unrecorded reserves on the balance sheet) as the dependent variable. Dimensional results in panel B of table 4 also provide similar evidence to those in column (iii) of panel A, suggesting that our result on the composite conservatism measure is not driven by a particular measure of conservatism. Overall, the results in table 4 are consistent with the notion that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms increased conservatism as a response to the 1991 court ruling.27 
27 To test robustness of our main ﬁndings to the confounding effects of ﬁrm-level characteristics, we run the following sensitivity tests: (1) as presented in online appendix table A4, we include a full set of interaction terms of control variables with DEL, HEDF93, DEL×HEDF93, POST, POST×DEL, POST×HEDF93, and POST×DEL×HEDF93, respectively. Our results remain qualitatively similar to those reported in table 4 (β7 for CRANK ALL = 0.794, t-stat = 3.59). (2) In the online appendix table A5, we add controls for a ﬁrm’s business process, i.e.,

DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
In additional analyses presented in online appendix table A6, we examine whether our main ﬁnding in column (iii) of table 4, panel A is robust to alternative deﬁnitions of near insolvency. This test is important because it is possible that, since the EDF measure we employ to identify near insolvent ﬁrms is based on accounting and stock performance, it could already capture effects of conservatism, potentially biasing our results. To corroborate our ﬁndings, we construct three alternative measures of near insolvency: (i) HMLEV93, an indicator variable equal to 1 if the ﬁrm is in the top quartile of 1993 market leverage distribution and 0 otherwise, where market leverage is measured as the ratio of shortand long-term debt to shortand long-term debt plus market value of equity; (ii) HBLEV93, an indicator variable equal to 1 if the ﬁrm is in the top quartile of 1993 book leverage distribution and 0 otherwise, where book leverage is measured as the ratio of shortand long-term debt to total assets; and (iii) LALT93, an indicator variable that equals 1 if the ﬁrm falls in the bottom quartile of distribution of Altman’s Z-score in 1993 and 0 otherwise. Results using alternative near insolvency measures remain generally consistent with those reported in table 4 except the one using LALT93, which is signiﬁcant at a one-tailed test (β7 = 0.153, t-stat = 1.44). 5.2 RESULTS ON THE ROLE OF BOARD CHARACTERISTICS 
We use a single board governance measure BSCORE, which combines four dimensional board characteristics to explore the effect of board characteristics on conservatism in the post-ruling period because biographical information on directors is available to us only for years 1993–1996 (results reported in table 5). We start our analysis in this subsample with the baseline regression without board measures, and the result in column (i) suggests that, in the post-ruling period, the difference in conservatism between near insolvent and not near insolvent ﬁrms is larger for ﬁrms incorporated in Delaware than those incorporated elsewhere. Column (ii) in table 5 presents the main result of model (2), and column (iii) further includes the interaction terms of ﬁrm characteristics with the ruling-related variables, i.e., DEL, HEDF93, and DEL×HEDF93. The positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient on BSCORE×DEL×HEDF93 in column (iii) (β7 = 0.397, t-stat = 2.39) combined with the insigniﬁcant coefﬁcient on DEL×HEDF93 indicates that the higher post-ruling conservatism level in near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms is driven by ﬁrms with stronger boards. In a supplemental analysis tabulated in online appendix table A7, we provide evidence on dimensional measures of board strength and ﬁnd that β7 is similarly positive and signiﬁcant at conventional levels for all board measures except industry expertise, the result of which is marginally signiﬁcant in a one-tailed

test (β7 = 0.407, t-stat = 1.41). Taken together, the evidence on the effect of court ruling on ﬁrms with stronger boards provides further support to the main hypothesis that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms increase their conservatism in the post-ruling period, and the effect of the court ruling is achieved through the board of directors’ channel. 
5.3 RESULTS USING ASYMMETRIC TIMELINESS MODELS OF CONSERVATISM 
5.3.1. Asymmetric Timeliness of Earnings. Results of model (3) are shown in table 6. In column (i), we ﬁrst constrain our sample to Delaware ﬁrms and vary their near insolvency status. Consistent with prior literature, β3, the coefﬁcient on timeliness of bad news recognition (D×RET) is positive and signiﬁcant (0.223, t-stat = 3.59). Moreover, consistent with our hypothesis, the post-ruling increase in asymmetric timeliness of earnings for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms is signiﬁcantly larger than that of non-near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms (coefﬁcient on HEDF93×POST×D×RET = 0.143, t-stat = 2.49). In column (ii), we constrain our sample to near insolvent ﬁrms only and allow Delaware incorporation status to vary. We ﬁnd that the post-ruling increase in conservatism is signiﬁcantly larger for near insolvent

This table presents regression estimates to test the effect of the 1991 Delaware court ruling on conditional conservatism as measured by asymmetric timeliness of earnings per Basu [1997] as in model 3. The sample includes 17,533 observations for 2,460 ﬁrms spanning calendar years 1988–1991 and 1993–1996. X/P is earnings per share scaled by year beginning price. RET is buy-and-hold stock returns for the year. D is a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if RET < 0 and 0 otherwise. Controls include LNMVE, LEV, BTM, GROWTH, LITIG, INSTOWN, STDRET (which is the daily stock return volatility during the prior year) and LNPRC (which is log of year-beginning stock price). All other variables are calculated as deﬁned in the appendix. All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles.

Delaware ﬁrms than for near insolvent non-Delaware ﬁrms (coefﬁcient on DEL×POST×D×RET = 0.214, t-stat = 2.92). Finally, we allow both Delaware incorporation and near insolvency status of a ﬁrm to vary in the full sample and present a complete version of model (3) in column (iii). β31, the coefﬁcient on our main variable of interest (HEDF93×DEL×POST×D×RET), is positive and signiﬁcant (0.172, t-stat = 2.22), suggesting that the post-ruling increase in asymmetric timeliness of earnings is stronger for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms. Our results similarly hold when we omit control variables and their interaction terms from model (3). These results are shown in online appendix table A8. 
5.3.2. Asymmetric Timeliness of Accruals. We present results of model (4) in table 7. In column (i), we ﬁrst constrain our sample to Delaware ﬁrms and vary their near insolvency status. Consistent with our expectation, near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms exhibit a higher increase in asymmetric timeliness of accruals after the ruling than non-near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms (coefﬁcient on HEDF93×POST×DCF×CF = 0.448, t-stat = 3.47). Similarly, in column (ii), near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms increase asymmetric timeliness of accruals signiﬁcantly more than near insolvent non-Delaware ﬁrms (coefﬁcient on DEL×POST×DCF×CF = 0.343, t-stat = 2.17). Finally, when allowing both Delaware incorporation and near insolvency status to vary (see column (iii)), we ﬁnd that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms exhibit signiﬁcantly more asymmetric timeliness of accruals (coefﬁcient on HEDF93×DEL×POST×DCF×CF = 0.444, t-stat = 2.31). Our results continue to hold when we omit control variables and their interaction terms from model (4) (see online appendix table A9). 
Overall, results on asymmetric timeliness of earnings (table 6) and asymmetric timeliness of accruals (table 7) supplement our main results on yearspeciﬁc conservatism ranks in table 4, and provide further support to our main hypothesis that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms respond to the 1991 court ruling by increasing ﬁnancial reporting conservatism. 
6. Additional Analyses 
We conduct a number of supplemental analyses to test the robustness of the empirical models and rule out alternative explanations for our results. 
6.1 OTHER CORPORATE DECISIONS 
The natural experiment setting helps us attribute the change in conservatism around the court ruling to debtholders’ demand. However, it is still possible that other corporate decisions that accompanied the ruling may drive the change in conservatism. For example, near insolvent ﬁrms may undertake a number of operational changes, such as writing off assets and reducing capital expenditure, to improve proﬁtability and/or increase liquidity, which could manifest themselves in the form of more conservative accounting policies. Because creditors could demand these actions as a

near insolvent ﬁrm approaches default and, in particular, if debt covenants are violated,28 such one-time actions could disproportionally affect near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms in the post-ruling period. We therefore identify a number of control variables for operating and real changes to isolate the effect of the court ruling on conservatism. 
6.1.1. Real Actions. Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein [1994] show that, as ﬁrms approach distress, they engage in asset sales, or improve their operating efﬁciency through optimizing the inventory and discretionary expenditure policies. The authors also suggest that better performing distressed ﬁrms are more likely to avoid insolvency. To mitigate the concern that our observed change in conservatism could be driven by real actions taken by ﬁrms, we augment our model (1) with additional controls for the following real actions: (i) DEC CAPEX, a dichotomous variable equal to one if a ﬁrm’s capital expenditure decreases when compared to the prior year and zero otherwise; (ii) INC SPPE, a dichotomous variable equal to one if a ﬁrm’s sale of PP&E increases from the prior year and zero otherwise; (iii) DEC NSEG, a dichotomous variable equal its business or geographic segments during the year and zero otherwise; (iv) NABN DISEXP, (−1) × abnormal discretionary expenses (Roychowdhury [2006]), and (v) NABN PROD, (−1) × abnormal production costs (Roychowdhury [2006]). As reported in table 8, we continue to ﬁnd the coefﬁcient on POST×DEL×HEDF93 to be positive and signiﬁcant when either controlling for the ﬁve real actions variables themselves (column (i): β7 = 0.472, t-stat = 3.67), or controlling for both these variables and their interactions with all the seven ruling-related variables (column (ii): β7 = 0.326, t-stat = 1.70). In sum, the robust results after controlling for real actions corroborate the main ﬁndings in table 4 and lend stronger support to our hypothesis. 
to one if a ﬁrm decreases the number of 
6.1.2. Special Items. Negative special items could be one mechanism through which ﬁrms adopt more accounting conservatism (Callen, Segal, and Hope [2010]). To the extent that negative special items, for example, one-time write-offs, could be more prevalent among near insolvent ﬁrms, the presence of negative special items could confound our results. We control for the presence of negative special items by including sales-deﬂated negative special items SI, which is equal to (−1) × SPI/SALES if SPI < 0 and 0 otherwise, and its interactions with all the seven ruling-related variables in addition to other control variables in model (1). The results (online appendix table A10) show that controlling for the effect of negative special items on conservatism as well as their possible variations along 
28 For instance, Chava and Roberts [2008] show that capital expenditures decrease following violations of debt covenants. Tan [2013] further elaborates on the mechanism of how creditors can impose restructuring changes on defaulting borrowers.

This table presents regression estimates to test the effect of the 1991 Delaware court ruling on conservatism rank after controlling for effects of real actions.

the court ruling does not change the tenor of our main inferences (coefﬁcient on POST×DEL×HEDF93 = 0.447, t-stat = 3.26). 6.2 DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
Alternatively, our ﬁndings could be driven by the demand for conservatism from stakeholders other than creditors, who may also inﬂuence the 
J. K. AIER, L. CHEN, AND M. PEVZNER 
extent of conservatism in ﬁnancial reporting. Moreover, a shift of control rights to creditors or recorded losses in prior years may also explain debtholders’ increased demand for conservatism. To rule out these alternative explanations, we conduct additional tests as explained later. 
6.2.1. Recorded Losses. Recorded losses are mechanically correlated with increases in conservatism and thus could confound our results. We rule out this concern by excluding ﬁrms most likely to have recorded large losses, which include (i) ﬁrms that experience most negative earnings changes (i.e., in the lowest decile of the distribution of earnings change), (ii) ﬁrms with negative operating cash ﬂows yet positive net income, (iii) ﬁrms whose total liabilities exceed total assets, and (iv) ﬁrms whose current liabilities exceed current assets. After dropping 5,737 observations that meet at least one of these criteria, we continue to ﬁnd a post-ruling increase in conservatism among near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms in this non-losses subsample (ß7 = 0.329, t-stat = 2.01). These results are summarized in online appendix table A11. 
6.2.2. Covenant Violations and Bankruptcies. Covenant violations may confound our ﬁndings in two opposite ways. On one hand, distressed ﬁrms are more likely to violate debt covenants (Dichev and Skinner [2002]), and any consequent revisions to loan agreements could give lenders more inﬂuence in ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial reporting decisions (Nini, Smith, and Suﬁ [2012]). On the other hand, once covenants are actually violated, additional conservatism may provide little incremental beneﬁt to creditors because control rights shift to creditors anyway, and creditors can monitor borrowers directly.29 However, there is no a priori reason to believe that the likelihood of covenant violations is systematically higher or lower for Delaware than non-Delaware ﬁrms. Since the covenant violations data provided by Nini, Smith, and Suﬁ [2012] start from 1996 only, we manually collect covenant violations from Mergent/Moody’s Manuals for a random subsample about 10% of our main sample size.30 On this subsample, we ﬁrst run a logit regression model where we use an indicator variable for covenant violations as the dependent variable and keep all the right-hand side variables speciﬁed in model (1). The results presented in panel A of online appendix table A12 suggest that the post-ruling increase in the likelihood of violating covenant is not signiﬁcantly higher for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms 
29 Recent research, however, disputes that notion and shows that even after covenants are violated ﬁrms adopt more accounting conservatism (Wang, Xie, and Xin [2011], Tan [2013]). 30 To keep the hand collection effort reasonable and representative, we randomly select 10% of both treatment and control samples to obtain 271 ﬁrms (30 treatment and 241 control ﬁrms), which represent 1,807 ﬁrm-year observations across all sample years. Our hand collection yields a total of 116 covenant violations in 72 out of the 271 ﬁrms. The ﬁrm-level violation occurrence rate of 26.6% in our sample is higher than the 10–20% in Nini, Smith, and Suﬁ [2012], possibly due to the presentation of near insolvent ﬁrms and earlier years in our sample. 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
1019 (ß7 = −0.915, t-stat = −0.83), that is, the court ruling does not seem to exert an effect on covenant violations similar to its effect on conservatism. In our analyses of this hand-collected subsample, summarized in panel B of online appendix table A12, the main results still hold either including a control variable for covenant violations (column (i): ß7 = 0.778, t-stat = 2.19) or dropping the covenant violation observations (column (ii): ß7 = 0.691, t-stat = 1.82). In addition, while near insolvency does not necessarily lead to bankruptcy, voluntary ﬁlings for bankruptcy (chapters 7 or 11) or courtinitiated bankruptcy proceedings could require ﬁrms to follow liquidation basis of accounting, which may be correlated with our conservatism measure. Following Shumway [1997], we identify six ﬁrms (26 ﬁrm-year observations) that were delisted due to bankruptcy (CRSP delisting code 574) at any time during the period 1988–1996. We still obtain results in line with our hypothesis when we exclude these 26 bankruptcy observations from our sample (ß7 = 0.483, t-stat = 3.77). These results are summarized in column (iii) of panel B in online appendix table A12. 
6.2.3. Other Stakeholders. Our results could be driven by the inﬂuence of auditors, as opposed to debtholders, on accounting conservatism. Prior studies show that ﬁrms audited by Big-N auditors have higher reporting conservatism and better earnings quality (Francis and Krishnan [1999], Francis, Maydew, and Sparks [1999]). To rule out this confounding factor, we regress conservatism ranks on a dichotomous variable BIGN (equal to one if the ﬁrm is audited by a Big-N auditor and zero otherwise) and its interactions with the seven ruling-related variables in addition to the other controls. The coefﬁcient on POST×DEL×HEDF93 remains positive and signiﬁcant (ß7 = 0.322, t-stat = 1.69) after controlling for the Big-N auditors effect, while the sign on BIGN×POST×DEL×HEDF93 is not signiﬁcant (see online appendix table A13, panel A). 
Furthermore, our results could be driven by CEO/CFOs’ inﬂuence on accounting quality since higher managerial ownership mitigates the severity of the agency problems and thus reduces the demand for conservatism (LaFond and Roychowdhury [2008]). To address this concern, we conduct a post-ruling analysis (since Execucomp data are unavailable for the pre-ruling period) similar to model (2) with BSCORE replaced by the CEO/CFO ownership percentage, EXEOWN. As presented in panel B of online appendix table A13, after controlling for the effect of CEO/CFO ownership, the main variable of interest DEL×HEDF93 remains signiﬁcantly positive (ß3 = 1.282, t-stat = 2.86) in the full model. 
6.2.4. Tax-Related Incentives. Firms may adopt conservatism to reduce the present value of tax payments (Watts [2003]). Similar to Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008], in online appendix table A14, we control for the tax status of the ﬁrm by incorporating the simulated corporate marginal tax rate of the prior year based on income after interest expense has been 
J. K. AIER, L. CHEN, AND M. PEVZNER 
deducted.31 We follow Graham and Mills [2008] to ﬁll in missing values. Our main results remain similar to those reported in table 4 (coefﬁcient on POST×DEL×HEDF93 = 0.829, t-stat = 4.64) after controlling for the tax-related incentives. 
6.3 CONTROLLING FOR FIRM PERFORMANCE 
To rule out the concern that the differential change in conservatism between treatment and control groups may be driven by the confounding changes in ﬁrm performance, as opposed to the court ruling, we conduct the following tests. 
6.3.1. Sample Matched on Accounting Performance. An alternative explanation for our results could be that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms in the sample have experienced stronger performance deteriorations than near insolvent non-Delaware ﬁrms. To rule out this concern, we perform a matched sample analysis, whereby we match every Delaware ﬁrm with a non-Delaware ﬁrm with either the closest ROA or the closest change in ROA in the same year and the same two-digit SIC industry. We continue to ﬁnd that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms exhibit higher conservatism in the post-ruling period (e.g., in the sample matched by ROA, the coefﬁcient on POST×DEL×HEDF93 = 0.347, t-stat = 2.00). These results are reported in columns (i) and (ii) of panel A in the online appendix table A15. 
6.3.2. Holding Firms’ Near Insolvency Status Constant. It is possible that, throughout our sample period, Delaware ﬁrms moved out of near insolvency status, thereby taking themselves out of the scope of the court ruling. To address this concern, we restrict our sample to those Delaware and nonDelaware ﬁrms that consistently appear to be near insolvent, i.e., with annual EDF scores consistently in the highest quartile (693 observations) or consistently above median (3,774 observations) throughout the sample period. As our results in columns (iii) and (iv) in panel A of online appendix table A15 indicate, the effect of the court ruling on conservatism for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms remains positive and signiﬁcant (column (iii): ß7 = 1.584, t-stat = 1.88; column (iv): ß7 = 0.624, t-stat = 2.75) when ﬁrms’ near insolvency status is held constant. Thus, our ﬁndings do not appear to be confounded by Delaware ﬁrms moving out of the near insolvency zone. 
6.3.3. Shorter Preand Post-Ruling Periods. As we discuss in section 3.1, a fundamental assumption in our paper is that a ﬁrm’s near insolvency status does not change throughout the whole sample period. In order to minimize concerns about the ﬁxed near insolvency measure across years, we rerun model (1) using shorter preand post-ruling sample periods and summarize the results in panel B of online appendix table A15. Speciﬁcally, 
31 We thank John Graham for providing us with these data (https://faculty.fuqua. 
duke.edu/ßjgraham/taxform.html). 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
we ﬁnd that the estimated effect of the ruling on conservatism for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms is consistently positive and signiﬁcant for two-year (ß7 = 0.369, t-stat = 1.45), four-year (ß7 = 0.428, t-stat = 2.42), and six-year (ß7 = 0.513, t-stat = 3.54) event windows.32 The robustness of results on shortened event windows further supports our main ﬁndings by not only validating our deﬁnition of HEDF93 but also ruling out the possible confounding events during a longer period. 
6.4 CONTROLLING FOR POSSIBLE SELECTION BIASES 
A ﬁrm’s state of incorporation and near insolvency status may not be random; rather, they can be driven by factors that also affect ﬁnancial reporting choices. We address such selection biases using Propensity Score Matching methodology. 
6.4.1. Possible Selection Bias of Near Insolvent Firms. Deteriorating performance and/or ﬁnancial constraints systematically drive ﬁrms to be near insolvent. We control for such variables by implementing propensity score matching on ﬁrms’ near insolvency status. In the ﬁrst stage, we estimate a logit regression model following Jones and Hensher [2004], where the explanatory variables for the probability of HEDF93 = 1 include a new economy indicator, cash resources deﬂated by total assets, operating cash ﬂow deﬂated by total assets, debt–equity ratio, cash ﬂow interest coverage ratio (i.e., operating cash ﬂow deﬂated by net interest expense), and industry and year dummies as tabulated in panel A of online appendix table A16. We then use the predicted propensity of being near insolvent obtained from this model to match non-near insolvent ﬁrms (HEDF93 = 0) with near insolvent ﬁrms (HEDF93 = 1). In this matched sample we again ﬁnd that the post-ruling increase in conservatism is larger for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms (ß7 = 0.385, t-stat = 2.15)—see panel B of online appendix table A16. 
6.4.2. Possible Selection Bias of State of Incorporation. Prior studies suggest that ﬁrms strategically choose to incorporate in certain states like Delaware, and this decision can improve ﬁrm value (Daines [2001], Bebchuk and Cohen [2003]). More recently, Litwak [2011] provides evidence that the results of increased ﬁrm value and performance among Delaware incorporated ﬁrms disappear after controlling for the general choice of out-of-state incorporation. Although the literature is in disagreement over the inﬂuence of Delaware incorporation choice on ﬁrm behaviors, we still conduct an additional analysis by matching Delaware and non-Delaware companies 
32 The marginal signiﬁcance for the two-year event window is probably due to two reasons: (1) conservatism measures are estimated over multiple years (e.g., C ACCR and C SKEW) to mitigate the impact of any temporary large accruals, and thus the change in conservatism over a short period may be small; (2) the effect of the ruling may also need more than one year to take hold. 
J. K. AIER, L. CHEN, AND M. PEVZNER 
based on ﬁrms’ propensity to incorporate in Delaware to rule out the concern that the observed post-ruling increase in conservatism in near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms is related to factors that have driven the ﬁrm’s decision to incorporate in Delaware. We ﬁrst estimate the probability of being incorporated in Delaware using ﬁrm characteristics identiﬁed by Bebchuk and Cohen [2003], which include log of sales, Tobin’s Q, ROA, number of employees, ﬁrm age, indicator variables for the state of business, and twodigit SIC industry dummies (see panel A of online appendix table A17). In the sample matched on the propensity score of being incorporated in Delaware, our main result on the larger post-ruling increase in conservatism for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms (ß7 = 0.394, t-stat = 1.82) remains consistent with those reported in table 4 (see panel B of online appendix table A17). 6.5 OTHER CONFOUNDING EVENTS 
Last, our ﬁnding may be confounded by events that were concurrent to the court ruling in 1991. For example, a number of state antitakeover laws came into effect in the late 1980s–early 1990s and the passage of some of these laws coincided with our sample period. Armstrong, Balakrishnan, and Cohen [2012] document that Delaware adopted a stronger version of these laws in 1988, and further ﬁnd that the adoption of state antitakeover laws led to increased ﬁnancial statement informativeness. Their results suggest that the adoption of antitakeover provisions could confound our ﬁnding of increased accounting conservatism after the 1991 court ruling (Jayaraman and Shivakumar [2013]). To mitigate this concern, we extend the sample period to include the years 1998–2001, when adoptions of antitakeover laws should have been completed across all state jurisdictions and their possible effects on conservatism should be stable. We rerun our analysis on the extended period (i.e., 1988–1991 as pre-ruling period and 1993–2001 as post-ruling period) and still ﬁnd a positive and signiﬁcant sign on POST×DEL×HEDF93 (ß7 = 0.414, t-stat = 3.93) as reported in online appendix table A18. Therefore, the adoption of the state antitakeover laws is ruled out as an alternative explanation for our main results. 
7. Conclusion 
A 1991 Delaware court ruling expanded the scope of director ﬁduciary duties to include creditors for near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms. We exploit this natural event setting to establish a causal relation between accounting conservatism and debtholders’ demand. We ﬁnd that near insolvent Delaware ﬁrms increased their conservatism in the period following the court ruling and this effect is more pronounced in near insolvent Delaware companies with stronger boards. The results are robust to alternative measures of conservatism and near insolvency status, controlling for operational changes, covenant violations, declines in ﬁrm performance, selection biases of the near insolvency status and the state of incorporation, 
DEBTHOLDERS’ DEMAND FOR CONSERVATISM 
other stakeholders’ demand for conservatism, and confounding events like the adoption of state antitakeover laws. Our ﬁndings provide evidence to support the casual link between debtholders’ demand and accounting conservatism as suggested in the literature. The study also offers some insights into the role of boards in ﬁnancial reporting and suggests that litigation risk arising from ﬁduciary obligations is one reason why boards may inﬂuence ﬁnancial reporting decisions.
