<P>These words, all relatively formal, indicate the taking in of one thing by another. <B><FONT color=blue>Absorb</FONT></B> is slightly more informal than the others and has, perhaps, the widest range of uses. In its most restricted sense, it suggests the taking in or soaking up specifically of liquids: the ink <I><FONT color=brown>absorbed</FONT></I> by the blotter. In more general uses, it may imply the thoroughness of the action: not merely to read the chapter, but to <I><FONT color=brown>absorb</FONT></I> its meaning. Or it may stress the complete disappearance of the thing taken in within the encompassing medium: once-lovely countryside <I><FONT color=brown>absorbed</FONT></I> by urban sprawl. <B><FONT color=blue>Ingest</FONT></B> refers literally to the action of taking into the mouth, as food or drugs, for later <I><FONT color=brown>absorption</FONT></I> by the body. Figuratively it designates any taking in, and suggests the receptivity necessary for such a process: too tired to <I><FONT color=brown>ingest</FONT></I> even one more idea from the complicated philosophical essay he was reading. To <B><FONT color=blue>digest</FONT></B> is to alter food chemically in the digestive tract so that it can be <I><FONT color=brown>absorbed</FONT></I> into the bloodstream. In other uses, <I><FONT color=brown>digest</FONT></I> is like <I><FONT color=brown>absorb</FONT></I> in stressing thoroughness, but is even more emphatic. [You may completely <I><FONT color=brown>absorb</FONT></I> a stirring play in one evening, but you will be months <I><FONT color=brown>digesting</FONT></I> it.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Assimilate</FONT></B> is even more emphatic about the thoroughness of the taking in than either <I><FONT color=brown>absorb</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>digest</FONT></I> ?in both its specific physiological and general uses. Physiologically, food is first <I><FONT color=brown>digested</FONT></I>, then <I><FONT color=brown>absorbed</FONT></I> by the bloodstream, and then <I><FONT color=brown>assimilated</FONT></I> bit by bit in each cell the blood passes. In more general uses, <I><FONT color=brown>assimilate</FONT></I>, unlike previous words, often implies a third agent beside the <I><FONT color=brown>absorber</FONT></I> and the <I><FONT color=brown>absorbed</FONT></I> ?an agent that directs this process: the architect who <I><FONT color=brown>assimilates</FONT></I> his building to its environment. The process, furthermore, often implies the complete transformation of the <I><FONT color=brown>absorbed</FONT></I> into the <I><FONT color=brown>absorbing</FONT></I> medium. <I><FONT color=brown>Assimilate</FONT></I> also suggests a much slower process than <I><FONT color=brown>digest</FONT></I> and certainly than <I><FONT color=brown>absorb</FONT></I>, which can be nearly instantaneous: It would take the city generations to <I><FONT color=brown>assimilate</FONT></I> the newcomers into the patterns of a strange life.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Incorporate</FONT></B> is the only word here that does not have a specific use pertaining to the taking in of liquids or of food, meaning literally "to embody." It compares to that aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>assimilate</FONT></I> which stresses the loss of separate identity for the absorbed quantity: <I><FONT color=brown>incorporating</FONT></I> your proposals into a new system that will satisfy everyone. It is unlike <I><FONT color=brown>assimilate</FONT></I> in lacking that word’s suggestion of necessarily careful, time-consuming thoroughness.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Imbibe</FONT></B>, while capable of uses comparable to those for <I><FONT color=brown>assimilate</FONT></I>, is mainly rooted still to its specific use for the taking in of liquids. Even this use, and certainly any others, now sound slightly archaic and excessively formal: Do you <I><FONT color=brown>imbibe</FONT></I> alcoholic beverages?</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eat">EAT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: disgorge, disperse, dissipate, eject, emit, exude.</P>

To <B><FONT color=blue>forbear</FONT></B>, in its intransitive sense, is to exercise self-control, often out of motives of patience or charity.

<P>These words refer to things kept secret or hidden or to things difficult to perceive or understand. <B><FONT color=blue>Obscure</FONT></B> is the most general and least formal of these; it is now most often used to indicate things indistinct or difficult to grasp, although it still may reflect its derivation from a root meaning dark. [The letters of the sign were made <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I> by rain; <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I>, involuted reasoning that only served to confuse his audience; a path that grew more and more <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I> in the fading light.] When the reference is to understanding, the word may imply disapproval because something is not clear: misled by the deliberately <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I> language of the contract. The word may refer with greater neutrality to something that is not clear. Without necessarily implying any intent to confuse: references that were perfectly apparent in his own time but that have long since become <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cryptic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>arcane</FONT></B> specifically stress things that are hidden or that have been deliberately made remote from easy understanding. <I><FONT color=brown>Arcane</FONT></I> can flatly refer to something kept secret as a mystery: <I><FONT color=brown>arcane</FONT></I> religious symbols that only the high priest could interpret. More generally, it may refer to a purposely pedantic reliance on obscure references in order to show off one’s own learning; in this sense, the word, like <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I>, can carry a disapproving tone: <I><FONT color=brown>arcane</FONT></I> footnotes that not even a specialist in the field could be expected to understand. <I><FONT color=brown>Cryptic</FONT></I> may refer to the occult, but more generally it indicates something enigmatic or puzzling, often something deliberately made to seem meaningless, except to the initiated: <I><FONT color=brown>cryptic</FONT></I> signs and handclasps that were part of the lodge’s ritual. The word may also refer to something too brief to be understood: a <I><FONT color=brown>cryptic</FONT></I>, one-word clue.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abstruse</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>recondite</FONT></B> may refer to things secret, hidden or difficult to grasp, but their special area of usage here is in referring to scholarly complexity. <I><FONT color=brown>Abstruse</FONT></I> suggests a formal or learned style filled with difficulties that tax the mind: <I><FONT color=brown>abstruse</FONT></I> legal documents that supported his claim. <I><FONT color=brown>Recondite</FONT></I> is even more emphatic about the difficulty or complexity of a study or approach: needing fewer <I><FONT color=brown>recondite</FONT></I> books on the subject and more that might help a layman to understand the new discoveries. Hence, by extension, the word can refer to knowledge remote from the mainstream and available only to a few authorities: the <I><FONT color=brown>recondite</FONT></I> teachings of a minor medieval philosopher.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Mystical">MYSTICAL</A>, <A href="entry://Vague">VAGUE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clear">CLEAR</A>, explicit, <A href="entry://Plain">PLAIN</A>, transparent.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Absurd</FONT></B> means opposed to reason or truth, and may be applied to that which is grossly, and sometimes grotesquely, inconsistent with common sense or experience. <B><FONT color=blue>Preposterous</FONT></B> denotes a great contrariness to nature, reason, or common sense, and is used to describe that which is outrageously <I><FONT color=brown>absurd</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Ridiculous</FONT></B> refers to that which is <I><FONT color=brown>absurd</FONT></I> in a way that invites <I><FONT color=brown>ridicule</FONT></I> or mockery. [It is <I><FONT color=brown>absurd</FONT></I> to predict that the sun will not rise tomorrow; it is <I><FONT color=brown>preposterous</FONT></I> that virtue should go unrewarded while vice goes unpunished; It is <I><FONT color=brown>ridiculous</FONT></I> to judge a foreign culture by its plumbing.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Farcical</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ludicrous</FONT></B> are applied to that which is <I><FONT color=brown>absurd</FONT></I> in an amusing way. <I><FONT color=brown>Farcical</FONT></I> indicates a humorous distortion of fact, convention or reason. <I><FONT color=brown>Ludicrous</FONT></I> implies playful <I><FONT color=brown>absurdity</FONT></I>, but may also be synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>ridiculous</FONT></I> in describing something that is greeted with scorn or derision. [The <I><FONT color=brown>farcical</FONT></I> introduction of a talking horse gave the play its flavour; The <I><FONT color=brown>ludicrous</FONT></I> antics of the harlequins delighted the audience; The speaker made a series of <I><FONT color=brown>ludicrous</FONT></I> mistakes which were rewarded with hoots and catcalls.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Foolish</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>senseless</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>silly</FONT></B> add a suggestion of folly or even of a trivial intellect to their synonymity with <I><FONT color=brown>absurd</FONT></I>.

<P>These words refer to what occurs either unexpectedly or without pre-arrangement or plan. <B><FONT color=blue>Chance</FONT></B> is the least formal of these. On one hand it can indicate coincidence: a <I><FONT color=brown>chance</FONT></I> meeting in the street. On the other, it can suggest an occurrence that is governed by no known physical laws: the development of quantum theory to explain seemingly <I><FONT color=brown>chance</FONT></I> events in the interaction of atomic particles. <B><FONT color=blue>Accidental</FONT></B> stresses the lack of intention or forethought, but is now strongly influenced by accident, meaning mishap, to suggest an error that brings undesirable or even disastrous results: an <I><FONT color=brown>accidental</FONT></I> misreading of her bank balance; the spectre of an <I><FONT color=brown>accidental</FONT></I> nuclear holocaust. <B><FONT color=blue>Fortuitous</FONT></B> can point to something that is apparently without cause or design, but it often suggests a good or desirable occurrence, an overtone that puts the word in the strongest possible contrast with accidental: a <I><FONT color=brown>fortuitous</FONT></I> change of plan that kept them out of the city during the <I><FONT color=brown>accidental</FONT></I> blackout.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Contingent</FONT></B> can refer, most simply, to what is unexpected or unforeseen: a <I><FONT color=brown>contingent</FONT></I> thunderstorm that scattered the marchers. More often, the word points to something that is dependent on an uncertain event or condition; in this case the word is used with <I><FONT color=brown>on or upon</FONT></I>: an increase in your allowance that is <I><FONT color=brown>contingent upon</FONT></I> how well you do in your studies.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Incidental</FONT></B> points to something occurring without design or regularity: an <I><FONT color=brown>incidental</FONT></I> shrub or two beside the path. Thus, the word can refer to something unplanned or unexpected, but usually of value, however sight, especially when this is a concomitant or side benefit gained in the pursuit of some other goal: an <I><FONT color=brown>incidental</FONT></I> knowledge of Montagnard folksongs gained during his service in Vietnam. <B><FONT color=blue>Adventitious</FONT></B> can be a much more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>incidental</FONT></I>, pointing to a fortuitous acquisition or coming together: <I><FONT color=brown>adventitious</FONT></I> circumstances that encouraged the rise of capitalism. Like <I><FONT color=brown>incidental</FONT></I>, the word can also indicate something that is not inherent, particularly something that is extrinsic to a primary consideration: <I><FONT color=brown>adventitious</FONT></I> flaws that did not detract from the power of the time-battered piece of sculpture.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Marginal">MARGINAL</A>, <A href="entry://Provisional">PROVISIONAL</A>, <A href="entry://Random">RANDOM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conclusive">CONCLUSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Inevitable">INEVITABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Inexorable">INEXORABLE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Accompany</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>attend</FONT></B> are alike in meaning to go with, but each suggests a different relationship between persons. We <I><FONT color=brown>accompany</FONT></I> our equals, and <I><FONT color=brown>attend</FONT></I> those to whom we would show courtesy or to whom we are subordinate. When they refer to things, <I><FONT color=brown>accompany</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>attend</FONT></I> mean to be present with as a result of.

To <I><FONT color=brown>convoy</FONT></I> means to accompany ships or vehicles for protection, while to <I><FONT color=brown>escort</FONT></I> is to go with them, or with persons, either for the purpose of guarding or as a mark of courtesy. Militarily, a land movement is <I><FONT color=brown>escorted</FONT></I>, a sea movement <I><FONT color=brown>convoyed</FONT></I>. During World War II, merchant ships were <I><FONT color=brown>convoyed</FONT></I> across the Pacific by the Navy. A troop march may be <I><FONT color=brown>escorted</FONT></I> by armed vehicles. As a mark of courtesy, a ship making its maiden voyage is <I><FONT color=brown>escorted</FONT></I> by other craft in or out of the harbour. A boy is expected to <I><FONT color=brown>escort</FONT></I> his date to the door.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chaperon</FONT></B> means to accompany, but carries the implication of guidance or supervision in the interests of protection or propriety.

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Accomplice</FONT></B> and <I><FONT color=brown>confederate</FONT></I> both denote a person who is associated with another in the perpetration of a crime, whether that association is limited to the planning stages or is extended to the entire execution of the wrongdoing. Thus, an <I><FONT color=brown>accomplice</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>confederate</FONT></I> may, but need not necessarily, be present at the scene of the crime. [The role of the murderer’s <I><FONT color=brown>accomplice</FONT></I> was that of weapon procurer; Although Fredericks planned the theft, it was one of his <I><FONT color=brown>confederates</FONT></I> who actually entered the house and stole the jewels.]</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>abettor</FONT></B> is an <I><FONT color=brown>accomplice</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>confederate</FONT></I> who is present and who participates in the execution of a crime.

<P>These words all refer to a history or statement of actual or purported events. A <B><FONT color=blue>report</FONT></B> is an official or formal statement, often made after an investigation and usually by a subordinate to his superior: a policeman’s <I><FONT color=brown>report</FONT></I> of a burglary. Whereas an <B><FONT color=blue>account</FONT></B> is a factual statement of events or conditions, usually given by an eyewitness, a <I><FONT color=brown>report</FONT></I> is an authoritative finding, often one based interpretation and deliberation of evidence. Thus a farmer may given an <I><FONT color=brown>account</FONT></I> of a plane crash he observed; later a <I><FONT color=brown>report</FONT></I> of the crash might be drawn up by the Department of Civil Aviation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Version</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>story</FONT></B> purport to be statements of fact. A <I><FONT color=brown>version</FONT></I> is one-sided, although not always deliberately so; it merely represents one person’s or one party’s point of view, and always implies an alternative to several other contrasting <I><FONT color=brown>accounts</FONT></I> of the same event. Although some degree of scepticism is commonly associated with <I><FONT color=brown>version</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> is regarded with even greater doubt. <I><FONT color=brown>Story</FONT></I> may even be used to suggest a conscious distortion of the truth.

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Accumulate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>amass</FONT></B> both mean to pile up by successive addition. To <I><FONT color=brown>accumulate</FONT></I> is to heap or pile up or bring together by degrees or by regular additions; to <I><FONT color=brown>amass</FONT></I> is to bring together a great quantity and usually suggests great value.

<P>These words all mean to declare a person to be guilty of some offence or shortcoming. <B><FONT color=blue>Accuse</FONT></B> is the most general word, and may be used in formal or informal, official or personal, contexts. An investigating committee may <I><FONT color=brown>accuse</FONT></I> an officeholder of wrongdoing; a neighbour may <I><FONT color=brown>accuse</FONT></I> a man of playing his radio too loudly.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Charge</FONT></B>, in this context, means to <I><FONT color=brown>accuse</FONT></I> formally, usually before a court; by extension, it means to <I><FONT color=brown>accuse</FONT></I> informally of a violation of some accepted standard. [The police <I><FONT color=brown>charged</FONT></I> the driver with reckless driving; The candidate <I><FONT color=brown>charged</FONT></I> his opponent with evasion of the basic issues.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Incriminate</FONT></B> means to <I><FONT color=brown>charge</FONT></I> a person with a crime directly, or to involve him in a crime by damaging testimony.

In an extended sense, <I><FONT color=brown>indict</FONT></I> is to charge unofficially but publicly: to <I><FONT color=brown>indict</FONT></I> a school of writing or painting as being obscurantist. To <I><FONT color=brown>arraign</FONT></I>, legally, is to call an <I><FONT color=brown>indicted</FONT></I> person before a court for trial; by extension, to <I><FONT color=brown>arraign</FONT></I> is to call publicly but unofficially a person or a movement to stand judgement before public opinion or some other standard.</P><P>Technically, <B><FONT color=blue>impeach</FONT></B> means to <I><FONT color=brown>arraign</FONT></I> a person ?usually a public official ?before a competent tribunal on a <I><FONT color=brown>charge</FONT></I> of treason or other high crime.

<P>An <B><FONT color=blue>act</FONT></B>, in the sense considered here, is something that is done. The <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I> may be done by a person, a group or an impersonal entity, and is not limited by motive, nature or result. Thus, an <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I> of God is a violent outbreak of nature; the <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I> of a maniac may endanger the community; the <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I> of a philanthropist may enrich it. While <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I> refers to something that is accomplished, <I><FONT color=brown>action</FONT></I> refers to the accomplishing of it or the process by which it is accomplished: the <I><FONT color=brown>action</FONT></I> of acid on metal.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deed</FONT></B>, while sometimes used to connote any <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I>, good or bad, big or small, is usually synonymous with <B><FONT color=blue>exploit</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>feat</FONT></B> in meaning an achievement of great courage, nobility, intelligence, strength or skill. An <I><FONT color=brown>exploit</FONT></I> is often a physical <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I>; discovering a continent, scaling a high mountain, rocketing to a distant planet, and descending to the ocean floor are all <I><FONT color=brown>exploits</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>feat</FONT></I> may also be a physical <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I>, but it applies to mental <I><FONT color=brown>acts</FONT></I> as well. [Formulating the General Theory of Relativity was a prodigious mental <I><FONT color=brown>feat</FONT></I>; Playing several chess games simultaneously while blindfolded is a remarkable and impressive <I><FONT color=brown>feat</FONT></I>.] A <I><FONT color=brown>deed</FONT></I> is generally an <I><FONT color=brown>act</FONT></I> that is noteworthy for its difficulty or nobility.

A military <I><FONT color=brown>operation</FONT></I> is a series of co-ordinated individual and group <I><FONT color=brown>acts</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>performance</FONT></I> of an employee is the manner in which he carries out the <I><FONT color=brown>acts</FONT></I> that are part of his job’s routine.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Method">METHOD</A>, <A href="entry://Perform">PERFORM</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to the idea that something is in fact what it is represented to be. In this sense <B><FONT color=blue>genuine</FONT></B> is the most general of this group of words, and applies to anything having the origin, authorship or character claimed for it: a <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> example of cuneiform inscription; a <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> painting by Goya; a <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> bargain. Sometimes the informal word <B><FONT color=blue>dinkum</FONT></B>, is used in these senses of <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I>, but it is mostly kept for adverbial use to assure one of the truth of something: It’s a fact, <I><FONT color=brown>fair dinkum</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Authentic</FONT></B> is often interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>authentic</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I>) antique. But <I><FONT color=brown>authentic</FONT></I> emphasizes formal proof or documentation that an article is what it is claimed to be, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> simply asserts that the article is not spurious, adulterated or counterfeit. [The geologists declared the fragment to be an <I><FONT color=brown>authentic</FONT></I> specimen of a rare fossil; an <I><FONT color=brown>authentic</FONT></I> Utrillo, verified by several art connoisseurs; an <I><FONT color=brown>authentic</FONT></I> replica of the drawing; <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> silver, unmixed with baser metals.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Actual</FONT></B> means existing in fact, not imaginary, and is synonymous with one sense of <B><FONT color=blue>real</FONT></B>: an <I><FONT color=brown>actual</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I>) event in history. <I><FONT color=brown>Actual</FONT></I>, however, need not refer to physically existent things, whereas real usually does in this sense: an <I><FONT color=brown>actual</FONT></I> change in the rules; It was a <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I> person, not someone invented in a dream. <I><FONT color=brown>Real</FONT></I> also means being in accordance with appearance or claim, not artificial or counterfeit, and is in this sense often synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I>) alibi; <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I>) money. The emphasis on appearance sometimes distinguishes <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I> from <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I> feast (i.e., a meal having the aspect of a feast); a <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I> lecher (i.e., a person having the appearance or manner of a lecher). <I><FONT color=brown>Genuine</FONT></I>, if used in these examples, would convey a more conspicuous sense of personal style and a greater degree of informality.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>True</FONT></B> means being <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>natural</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>true</FONT></I> specimen; <I><FONT color=brown>true</FONT></I> gold. In many context it is interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I>, and often with <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> as well: a <I><FONT color=brown>true</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I>) feast; a <I><FONT color=brown>true</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>real</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I>) solution to a problem. Note that true in some contexts, as in a <I><FONT color=brown>true</FONT></I> alibi, is ambiguous, in that it can mean either conforming to the facts of the matter (i.e., with the truth) or being in accordance with the appearance of a <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> alibi (i.e., not appearing spurious or contrived.) Obviously, a <I><FONT color=brown>true</FONT></I> alibi in the latter sense may well be false in <I><FONT color=brown>actual</FONT></I> fact.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accurate">ACCURATE</A>, <A href="entry://Exist">EXIST</A>, <A href="entry://Truthful">TRUTHFUL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artificial">ARTIFICIAL</A>, fake, forged, imaginary, <A href="entry://Spurious">SPURIOUS</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to a highly developed mental ability to see or understand what is not obvious. <B><FONT color=blue>Acumen</FONT></B> has to do with keenness of intellect, and implies an uncommon quickness and discrimination of mind. It requires <I><FONT color=brown>acumen</FONT></I> to solve an intricate problem in human relationships, or to emerge unscathed from a venture into the stock market.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Insight</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>perception</FONT></B> mean the power to recognize the hidden springs of behaviour or the true nature or cause of a situation or condition: A psychiatrist’s <I><FONT color=brown>insight</FONT></I> into human behaviour may uncover the underlying cause of a boy’s delinquency; a doctor’s <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I> may recognize a patient’s complaints as symptoms of a psychic disorder. <I><FONT color=brown>Perception</FONT></I> in its basic sense applies to anything recognized or understood by the senses, and in its extended sense to anything recognized or understood by the mind, thus suggesting a likeness between mind and the senses. <I><FONT color=brown>Perception</FONT></I> therefore suggests a view of the mind as a keenly receptive but none the less passive instrument, sensitive to very slight stimuli. Insight, on the other hand, is consistent with a view of the mind as an active agent, seeking and sifting ideas and probabilities as well as the evidence of sensations.

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Adapt</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>adjust</FONT></B> mean to change someone or something to suit new circumstances or a different environment. <B><FONT color=blue>Adapt</FONT></B> involves considerable change to meet new requirements, while <B><FONT color=blue>adjust</FONT></B> implies a minor change, as in the alignment of parts: to <I><FONT color=brown>adapt</FONT></I> a novel for the stage; to <I><FONT color=brown>adjust</FONT></I> a motor; to <I><FONT color=brown>adjust</FONT></I> the differences between two parties in a dispute. <I><FONT color=brown>Adapt</FONT></I> emphasizes the purpose for which the change must be made: The shred politician <I><FONT color=brown>adapts</FONT></I> his speech to suit the interests of his audience. <I><FONT color=brown>Adjust</FONT></I> is also used to mean to <I><FONT color=brown>adapt</FONT></I> oneself to a changed environment: Astronauts in flight must <I><FONT color=brown>adjust</FONT></I> to weightlessness.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conform</FONT></B>, as here considered, means to correspond to a model or pattern: The building must <I><FONT color=brown>conform</FONT></I> to the plans and specifications.

This last example may also be recast reflexively: to <I><FONT color=brown>conform</FONT></I> oneself to the habits of the natives. To <B><FONT color=blue>fit</FONT></B> something is to <I><FONT color=brown>adapt</FONT></I> it to a purpose or use: A prudent man <I><FONT color=brown>fits</FONT></I> his standard of living to his budget.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Accommodate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>reconcile</FONT></B> are similar to <I><FONT color=brown>adapt</FONT></I> in meaning to change something or oneself in acknowledgement of an external condition.

<P>These words suggest the ease with which something will respond to an external force without breaking. <B><FONT color=blue>Adaptable</FONT></B> is the most general and most abstract, suggesting the favourable quality of an ingenious or practical ability to alter habit as a response to changed circumstances: The ice ages exterminated many less <I><FONT color=brown>adaptable</FONT></I> species. <B><FONT color=blue>Yielding</FONT></B> is nearly as abstract as <I><FONT color=brown>adaptable</FONT></I> but more readily suggests an unfavourable passivity or unassertiveness than a favourable ability to improvise responses to challenges: the familiar stereotype that makes out all women as helpless and <I><FONT color=brown>yielding</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Flexible</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>elastic</FONT></B> have concrete applications to physical objects in which case they suggest something with spring to it or something that will quickly resume its shape after being distorted. <I><FONT color=brown>Elastic</FONT></I> suggests stretching, as of a band or membrane; <I><FONT color=brown>flexible</FONT></I> suggest bending, as of a rod or tube. <B><FONT color=blue>Adjustable</FONT></B> is applied to objects that can be manually altered to suit different uses or purposes: An <I><FONT color=brown>adjustable</FONT></I> car seat slides backwards or forwards to accommodate the driver.</P><P>Used in the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>adaptable</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>elastic</FONT></I> suggests the ability to recover quickly in the face of a threat or upset: a man who was amazingly <I><FONT color=brown>elastic</FONT></I> and imperturbable under pressure. <I><FONT color=brown>Elastic</FONT></I> can also refer to a projected set of requirements, rules, or figures, when they are open to revision in the light of experience: an <I><FONT color=brown>elastic</FONT></I> budget that allows for unexpected outlays for new equipment; <I><FONT color=brown>elastic</FONT></I>, sensible rules drawn up by the students themselves. <I><FONT color=brown>Flexible</FONT></I>, in this context, is closer in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>adaptable</FONT></I> than any other word here. It does not necessarily suggest a permanent adjustment to change but rather momentary shifts of position to maintain balance: a society so <I><FONT color=brown>flexible</FONT></I> in the face of new influences as to lack unity or purpose.

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Add</FONT></B>, the most general word in this group, means to join or unite so as to increase the importance, size, quantity or scope of something: to <I><FONT color=brown>add</FONT></I> a new line of merchandise to one’s goods; to <I><FONT color=brown>add</FONT></I> a new wing to a building; to <I><FONT color=brown>add</FONT></I> five new salesmen to a staff; to <I><FONT color=brown>add</FONT></I> a touch of levity to an otherwise solemn speed.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Attach</FONT></B>, as here considered, means to connect or join on as a part, and is close in some contexts to <B><FONT color=blue>append</FONT></B>: to <I><FONT color=brown>attach</FONT></I> a stipulation to a contract; to <I><FONT color=brown>append</FONT></I> a query to a manuscript. <I><FONT color=brown>Append</FONT></I> emphasizes that the addition is subordinate or minor in relation to the original work. Both words are formal, but <I><FONT color=brown>attach</FONT></I> has a legalistic ring to it lacking in <I><FONT color=brown>append</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>attach</FONT></I> a rider to a bill; to <I><FONT color=brown>append</FONT></I> a footnote. Note that <I><FONT color=brown>add</FONT></I> could be used in place of wither of these words, but would make the tone less formal and therefore less impressive.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Affix</FONT></B> means to fix or <I><FONT color=brown>attach</FONT></I> to: to <I><FONT color=brown>affix</FONT></I> a seal to a document. <I><FONT color=brown>Affix</FONT></I> is appropriate only in very formal contexts, as in the description of state affairs: The Govenor-General <I><FONT color=brown>affixed</FONT></I> his signature to the bill regulating assisted immigration.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Annex</FONT></B> means to add something as a supplement. It implies not only that the addition is a subordinate part, but often that the addition remains distinct: to <I><FONT color=brown>annex</FONT></I> an adjoining territory; to <I><FONT color=brown>annex</FONT></I> a building to an older one.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: abstract, deduct, <A href="entry://Lessen">LESSEN</A>, <A href="entry://Reduce">REDUCE</A>, subtract.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>addition</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>accessory</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>adjunct</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>appendage</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>appendix</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>appurtenance</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>attachment</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>supplement</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all refer to parts of a while, either integral or incidental. <B><FONT color=blue>Addition</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>supplement</FONT></B> share one sense in which the part and whole being joined are alike in kind, so that only an increase in quantity results. [The new members will be a welcome <I><FONT color=brown>addition</FONT></I> to the club; A vitamin supplement is not necessary for the average diet.] Both words have uses, on the other hand, in which the part remains distinguishable from and subordinate to the whole. [What a charming <I><FONT color=brown>addition</FONT></I> the sunroom makes to your house; The paper-covered book of quizzes was a <I><FONT color=brown>supplement</FONT></I> to the class’s mathematics textbook.] A <I><FONT color=brown>supplement</FONT></I> can also be a standard or special section of a newspaper: the Sunday <I><FONT color=brown>supplement</FONT></I> on the autumn fashions. <B><FONT color=blue>Appendix</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>supplement</FONT></I>, can refer to a part of a book, but is more often bound with the book itself. Neither of these are essential to the book’s completeness, although both would offer <I><FONT color=brown>additional</FONT></I> details on given material.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Appendage</FONT></B> refers to a more integral part of a whole than do any of the other terms. It is especially used in the life sciences to indicate the limbs or extremities of a plant or animal. No one except such a scientist, however, is likely ?even in the most formal of contexts ?to use <I><FONT color=brown>appendage</FONT></I> in preference to limb, branch, arm, leg, tail or whatever. Biologists themselves, in fact, can be every bit as exact and certainly more succinct in speaking of a monkey’s tail rather than its caudal <I><FONT color=brown>appendage</FONT></I>. In other uses of this word, the subordination of the part to the whole is emphasized. Such uses may be rather stiff except when a note of mockery is conveyed. [It was apparent to everyone that the husband had become a mere <I><FONT color=brown>appendage</FONT></I> to his wealthy wife.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Appurtenance</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>adjunct</FONT></B> both refer to a part that becomes a valuable addition to a whole, though not essential to it. <I><FONT color=brown>Appurtenance</FONT></I> has a specific legal sense of an incidental property right that goes together with a major right, such as the right of way to a building. The sense of a gratuitous advantage pervades its other meanings as well: He was unusual in considering her beauty as an <I><FONT color=brown>appurtenance</FONT></I> to her vigorous mind, and not vice versa. In adjunct, the separateness of the added part is stressed: Memorization is only an <I><FONT color=brown>adjunct</FONT></I> to real education, not its whole.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Attachment</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>accessory</FONT></B> refer to parts that are neither essential to nor fused with the whole they complement. An <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I> increases the usability of the original whole for which it is specifically designed, although its use is optional: If we had a flash-bulb <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I> we could also take pictures at night. One meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>accessory</FONT></I> is identical with that of <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I>, as in car <I><FONT color=brown>accessories</FONT></I>. Another sense of <I><FONT color=brown>accessory</FONT></I> points to its enhancing of the beauty, rather than the usefulness of the whole to which it is added: the tastefully chosen <I><FONT color=brown>accessories</FONT></I> that dramatize the simplest dress or suit.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Extraneous">EXTRANEOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: abstraction, deletion, omission, subtraction.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>adequate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>enough</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>satisfactory</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sufficient</FONT></B>:

<P>These words mean equal to what is required or expected, but not exceeding it by much. <B><FONT color=blue>Adequate</FONT></B> means suitable to the case or occasion: an <I><FONT color=brown>adequate</FONT></I> supply of food for the hike. Like <B><FONT color=blue>satisfactory</FONT></B>, <I><FONT color=brown>adequate</FONT></I> may apply to quality as well as quantity: an <I><FONT color=brown>adequate</FONT></I> performance, but nothing to rave about; His knowledge of French was <I><FONT color=brown>adequate</FONT></I> for the job, although he was not fluent in the language. <I><FONT color=brown>Satisfactory</FONT></I> implies a standard to which something is being compared or against which it is being tested. [The child’s reading ability was <I><FONT color=brown>satisfactory</FONT></I> for his age level; The response to our call for financial contributions was wholly <I><FONT color=brown>satisfactory</FONT></I>, exceeding our goal by several thousand dollars.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Enough</FONT></B> is in some contexts interchangeable with adequate, but is used only to indicate amount or degree, not quality. Moreover, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>adequate</FONT></I>, enough is not used after an article and before a noun in this sense. One can say <I><FONT color=brown>an adequate fuel</FONT></I> but not <I><FONT color=brown>an enough fuel</FONT></I>. (Note that <I><FONT color=brown>adequate fuel</FONT></I> can mean either <I><FONT color=brown>enough fuel</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fuel of acceptably high quality</FONT></I>, whereas an <I><FONT color=brown>adequate fuel</FONT></I> can refer only to quality.) <I><FONT color=brown>Enough</FONT></I> modifies either plural nouns or nouns denoting something that is measurable or of which there can be a quantity: <I><FONT color=brown>enough</FONT></I> salesmen; <I><FONT color=brown>enough</FONT></I> time; <I><FONT color=brown>enough</FONT></I> air ?but <B><FONT color=blue>not</FONT></B>: <I><FONT color=brown>enough</FONT></I> supply; <I><FONT color=brown>enough</FONT></I> house.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sufficient</FONT></B> implies a quantity or number <I><FONT color=brown>adequate</FONT></I> for a particular need or to fulfil a particular purpose: Our military response to the aggressive act was limited but <I><FONT color=brown>sufficient</FONT></I> to show our determination. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>satisfactory</FONT></I>, it does not imply measuring up to a standard. It emphasizes instead the end being sought; the degree to which something contributes to the achievement of that end is what makes it <I><FONT color=brown>sufficient</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>insufficient</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Prevalent">PLENTIFUL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deficient">DEFICIENT</A>, inadequate, insufficient, unqualified, unsuitable.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Advice</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>counsel</FONT></B> mean an opinion or a judgement given by one person to another urging him either to do something or not to do it. <I><FONT color=brown>Advice</FONT></I>, the more general term, may be given on serious matter or relatively trivial ones, but <I><FONT color=brown>counsel</FONT></I> suggests solemn <I><FONT color=brown>advice</FONT></I> given in an official or authoritative capacity about a matter of some importance, at least to the person seeking it: to give <I><FONT color=brown>advice</FONT></I> to one’s son on the choice of a career; a woman seeking <I><FONT color=brown>advice</FONT></I> on hair styling; a young resident who profited from the <I><FONT color=brown>counsel</FONT></I> of an experienced surgeon. <I><FONT color=brown>Advice</FONT></I>, unless qualified by an adjective suggesting otherwise, often implies that the <I><FONT color=brown>adviser</FONT></I> has a direct and more or less personal interest in the person <I><FONT color=brown>advised</FONT></I>; the subject of <I><FONT color=brown>advice</FONT></I> is thus often personal in nature. <I><FONT color=brown>Counsel</FONT></I>, on the other hand, suggests a detached, impersonal view on the part of the person giving it; and the subject of <I><FONT color=brown>counsel</FONT></I> is often of a business nature.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Recommendation</FONT></B>, in this sense, suggests <I><FONT color=brown>advice</FONT></I> given on the basis of one’s own experience, and expresses a stronger, more positive endorsement of a particular course than <I><FONT color=brown>advice</FONT></I>. One’s <I><FONT color=brown>advice</FONT></I> may be to choose the lesser of two evils; a <I><FONT color=brown>recommendation</FONT></I> implies that one course is distinctly favourable and ought to be purused on its own merits: to read a new book on the <I><FONT color=brown>recommendation</FONT></I> of a friend.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Help">HELP</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Afraid</FONT></B> means showing fear. When used by itself, no particular degree of fear is indicated. [She’s <I><FONT color=brown>afraid</FONT></I> of dogs, even of puppies; We are <I><FONT color=brown>afraid</FONT></I> to walk in the park at night since the woman was killed there.] In most uses, being <I><FONT color=brown>afraid</FONT></I> is personal, and the fear has to do with bodily harm. <I><FONT color=brown>Afraid</FONT></I> is also used in polite discourse to indicate nothing more than mild concern: I’m <I><FONT color=brown>afraid</FONT></I> I’m a bit late for my appointment. Sometimes this use conceals great fear: If our present policy is continued, I am <I><FONT color=brown>afraid</FONT></I> that war is inevitable.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Frightened</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scared</FONT></B> often suggest fear of bodily harm, but not invariably; both may be used to describe vague fears of unknown source. [When the lights went out I got <I><FONT color=brown>scared</FONT></I>; She’s always <I><FONT color=brown>frightened</FONT></I> when she’s alone in the house.] <I><FONT color=brown>Frightened</FONT></I> has a more genteel sound than <I><FONT color=brown>scared</FONT></I>, but both apply strictly to physical felt fear, even if the causes are emotional or imaginary.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Anxious</FONT></B> means tense and worried. <B><FONT color=blue>Fearful</FONT></B> may mean full of terror or dread, but often means merely <B><FONT color=blue>apprehensive</FONT></B> ?that is, anticipating danger, failure or trouble. In the latter sense, fearful shares with <I><FONT color=brown>anxious</FONT></I> the suggestion that the worry stems from inner concern without much relevance to external conditions, and is in this sense unreasonable. <I><FONT color=brown>Apprehensive</FONT></I> suggests awareness of impending danger caused by circumstances, and does not depend so much on one’s peculiar nature or habitual state of mind. [She was <I><FONT color=brown>anxious</FONT></I> about her daughter being out so late at night; The playwright was <I><FONT color=brown>fearful</FONT></I> that his first opening would be a failure; an investor who was <I><FONT color=brown>apprehensive</FONT></I> about his holdings during the recession; We are frankly <I><FONT color=brown>fearful</FONT></I> of another depression unless the economy improves radically in the next few months.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Aghast</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>alarmed</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>terror-stricken</FONT></B> are applied to strong feelings of fear or fright. <I><FONT color=brown>Aghast</FONT></I> means <I><FONT color=brown>afraid</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>frightened</FONT></I> to the point of shock. A man waking up in a burning house will be <I><FONT color=brown>aghast</FONT></I> at the thought that his family may be in grave danger. <I><FONT color=brown>Alarmed</FONT></I> means suddenly and sharply <I><FONT color=brown>afraid</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>frightened</FONT></I>. Parents will be alarmed by a sudden outbreak of polio in their community. <I><FONT color=brown>Terror-stricken</FONT></I> is the strongest word in this list, and suggests fear to strong that normal reactions are suppressed. A <I><FONT color=brown>terror-stricken</FONT></I> person who is drowning may in panic resist the efforts of someone who is trying to save him.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Frighten">FRIGHTEN</A>, <A href="entry://Intimidate">INTIMIDATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: audacious, <A href="entry://Brave">BRAVE</A>, calm, confident, unafraid.</P>

agency
<B><FONT color=blue>means</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>agency</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>instrumentality</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>medium</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to anything serving or used to accomplish a purpose. <B><FONT color=blue>Means</FONT></B> is the most general word. In a concrete sense, it points to a device or contrivance used to carry out an action or perform an operation. [A hammer is a <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> of driving a nail; A taxi was his <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> of getting to the theatre.] In a broader, abstract sense, it refers to method, system or technique: the <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> by which a politician may extend his power. [The harnessing of falling water is a <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> of generating electricity; Statistical analysis is a means of arriving at a fairly reliable forecast.] Ways and <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> are methods of accomplishing an end, and this phrase is sometimes specifically directed to governmental finance and fund raising: the chairman of the Committee of Ways and <I><FONT color=brown>Means</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Means</FONT></I> may also be applied to persons and things considered in terms of their past, present for potential usefulness. [He is the <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> of our achieving victory; art for art’s sake as opposed to art as a <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> of spreading propaganda.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agency</FONT></B> suggests causation and implies active intervention. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I>, it would not be used of a passive tool employed by others in their action. Instead, it indicates a force, operation or process that on its own produces a certain effect. [Carbon dioxide is converted into oxygen through the <I><FONT color=brown>agency</FONT></I> of plants; Corruption in government was exposed through the <I><FONT color=brown>agency</FONT></I> of the press.] Applied to persons, <I><FONT color=brown>agency</FONT></I> often indicates a deliberate working or acting on behalf of others: The dispute was resolved through the <I><FONT color=brown>agency</FONT></I> of mediators. An advertising <I><FONT color=brown>agency</FONT></I>, employment <I><FONT color=brown>agency</FONT></I> or travel agency is a business that serves clients, acting in their interests and helping them attain their goals.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Instrumentality</FONT></B> is much more formal than the foregoing but is close to <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> in scope. It focuses on the instrument acting or being used to accomplish someone’s purpose. [through the <I><FONT color=brown>instrumentality</FONT></I> of a travellers?aid society, the lost boy was found and returned to his parents.]</P><P>The term <B><FONT color=blue>medium</FONT></B> has the greatest number of specific senses that relate to the overall concept of means ?all stressing the intermediate position of the <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I>. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>agency</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> may refer to an intervening substance through which a force may act or in which an effect may be produced. [Copper is a good <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> for the conduction of heat and electricity; Air is a <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> of sound.] <I><FONT color=brown>Medium</FONT></I> may also designate a <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I>, technique or vehicle of expression, or the material used for such expression. [For her, poetry was a congenial <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I>; a sculptor whose favourite <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> is stone.] In a spiritualistic sense, the word <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> denotes a sensitive person, often a woman, who goes into a trance so that spirits may supposedly speak through her, using her as an intermediary for communication with the living. Opposed to this passive mediumship are other senses of the word that refer to a more active intermediary. Here, most commonly, <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> is applied to modern channels of communication, often appearing in its plural form <I><FONT color=brown>media</FONT></I>. Radio, television, newspapers and magazines are known as the mass <I><FONT color=brown>media</FONT></I>. Television is an advertising, entertainment and news <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I>. A modern communications <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> in itself ?the means, techniques and effects of transmission ?may seem to some more interesting and influential than the material or message the <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> conveys. In this case, it is no longer a <I><FONT color=brown>medium</FONT></I> in the strict sense of the word, but an end in itself.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Implement">IMPLEMENT</A>, <A href="entry://Method">METHOD</A>, <A href="entry://Performer">PERFORMER</A>, <A href="entry://Representative">REPRESENTATIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Wealth">WEALTH</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>aggression</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>assault</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>attack</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>offensive</FONT></B>:

<P>All these words refer to actions initiated against other persons or groups, especially in wars. <B><FONT color=blue>Aggression</FONT></B> means unprovoked belligerent action, as by one nation upon the territory of another. An <B><FONT color=blue>attack</FONT></B> is aimed at injuring or destroying others, often by catching them off guard and unprepared. An <B><FONT color=blue>assault</FONT></B> is a violent <I><FONT color=brown>attack</FONT></I>, so violent that it often implies personal abuse motivated by envy, malice and the like. Both <I><FONT color=brown>attack</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>assault</FONT></I> can be applied to any violent conflict, verbal as well as physical: a personal <I><FONT color=brown>assault</FONT></I> on the character of the chairman; a vigorous <I><FONT color=brown>attack</FONT></I> on the fiscal policy of the present government. [We will continue to resist <I><FONT color=brown>aggression</FONT></I> because tyranny must be resisted; The <I><FONT color=brown>attack</FONT></I> came just before dawn; The final <I><FONT color=brown>assaults</FONT></I> were designed to clear the last remnants of enemy resistance.] <I><FONT color=brown>Aggression</FONT></I>, as the above example illustrates, is now widely used among diplomats to describe a variety of actions contrary or hostile to the interests of their own countries; <I><FONT color=brown>aggression</FONT></I> is thus a linguistic casualty of the cold war, and has lost much of its meaning. <I><FONT color=brown>Assault</FONT></I> suggests ?perhaps more than <I><FONT color=brown>attack</FONT></I> ?the element of suddenness and surprise, as evidenced by the expression "<I><FONT color=brown>surprise attack</FONT></I>"; such emphasis is unnecessary with <I><FONT color=brown>assault</FONT></I>. In psychoanalytic usage <I><FONT color=brown>aggression</FONT></I> is a tendency towards hostile action. This sense has led to a number of analogous popular usages: He’s just taking out his <I><FONT color=brown>aggressions</FONT></I> on me!</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>offensive</FONT></B> is a movement or position of offence or <I><FONT color=brown>attack</FONT></I>. In some contexts it is interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>attack</FONT></I>, but in others it applies to a large-scale co-ordinated military campaign of men and matériel: a major new <I><FONT color=brown>offensive</FONT></I> was launched in the western front. In recent diplomatic language, <I><FONT color=brown>offensive</FONT></I> is sometimes used synonymously with initiative: a peace <I><FONT color=brown>offensive</FONT></I> in the form of a three-point offer to negotiate an end to the war.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Attack">ATTACK</A>, <A href="entry://Fight">FIGHT</A>.</P><P>ANYONYMS: defence, repulsion, retreat, surrender, withdrawal.</P>

aggressive
<B><FONT color=blue>bold</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>aggressive</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>forward</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pushing</FONT></B>:

<P>These words share the connotation of self-assertive, confident and energetic dispositions, with or without a disregard for the rights of others. <B><FONT color=blue>Bold</FONT></B> shares with <B><FONT color=blue>aggressive</FONT></B> the implication of a vigorous attack on a problem or prosecution of one’s aims, and in this sense carries no derogatory connotation. An <I><FONT color=brown>aggressive</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>bold</FONT></I> entrepreneur will seek success farther afield and will risk more in this search than will his more timid competitor. <I><FONT color=brown>Bold</FONT></I> does, however, have a wider ranges of application than <I><FONT color=brown>aggressive</FONT></I>.

<B><FONT color=blue>alcoholic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>boozer</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>dipsomaniac</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>drunk</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>drunkard</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inebriate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>soak</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sot</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>tippler</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>wino</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a person who habitually drinks alcoholic beverages to excess. <B><FONT color=blue>Alcoholic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>drunkard</FONT></B> are the most general of these, the first being the more formal and neutral of the two: <I><FONT color=brown>Drunkard</FONT></I> carries a tone of condemnation and can apply justly only to someone who frequently drinks past the point of sobriety: Anyone can see he’s a common <I><FONT color=brown>drunkard</FONT></I> the way he staggers home night after night. <I><FONT color=brown>Alcoholic</FONT></I> was at one time simply a medical description for someone who could not moderated his intake after the first drink. It has since become so popular as a general term that it appears often in informal contexts as well. Even informally the word lacks the tone of disapproval implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>drunkard</FONT></I>. It should be noted, however, that an <I><FONT color=brown>alcoholic</FONT></I>, unlike a <I><FONT color=brown>drunkard</FONT></I>, may have abstained from alcohol completely for years: He used to be a <I><FONT color=brown>drunkard</FONT></I>, but now he refuses drinks at parties by saying , "Sorry, but I’m an <I><FONT color=brown>alcoholic</FONT></I>."</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inebriate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dipsomaniac</FONT></B> are technical terms to describe an excessive drinker, but <I><FONT color=brown>alcoholic</FONT></I> has so widely displaced them that both terms now seem antiquated or fusty. An <I><FONT color=brown>inebriate</FONT></I>, strictly speaking, is a person who is intoxicated at the moment of being described. <I><FONT color=brown>Dipsomaniac</FONT></I> , once the word for a chronic <I><FONT color=brown>alcoholic</FONT></I> (one whose steady intake does not disrupt his living patterns), now might be primarily jocose.</P><P>The rest of these words are either extremely informal or slang. A <B><FONT color=blue>boozer</FONT></B> might denote an acute <I><FONT color=brown>alcoholic</FONT></I>, one who alternates between periods of sobriety and intoxication in a pattern disruptive of his normal life. On the other hand, <I><FONT color=brown>boozer</FONT></I> can be used almost admiringly to describe a person who drinks a great deal without losing control of himself. [He was the most unbelievable <I><FONT color=brown>boozer</FONT></I> I ever saw; he could down six straight whiskies and never bat an eye.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Drunk</FONT></B> is, of course, a shortening of <I><FONT color=brown>drunkard</FONT></I>, having greater informality than the latter and a tone of even greater contempt. A sot is one who is drunk most of the time, as is a soak.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tippler</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wino</FONT></B> both refer to specific kinds of drinkers. A <I><FONT color=brown>tippler</FONT></I> drinks small amounts at frequent intervals over long periods of time. The word is often used for the secret or private drinker: No one would have guessed that the headmistress was a <I><FONT color=brown>tippler</FONT></I> except the man who carried away the empty bottles. <I><FONT color=brown>Wino</FONT></I> is usually applied to a tramp or derelict whose addiction to <I><FONT color=brown>alcohol</FONT></I> is satisfied by drinking inexpensive fortified wines. It is also used for any heavy drinker whose intake is primarily of wine.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: abstainer, non-drinker, teetotaller.</P>

alibi
<B><FONT color=blue>excuse</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>alibi</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>apologia</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>apology</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are comparable when they refer to causes, circumstances or motivations which are put forth in order to defend, explain or extenuate an action, viewpoint or the like. An <B><FONT color=blue>excuse</FONT></B> is an implicit admission of wrong, but it is offered as a full or partial justification of one’s actions. By contrast, an <B><FONT color=blue>apology</FONT></B>, in current usage, is an open admission that one has done wrong and is sorry for it. Whereas an <I><FONT color=brown>excuse</FONT></I> is a means of avoiding or mitigating the responsibility for one’s actions, an <I><FONT color=brown>apology</FONT></I> is the contrite recognition of that responsibility. [His <I><FONT color=brown>excuse</FONT></I> for being late was that his train was delayed; He could only offer a frank <I><FONT color=brown>apology</FONT></I> for having forgotten about our dinner engagement.]</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Apology</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>apologia</FONT></B> both originally implied the intent of clearly setting forth the grounds for some action, conviction or the like, which others consider wrong or improper. <I><FONT color=brown>Apology</FONT></I> is now seldom used in this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>apologia</FONT></I> being preferred. [The purged Communist stoutly defended his revolutionary zeal and wrote a lengthy <I><FONT color=brown>apologia</FONT></I> in explanation of his allegedly counter-revolutionary ideas.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Alibi</FONT></B>, in common usage, implies that an <I><FONT color=brown>excuse</FONT></I> is plausible rather than true. In legal use, however, the word means a plea by an accused person that he was elsewhere when the crime was committed. Even in other contexts, <I><FONT color=brown>alibi</FONT></I> does not invariably suggest dubiety. [His <I><FONT color=brown>alibi</FONT></I> depended upon the eyewitness testimony of a taxi driver; a desperate, last-minute <I><FONT color=brown>alibi</FONT></I> intended to save him from the wrath of his father.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Explanation">EXPLANATION</A>, <A href="entry://Reasoning">REASONING</A>.</P>

allegiance
<B><FONT color=blue>allegiance</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fealty</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fidelity</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>loyalty</FONT></B>:

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Allegiance</FONT></B> refers to the obligation of faithfulness, i.e., of <B><FONT color=blue>fidelity</FONT></B>, that a citizen owes his country or his sovereign in return for the benefits and privileges he receives by virtue of his citizenship. <I><FONT color=brown>Allegiance</FONT></I> is now widely used to refer to any similar obligation a person feels, as to a principle or a political leader. [In the Declaration of Independence, the American colonists renounced their <I><FONT color=brown>allegiance</FONT></I> to the British Crown; a lasting <I><FONT color=brown>allegiance</FONT></I> to this political party.] <B><FONT color=blue>Fealty</FONT></B> is used specifically of the feudal obligation a vassal owed his lord. The oath of <I><FONT color=brown>fealty</FONT></I> expressed both <I><FONT color=brown>allegiance</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fidelity</FONT></I>.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Fidelity</FONT></I> implies a strong and faithful dedication; His <I><FONT color=brown>fidelity</FONT></I> to the principles of justice never wavered. <B><FONT color=blue>Loyalty</FONT></B> is more often associated with personal relationships than is <I><FONT color=brown>fidelity</FONT></I>. Where <I><FONT color=brown>fidelity</FONT></I> suggests adherence, <I><FONT color=brown>loyalty</FONT></I> points to devotion. It emphasizes a profoundly personal commitment.

allegory
<B><FONT color=blue>allegory</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>parable</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all denote a story told about fictional persons and events to teach or illustrate a moral principle. In an <B><FONT color=blue>allegory</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>parable</FONT></B> the moral is not stated, but is left to the hearer to discover. An <I><FONT color=brown>allegory</FONT></I> is usually long and elaborate, with many characters and incidents; a <I><FONT color=brown>parable</FONT></I> is brief, and typically shows the application of a moral precept to a familiar situation. A <B><FONT color=blue>fable</FONT></B> usually states the moral at the end, and is told in terms of animals that speak and reflect the nature of human beings. [Dante’s Divine Comedy is an <I><FONT color=brown>allegory</FONT></I> based on the struggle between the city-states of what is now Italy; The <I><FONT color=brown>fable</FONT></I> of the tortoise and the hare drives home the moral that steady, persistent application is more rewarding in the end than arrogant, unstable brilliance; The <I><FONT color=brown>parables</FONT></I> of the New Testament make abstract moral principles concrete and vivid.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Narrative">NARRATIVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable when applied to persons who are, or seem to be, emotionally distant from others. <B><FONT color=blue>Aloof</FONT></B> is applied to persons who are distant in manner or interest, as from a reluctance to associate with those whom they regard as intellectual or social inferiors, or because of habitual shyness or idiosyncrasy. [She held herself <I><FONT color=brown>aloof</FONT></I> from society, preferring to spend her days and nights dwelling on her memories; She always affected a grand, <I><FONT color=brown>aloof</FONT></I> manner with us poor middle-class people who work for a living.] <B><FONT color=blue>Detached</FONT></B> means free from emotional or intellectual involvement, and often suggests the neutral attitude of the impartial observer: the doctor’s <I><FONT color=brown>detached</FONT></I> approach to pain. <I><FONT color=brown>Detached</FONT></I> may also mean inwardly distracted, emotionally untouchable. [He always seems so <I><FONT color=brown>detached</FONT></I> about everything; you just can’t reach him at all.] <B><FONT color=blue>Reserved</FONT></B> implies reluctance to express one’s feelings or thoughts. Where <I><FONT color=brown>reserved</FONT></I> emphasizes manner, <I><FONT color=brown>detached</FONT></I> stresses attitude. Both <I><FONT color=brown>reserved</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>detached</FONT></I> can be associated with attractive qualities, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>aloof</FONT></I> is seldom so considered. [He was a diffident, scholarly fellow with a <I><FONT color=brown>reserved</FONT></I> but genial manner; He looked about him with a very <I><FONT color=brown>detached</FONT></I> air, and announced to no one in particular that he was about to be sick.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Distant">DISTANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: communicative, <A href="entry://Gregarious">GREGARIOUS</A>, neighbourly, sociable, <A href="entry://Talkative">TALKATIVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words are applied to a person who has some knowledge or proficiency in a certain area, but who is not an expert. <B><FONT color=blue>Amateur</FONT></B> usually means a person who pursues an interest, study or skill as a hobby or avocation rather than as a profession. Thus, a doctor who plays the violin in his spare time is an <I><FONT color=brown>amateur</FONT></I> in music, even if his playing is skilful. However, the word is sometimes used disparagingly to stress that a person’s skill, being non-professional, is not as good as it could be.

The word has in recent years, however, come to be associated with frivolousness and shallowness. A <I><FONT color=brown>dilettante</FONT></I> is a person who, though he shows interest in a field of knowledge or in an artistic skill, pursues it chiefly for enjoyment or ostentation, thus never attaining more than a superficial knowledge of it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dabbler</FONT></B> is an even more disparaging term than <I><FONT color=brown>dilettante</FONT></I> and denotes a person who merely dips into something without serious intent or perseverance.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: connoisseur, expert, professional, specialist.</P>

<P>These words all refer either to a general distrust of centralized government or to specific ideologies and their techniques for deliberately disrupting the fabric of an existing society in order to gain a stated set of goals.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Anarchism</FONT></B> has both philosophical and historical senses. In a philosophic framework, <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I> refers to a tendency that sees individual freedom threatened by any trend towards collectivism in government: Thoreau’s very personal <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I> stemmed from an absolute dislike for all institutions in general. Most specifically, the word refers to a historical movement of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> and 20<SUP>th</SUP> centuries that held all existing societies to be corrupt and proposed to destroy them. Some strains of <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I> proposed single acts of symbolic, pointless violence, which gave rise in the popular imagination of the 1890s to the figure of the bearded, bomb-throwing <I><FONT color=brown>anarchist</FONT></I>. One strain of militant <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I> was called <B><FONT color=blue>Bajuninism</FONT></B> after the Russian theorist who deeply influenced the development of Marxism. Another strain, known as <B><FONT color=blue>syndicalism</FONT></B>, foresaw a world-wide shut-down of industry by workers in order to cause the collapse of capitalism. After this "general strike," comparable to the world-wide revolution foreseen by Marx, workers would govern society directly through the trade-union structure. [The Industrial Workers of the World, known as Wobblies, were a curious group who sometimes appeared to advocate <I><FONT color=brown>syndicalism</FONT></I>, sometimes merely isolated acts of violent <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I>, and sometimes a systematic socialism.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pacifism</FONT></B> is a strain of <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I> sharply distinguished from others by its total disavowal of violence. Often called <I><FONT color=brown>pacifist</FONT></I> <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I>, it applies especially, but not exclusively, to those who wish to abolish war and who agitate against any military solution of international problems. Mahatma Gandhi, an adherent of <I><FONT color=brown>pacifism</FONT></I> and admittedly inspired by Thoreau’s philosophical <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I>, founded <B><FONT color=blue>Gandhism</FONT></B> (or satyagraha), a specific method of civil disobedience that successfully used non-violent techniques to free India of British rule.</P><P>Civil rights workers in America, agitating against the segregation of Negroes, at first deliberately adopted philosophical <I><FONT color=brown>anarchism</FONT></I> and the techniques of <I><FONT color=brown>pacifism</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>Gandhism</FONT></I> to win their goals. The phrase first used to describe this fusion of theory and method was passive resistance, but unwanted overtones in the phrase, implying helpless passivity, caused it to be rejected in favour of non-violence, a word now used by <I><FONT color=brown>pacifists</FONT></I>, non-violent <I><FONT color=brown>anarchists</FONT></I>, and integrationists alike to describe their methods. Non-violence implies active resistance to an unjust law or custom by such acts as demonstrations, boycotts and disruptions of the normal functioning of society.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lawlessness">LAWLESSNESS</A>, <A href="entry://Socialism">SOCIALISM</A>.</P>

<P>The words in this list are very close in meaning, each being most strictly applied to a person from whom one is descended. <B><FONT color=blue>Ancestor</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>forbear</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>forefather</FONT></B> are hardly ever applied to parents or grandparents, whereas <B><FONT color=blue>progenitor</FONT></B> is sometimes applied to them as well as to more remote <I><FONT color=brown>ancestors</FONT></I>. [Although Napoleon and his immediate <I><FONT color=brown>progenitors</FONT></I> were Corsicans, he is considered by most modern Frenchmen to have been as French as their own <I><FONT color=brown>ancestors</FONT></I>.]</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Ancestor</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>progenitor</FONT></I> are often applied to things other than people. [Eohippus is an <I><FONT color=brown>ancestor</FONT></I> of the horse; The <I><FONT color=brown>progenitors</FONT></I> of Italian lyric verse forms were those used by the troubadours of Provence.] <I><FONT color=brown>Progenitor</FONT></I>, in this sense, points to an early form that created, caused or led to the development of a newer one; <I><FONT color=brown>ancestor</FONT></I>, even in this extended sense, retains the idea of historical evolution, the course of which is determined by forces over which man has no control and little knowledge. [The impressionist movement was one of the <I><FONT color=brown>ancestors</FONT></I> of abstract art; Johnson’s dictionary was the <I><FONT color=brown>progenitor</FONT></I> of many others that followed its style and treatment of the language.]</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Forefather</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>forbear</FONT></I> are usually used in the plural. <I><FONT color=brown>Forefathers</FONT></I> is most often used in a poetical context and frequently connotes strong family or racial feeling, or continuing habitation in one place, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>forbears</FONT></I> has such connotations to a much smaller degree.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Descent">DESCENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: descendant, offspring, progeny.</P>

This meaning is particularly used by psychiatrists to refer to patients who are immobilized by such a feeling without being able to explain what it is they fear: The boy had been so mistreated that he faced each day with a vast, uncomprehending <I><FONT color=brown>anxiety</FONT></I>.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Anxiety</FONT></I> also relates, on the other hand, to words of this group that are not necessarily tied to fear of the future. Existential philosophers developed this meaning to refer to the helpless, all-encompassing frustration of the human condition when confronted with the inexplicability of life. Recently this kind of <I><FONT color=brown>anxiety</FONT></I> is often referred to by the word <B><FONT color=blue>angst</FONT></B>, from the Danish of the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard: In the Age of <I><FONT color=brown>Anxiety</FONT></I>, W.H.Auden claims that our fear of the future is really a fear of ourselves and our own irrepressible.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dread</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>apprehension</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>foreboding</FONT></B> emphasize the fear of something that has yet to happen. <I><FONT color=brown>Dread</FONT></I> is the most intense of any of the words listed here, with overtones of helplessness in the face of something as inevitable as it is terrible. The thing <I><FONT color=brown>dreaded</FONT></I> may be a specific occurrence or a less well-defined evil that is none the less terrifying to consider. [During the international crisis everyone was filled with the <I><FONT color=brown>dread</FONT></I> of nuclear war; She did not know what to expect on the dark road ahead, but every shadow filled her with <I><FONT color=brown>dread</FONT></I>.] The word can, of course, be used hyperbolically for more trivial occasions: I <I><FONT color=brown>dread</FONT></I> the rush-hour traffic so much that I often avoid it by coming late to work. <I><FONT color=brown>Apprehension</FONT></I> is more formal than either <I><FONT color=brown>dread</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>anxiety</FONT></I>, less intense in feeling, and applies to vaguer fears of a future happening. It is not so much a harmful inevitability that is foreseen as an uncertain outcome that keeps one in suspense: No matter how perfect the weather, she never conquered the <I><FONT color=brown>apprehension</FONT></I> with which she saw him off at the airport. Like <I><FONT color=brown>anxiety</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>foreboding</FONT></I> is midway between <I><FONT color=brown>dread</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>apprehension</FONT></I> in it formality, its intensity and its conviction of certain or possible harm. What sets this word aside is its aura of superstition: Because it rained on her wedding day, she spent the rest of the week in gloomy <I><FONT color=brown>foreboding</FONT></I>. The word can be used without this overtone in which case it points to a more general nagging doubt about the future: He carried his report home with a sharp <I><FONT color=brown>foreboding</FONT></I> of the nasty scene he would face that evening.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Worry</FONT></B> is far less formal than the previous words and implies an obsessive concern for far more mundane matters. It frequently appears in the plural. [Forget your <I><FONT color=brown>worries</FONT></I> and relax.] It is often used as an abstraction for a habit of mind that compulsively frets about the future without real result: <I><FONT color=brown>Worry</FONT></I> never makes up for what hard work could have accomplished.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Misgiving</FONT></B> is doubt about the outcome of an action, or a feeling of <I><FONT color=brown>apprehension</FONT></I> provoked by such doubt: He had some <I><FONT color=brown>misgivings</FONT></I> about investing in the stock, and when he saw the company’s annual report he knew at once they were justified. <B><FONT color=blue>Uneasiness</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>disquiet</FONT></B>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>misgiving</FONT></I>, do not necessarily apply to fear about the future. Both suggest that actual physical discomfort or restlessness accompanies the <I><FONT color=brown>apprehensive</FONT></I> or fearful state, <I><FONT color=brown>uneasiness</FONT></I> most strongly so. <I><FONT color=brown>Disquiet</FONT></I> refers to a more subtle <I><FONT color=brown>uneasiness</FONT></I> over an often ill-defined danger. [What had at first been merely a faint <I><FONT color=brown>disquiet</FONT></I> as the minutes passed became at last outright <I><FONT color=brown>uneasiness</FONT></I> that set him to pacing about the hospital’s waiting room.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Afraid">AFRAID</A>, <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>.</P><P>ANYONYMS: assurance, calmness, composure, <A href="entry://Confidence">CONFIDENCE</A>, ease, equability, equanimity, nonchalance, placidity, quietude, security.</P>

<P>These words refer to a psychological trait that involves a conviction of one’s own worth or an unselfconscious certainty of succeeding at whatever is attempted, unhampered by doubt, hesitation or fear. <B><FONT color=blue>Confidence</FONT></B> stresses a general optimism that all is or will be well: able to face the future with confidence. The word may suggest fearless trust, whether well- or ill-advised: talking to the unsavoury people in the bar with effortless <I><FONT color=brown>confidence</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Self-confidence</FONT></B> restricts these possibilities to a general optimism concerning one’s own capacities and accomplishment, suggesting a complete absence of timidity and, less positively, an aggressive bearing: social clubs set up to promote <I><FONT color=brown>self-confidence</FONT></I> in teenagers; a garish costume that matched the <I><FONT color=brown>self-confidence</FONT></I> with which she ploughed her way through the startled guests.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Aplomb</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>self-possession</FONT></B> stress the ability to keep oneself under firm control. <I><FONT color=brown>Self-possession</FONT></I> suggests the restraining of conflicting impulses or the brushing aside of distractions, accompanied by a cool unemotional approach even in trying situations: calmly working her way through the customs inspection with unflustered <I><FONT color=brown>self-possession</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Aplomb</FONT></I>, by contrast, emphasizes a total lack of self-doubt and may suggest a carefree or uncritical exuberance: Although he had never duelled before, he faced his opponent with <I><FONT color=brown>aplomb</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Poise</FONT></B> stresses steadiness and balance and, somewhat like <I><FONT color=brown>self-possession</FONT></I>, suggests a calm sureness of manner able to cope courteously with any contingency: a shy and awkward adolescent who had turned overnight into a young woman amply endowed with grace and <I><FONT color=brown>poise</FONT></I>. With its emphasis on a mastery of social properties, <B><FONT color=blue>savoir faire</FONT></B> relates closely to poise in stressing an intuitive ability to do the right thing socially and to get on well with other people whatever the situation: a <I><FONT color=brown>savoir faire</FONT></I> that never deserted him whether he found himself among first-nighters at the opera or among the bare-footed habitués of a bohemian coffee shop.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Self-assurance</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>smugness</FONT></B> stress an extreme conviction of one’s own worth, ability or superiority. <I><FONT color=brown>Self-assurance</FONT></I> can be used either positively or negatively, but <I><FONT color=brown>smugness</FONT></I> is exclusively disapproving: an astonishing <I><FONT color=brown>self-assurance</FONT></I> in whizzing through an exam for which he had spent only a few hours preparing; insisting with unblushing <I><FONT color=brown>self-assurance</FONT></I> that even the stupidest native would understand her English if only she spoke loudly and clearly enough. <I><FONT color=brown>Smugness</FONT></I> suggests an uncritical vanity or pride in one’s own privileged position and a failure to see things from other people’s point of view. This puts it in strong contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>savoir faire</FONT></I> which stresses a sensing of what people will find pleasant and apt: the <I><FONT color=brown>smugness</FONT></I> with which she chose to stay at the most expensive hotels to avoid rubbing shoulders with the "hoi polloi." <B><FONT color=blue>Cockiness</FONT></B> is an informal term for complete confidence in oneself. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>self-assurance</FONT></I>, the word carries some pejorative connotations and the attitude that it describes is much more in evidence than <I><FONT color=brown>smugness</FONT></I>: His <I><FONT color=brown>cockiness</FONT></I> about his athletic prowess knew no bounds.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Egoism">EGOISM</A>, <A href="entry://Jaunty">JAUNTY</A>, <A href="entry://Overbearing">OVERBEARING</A>, <A href="entry://Zest">ZEST</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>, diffidence, <A href="entry://Doubt">DOUBT</A>, hesitation, shyness, timidity.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>applause</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>acclaim</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>acclamation</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>plaudit</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to simultaneous expressions of approval or praise by a number of persons. <B><FONT color=blue>Applause</FONT></B> may be given by voice or by clapping the hands. The word does not suggest any particular degree of enthusiasm, and depends on context or qualifying adjectives to indicate the intensity or sincerity of the approval. [At the end of the concert, the pianist was greeted with a smattering of <I><FONT color=brown>applause</FONT></I>.] <B><FONT color=blue>Acclaim</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>acclamation</FONT></B> are more formal terms, and refer specifically to vocal expressions of praise or approval. In parliamentary bodies, a measure adopted by <I><FONT color=brown>acclamation</FONT></I> is one adopted by shouts of approval and <I><FONT color=brown>applause</FONT></I> rather than by individual votes; by <I><FONT color=brown>acclamation</FONT></I> can therefore be taken to mean by enthusiastic endorsement of the assembly. <I><FONT color=brown>Acclaim</FONT></I> need not refer particularly to actual cries of approval, but is perhaps more commonly used nowadays to express figurative <I><FONT color=brown>applause</FONT></I>: Einstein’s achievements earned him the <I><FONT color=brown>acclaim</FONT></I> of the entire scientific community. <B><FONT color=blue>Plaudit</FONT></B>, also a formal term, means a burst of <I><FONT color=brown>applause</FONT></I>, but, like <I><FONT color=brown>acclaim</FONT></I>, is often used figuratively, commonly in the plural: to receive the <I><FONT color=brown>plaudits</FONT></I> of one’s fellow musicians for an outstanding performance.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Approval">APPROVAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: abuse, booing, censure, disapprobation, disapproval, execration, hissing, jeering, obloquy, reproof, vituperation.</P>

appoint
<B><FONT color=blue>appoint</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>assign</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>designate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>name</FONT></B>:

<P>The situation that unites these words is one in which a person is being chosen to fulfil a given function by someone else. Unlike other ways of matching people to tasks, these words imply an official situation ?in an office, club or government ?in which the choice is made by means other than an elective process. <B><FONT color=blue>Appoint</FONT></B> indicates that the selection is made by someone officially charged with this duty, although the actual selection itself may be arbitrary or judicious: Members of Parliament are elected by the people, while public officials are <I><FONT color=brown>appointed</FONT></I> by the Crown. Of this set <B><FONT color=blue>name</FONT></B> is the most informal and tells least about the chooser or the method of choice adopted: Since no one has volunteered, I hereby <I><FONT color=brown>name</FONT></I> the following to serve on the entertainment committee. Thus the word sometimes stresses outcome rather than process: a judge <I><FONT color=brown>named</FONT></I> as a party to the decision.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Designate</FONT></B> is the most formal of all these terms, even to the point of stiffness. It can be useful to distinguish from appoint a process of selection that is only quasi-official in nature: The new manager <I><FONT color=brown>designated</FONT></I> as his secretary the girl who had been head of the typing pool.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Assign</FONT></B> differs from the other words here in that it most often refers, not to the picking of a person for a task, but to the delegation of a task to one or more members of a group. It has a overtone, not invariably present, of arbitrariness, possibly a resentment of having no say in what has been <I><FONT color=brown>assigned</FONT></I> to us. It is occasionally used of people rather than of the task, in this case, the person being <I><FONT color=brown>assigned</FONT></I> usually joins others already designated in a common task: Jones is <I><FONT color=brown>assigned</FONT></I> to mess duty, Smith is <I><FONT color=brown>assigned</FONT></I> to guard duty, and Anderson is <I><FONT color=brown>assigned</FONT></I> to the quartermaster’s store.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Name">NAME</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: discharge, fire, let go, suspend, withdraw.</P>

<P>These words are used for the formal assent given to a proposed undertaking or for the official honour given upon the successful completion of a task. <B><FONT color=blue>Approval</FONT></B> is the most general and least formal of these. In the official context, it usually means the giving of permission to undertake a task. [We can’t introduce our bill in the House without first getting the committee’s <I><FONT color=brown>approval</FONT></I>; Would you initial this requisition as a sign of your <I><FONT color=brown>approval</FONT></I>?] It can also simply mean concurrence in opinion: Your suggestion met with the principal’s highest <I><FONT color=brown>approval</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Approbation</FONT></B>, the most formal of these, refers to the giving of authoritative <I><FONT color=brown>approval</FONT></I>, especially in an ecclesiastical context. It carries overtones of warmth and congeniality in a more general context, but its use ?even in many official situations ?might be thought unnecessarily pretentious: His controversial report gained the hearty <I><FONT color=brown>approbation</FONT></I> of other experts in his field.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Commendation</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sanction</FONT></B>, more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>approval</FONT></I>, are both limited almost exclusively to an official context. <I><FONT color=brown>Commendation</FONT></I> is further restricted, within this context, to formal recognition for a task well done: a <I><FONT color=brown>commendation</FONT></I> for your brilliant sales record. The word can also refer to the written document of <I><FONT color=brown>commendation</FONT></I>: He framed his <I><FONT color=brown>commendation</FONT></I> for bravery and hung it on the wall. <I><FONT color=brown>Sanction</FONT></I> can mean either before-the-act <I><FONT color=brown>approval</FONT></I> or after-the-act <I><FONT color=brown>commendation</FONT></I>. [I’m sure you can get the committee’s <I><FONT color=brown>sanction</FONT></I> to proceed for the way he had acted.] Caution must be observed in the use of this word for it can also mean, confusingly enough, official restrictive measures taken against a proposed act, a group of people, or a group’s behaviour: The anti-noise group said it would recommend <I><FONT color=brown>sanctions</FONT></I> against those factories that still offended.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Endorse">ENDORSE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: censure, disapprobation, <A href="entry://Disapproval">DISAPPROVAL</A>, dissatisfaction.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>approximately</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>about</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>around</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>roughly</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all mean within some degree of exactness or closeness, as in distance, time, amount, etc. <B><FONT color=blue>approximately</FONT></B> implies accuracy so near to a standard that the difference is not significant. [It was <I><FONT color=brown>approximately</FONT></I> 100?in the shade; <FONT face=Symbol>p</FONT> is <I><FONT color=brown>approximately</FONT></I> 3.1415.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>About</FONT></B> is often used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>approximately</FONT></I>, but it does not stress the closeness to accuracy that <I><FONT color=brown>approximately</FONT></I> does: a hat costing <I><FONT color=brown>about</FONT></I> five dollars; reaching home at <I><FONT color=brown>about</FONT></I> dinnertime. <B><FONT color=blue>Around</FONT></B> sometimes appears in informal contexts in place of <I><FONT color=brown>approximately</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>about</FONT></I>: to go to bed <I><FONT color=brown>around</FONT></I> midnight; to invite <I><FONT color=brown>around</FONT></I> fifteen people to a picnic.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Roughly</FONT></B> is often used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>approximately</FONT></I> or about when there is no real attempt to be exact. [The cost of the car repairs was estimated at <I><FONT color=brown>roughly</FONT></I> fifty dollars; The population of London is <I><FONT color=brown>roughly</FONT></I> 8,000,000.] <I><FONT color=brown>Roughly</FONT></I> also carries a suggestion of casualness or haste, which the other words do not convey. [The books were shelved <I><FONT color=brown>roughly</FONT></I> in alphabetical order; <I><FONT color=brown>Roughly</FONT></I> speaking, I would guess that we are headed for a depression.]</P>

<P>These words relate to a large and varied division of invertebrate animals. <B><FONT color=blue>Bug</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wog</FONT></B> are names loosely applied to any very small creeping, crawling, jumping or flying creature that is generally thought of as a nuisance. <I><FONT color=brown>Wog</FONT></I> is the more informal and is even applied to the completely unrelated bacteria and viruses that cause disease, especially a cold which is "going around": Sorry I can’t go ?I’ve got the <I><FONT color=brown>wog</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Bug</FONT></I> is the least specific word in the group, but <B><FONT color=blue>arthropod</FONT></B> is the inclusive, zoological term. <I><FONT color=brown>Arthropods</FONT></I> have no backbone; they are characterized by jointed legs or appendages, segmented body parts and usually, hard outer coverings. The true <I><FONT color=brown>bugs</FONT></I> belong to a special order of <I><FONT color=brown>arthropods</FONT></I> whose members have biting or sucking mouth parts, such as bedbugs, water bugs and plant bugs. <B><FONT color=blue>Beetles</FONT></B> also have biting mouth parts and have hard, horny fore wings that cover and protect their hind wings. <I><FONT color=brown>Bugs</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>beetles</FONT></I> form part of the largest class of <I><FONT color=brown>arthropods</FONT></I>, the <B><FONT color=blue>insects</FONT></B>. There are close to a million kinds of <I><FONT color=brown>insects</FONT></I>, all having bodies divided into three sections, each of which carries a pair of legs, making six legs in all. This characteristic distinguishes <I><FONT color=brown>insects</FONT></I> from <B><FONT color=blue>spiders</FONT></B>, which have eight legs and which, with scorpions, mites and ticks, are placed in another separate class of <I><FONT color=brown>arthropods</FONT></I>, the <B><FONT color=blue>arachnids</FONT></B>. The class of crustaceans includes shrimps, crabs, lobsters, barnacles and crayfish, living mostly in or near water. <B><FONT color=blue>Crustaceans</FONT></B> are characterized by tough outer shells that are shed by moulting as they grow larger.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Virus">VIRUS</A>.</P>

<P>These words pertain to the guns and other military equipment used in fighting wars. <B><FONT color=blue>Arms</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>weapons</FONT></B> are general terms, nearly interchangeable, for the instruments of combat. A bow-and-arrow, sword or rifle are all <I><FONT color=brown>arms</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>weapons</FONT></I>. Of the two terms, <I><FONT color=brown>arms</FONT></I> is more frequently restricted in use to those weapons that an individual soldier can wield, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>weapons</FONT></I> are anything used in the fight, from chance sticks and stones to hydrogen bombs. In its most general sense, <I><FONT color=brown>arms</FONT></I> can also refer to the whole military capability of a country: Both nations bankrupted themselves in their foolish race to manufacture <I><FONT color=brown>arms</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Armament</FONT></B> is similar in meaning to this last sense of arms, but it is much clearer in that it points without confusion both to the <I><FONT color=brown>weapons</FONT></I> and the military equipment used to wage war: The country’s <I><FONT color=brown>armament</FONT></I> includes the most versatile planes, the fastest ships and the most rugged tanks in the world. <I><FONT color=brown>Armament</FONT></I> may also be used to refer to the total <I><FONT color=brown>weapons</FONT></I> available to a military vehicle: The destroyer’s <I><FONT color=brown>armament</FONT></I> consists of several small cannon, two torpedo tubes and a number of anti-aircraft guns. <B><FONT color=blue>Ordnance</FONT></B> may be used, like <I><FONT color=brown>armament</FONT></I>, for the total military effort of a country, but much more commonly refers specifically to heavy firearms, mounted cannon or mortars, and other heavy artillery.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Materiel</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>munitions</FONT></B> both refer to equipment rather than to weapons. <I><FONT color=brown>Materiel</FONT></I> suggests all the supporting equipment and supplies necessary to combat, while <I><FONT color=brown>munitions</FONT></I> most commonly suggests <I><FONT color=brown>ammunition</FONT></I> only: Dry socks are as important an item of materiel as <I><FONT color=brown>munitions</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Arsenal</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>deterrent</FONT></B> have come into fairly recent use to refer to a country’s nuclear arms. <I><FONT color=brown>Arsenal</FONT></I> previously meant simply a place where weapons are stored, but in this specific instance it indicates a stockpile of nuclear warheads. <I><FONT color=brown>Deterrent</FONT></I> is an almost euphemistic word for a nuclear <I><FONT color=brown>arsenal</FONT></I>: The atomic <I><FONT color=brown>arsenal</FONT></I> of either nation alone could lay waste to the entire planet, yet each emerging country clamours to build its own <I><FONT color=brown>deterrent</FONT></I> as well.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Fleet">FLEET</A>, <A href="entry://Troops">TROOPS</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to makers or constructors of products at some level below that of artistic creation. An <B><FONT color=blue>artisan</FONT></B> falls midway between the full-scale artist who creates single inimitable words and the mere worker who turns out identical, anonymous products: Italian <I><FONT color=brown>artisans</FONT></I> were imported to New York expressly to hand-carve the masonry on the brownstone buildings of the 1890s. <I><FONT color=brown>Artisan</FONT></I> was once much closer in meaning to artist, as witness the stained-glass windows of a medieval cathedral. These were created by anonymous <I><FONT color=brown>artisans</FONT></I>, but they are often great works of art none the less. <B><FONT color=blue>Artificer</FONT></B> still can suggest its earliest meaning of a worker who possesses mechanical facility: the <I><FONT color=brown>artificer</FONT></I> in an infantry company who cares for and repairs its weapons. In other uses <I><FONT color=brown>artificer</FONT></I> had begun to sound fusty until James Joyce re-introduced the word <I><FONT color=brown>in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</FONT></I> to stand for the artist as creator and controller of art and life. It has sometimes been used since in this highest sense.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Craftsman</FONT></B> has risen somewhat in the scale to the artist end of the spectrum since the advent of machine-made objects in the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century: Replaced by factories, the furniture-maker, the bookbinder, the dyer and the weaver were all skilled <I><FONT color=brown>craftsmen</FONT></I> whose century-old secrets were lost during the industrial revolution. <I><FONT color=brown>Craftsman</FONT></I> is now a common term to describe a worker in the minor arts; a ceramist or a pottery-maker would not feel insulted to be called a <I><FONT color=brown>craftsman</FONT></I>. In the other arts, the word is used of an artist unusually adept in the technical aspects of his art: The young poet was an extraordinary <I><FONT color=brown>craftsman</FONT></I> simply from the standpoint of the variety of poetic forms that he could command effectively.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Creator</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>designer</FONT></B> in the minor arts are parallel terms and imply the existence of a subordinate who carries a plan into effect. The person named on the playbill as the <I><FONT color=brown>creator</FONT></I> of a play’s costumes conceived and sketched them; someone else probably made them. A fashion, book-cover or car <I><FONT color=brown>designer</FONT></I> plans the physical appearance of the completed product down to the smallest detail, but <I><FONT color=brown>craftsmen</FONT></I> and other workers actually make up or build according to the designs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Workman</FONT></B> implies someone who has more <I><FONT color=brown>craftsmanship</FONT></I> than a worker would possess but far less than an artisan. [We called in an <I><FONT color=brown>artisan</FONT></I> to repair the broken base of our Sèvres vase; At the same time, <I><FONT color=brown>workmen</FONT></I> arrived to fix our leaky roof.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artist">ARTIST</A>, <A href="entry://Labourer">LABOURER</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to people who produce works of art. <B><FONT color=blue>Artist</FONT></B>, in one of its uses, is the most general and all-inclusive of these, indicating a practitioner of any one of the fine or applied arts: <I><FONT color=brown>artists</FONT></I> who paint, compose music, or write novels. Its main usefulness lies in the fact that it can refer equally well as a group word to workers in diverse fields: a section of the city where all kinds of <I><FONT color=brown>artists</FONT></I> lived. By extension, the word is often used of someone who shows unusual taste or discrimination in other tasks: a real <I><FONT color=brown>artist</FONT></I> when it came to planning and giving interesting parties. When the word is not clearly a group word, however, it can often be taken to apply more strictly to the visual arts, especially to painting: a gathering place for <I><FONT color=brown>artists</FONT></I> and writers. <B><FONT color=blue>Painter</FONT></B> thus specifically emphasizes one of the possible meanings of <I><FONT color=brown>artist</FONT></I>, to the exclusion of all others. In general, <I><FONT color=brown>artist</FONT></I> can be replaced to advantage by the more specific term whenever appropriate: gatherings of painters, sculptors, novelists, poets and composers.</P><P>The remaining words all relate to <I><FONT color=brown>artist</FONT></I>, rather than painter, in grouping a variety of specific roles under one general heading. <B><FONT color=blue>Creator</FONT></B> emphasizes the origination of artistic ideas by single person; it may or may not imply that others being the idea to its realization: the <I><FONT color=brown>creator</FONT></I> of huge canvasses teeming with scenes of Venetian life; a man credited as the <I><FONT color=brown>creator</FONT></I> of a film on which many had collaborated. The word also has a use to refer to an <I><FONT color=brown>artist</FONT></I> who works in a number of media: the <I><FONT color=brown>creator</FONT></I> of frescoes, architectural designs and sonnets. The word is also used in the applied arts, sometimes to lend aesthetic appeal to business: the <I><FONT color=brown>creator</FONT></I> of a new line of autumn fashions.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Craftsman</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stylist</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>virtuoso</FONT></B> are general words that emphasize technical skill or flair when substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>artist</FONT></I>. In this context, <I><FONT color=brown>craftsman</FONT></I> suggests any <I><FONT color=brown>artist</FONT></I> who lavishes painstaking care on the construction of his work and is consciously concerned with fine details: a real <I><FONT color=brown>craftsman</FONT></I> in his ability to shape dialogue towards natural and inevitable climaxes. <I><FONT color=brown>Stylist</FONT></I> suggests an artist unusually gifted with a flair for working in one of the short story. The word can also be used of lesser or applied arts to suggest singularity or professionality: hair <I><FONT color=brown>stylist</FONT></I>; a unique song <I><FONT color=brown>stylist</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Virtuoso</FONT></I> originally applied to a musical performer who was able to execute difficult passages with apparent ease and bravura. Now it may refer to any artist, as well, who shows unique mastery of technical difficulties or is especially given to display of technical facility: a <I><FONT color=brown>virtuoso</FONT></I> in the sonnet form; a <I><FONT color=brown>virtuoso</FONT></I> who, for all his technique, remains a shallow and superficial <I><FONT color=brown>artist</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>.</P>

<P>These words describe qualities in a work of art, its creator or its appreciator. <B><FONT color=blue>Artistic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>aesthetic</FONT></B> are closely related; most simply, the <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> instinct belongs to the creator, the <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> instinct to the beholder: <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> skill; <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> pleasure. In another sense, however, the <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> attitude might be taken as generic, the <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> attitude as a specific but by no means exhaustive example of the more general term. In this distinction, the <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> instinct expresses itself in all areas of life where taste, discrimination, style and balance are desirable: an <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> flower arrangement; an <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> flair for matching the right wine to the right entrée. In yet another sense, <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> describes specifically those discriminations sorted out by <I><FONT color=brown>aestheticians</FONT></I>; one connotation here may be unnecessary refinement or passivity as opposed to the boldness and activity of the <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> attitude: too bogged down in <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> distinctions to have any <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> spontaneity. In describing a work of art rather than an attitude, <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> would be largely irrelevant, <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> inane or tautological. Both may be used to praise creations not commonly thought of as works of art: an <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> grouping of furniture.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Arty</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mannered</FONT></B> both refer to attitudes that tend towards parody of the <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> sensibility. <I><FONT color=brown>Arty</FONT></I>, the more strongly negative of the two, is also the most informal of any of these words. It suggests the phoniness of the poseur or artist manqué, stressing particularly that exaggerated and affected behaviour that may be totally unrelated to the creation of works of art: the <I><FONT color=brown>arty</FONT></I> bohemian crowd in Greewich Village. <I><FONT color=brown>Mannered</FONT></I> is more formal and more restrained in its disapproval. It suggests behaviour that is contrived and unnatural, the <I><FONT color=brown>mannered</FONT></I>, fey look of her costume. The word can also refer to the work of art itself, suggesting the same qualities of contrived <I><FONT color=brown>artificiality</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Artificial</FONT></B> most often refers only to the work, suggesting a lack of spontaneity and of naturalness. It is more negative in tone than <I><FONT color=brown>mannered</FONT></I>. The latter may suggest worthwhile <I><FONT color=brown>Artificial</FONT></I> content that has been harmed by unnecessary stylistic manipulation., on the other hand, suggests a lack of content that a pretentious style is struggling to conceal. <B><FONT color=blue>Stylized</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>mannered</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>artificial</FONT></I> in suggesting an emphasis on mode as opposed to content, but it contrasts with them in ranging from a neutral to an approving tone; the <I><FONT color=brown>stylized</FONT></I> patterns of the kabuki dances. It emphasizes the ordering of the artist’s raw materials into significant, if unrealistic, designs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Precious</FONT></B> is the most negative in tone of any word here and is the most widespread in range, applying to the work, the artist, or to some one who is not <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> in any way. It points to a taste for the genteel and over-elegant, especially when these qualities are as far removed as possible from reality or normality. It suggests a complaisant attempt to be different and striking, and typically results in <I><FONT color=brown>overstylized</FONT></I> affectation ?"slick" in the worst sense of the word: a <I><FONT color=brown>precious</FONT></I> writer of the late 19<SUP>th</SUP> century "Mauve Decade" in English literature; a <I><FONT color=brown>precious</FONT></I> way of speaking.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tasteful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>harmonious</FONT></B> refer to <I><FONT color=brown>aesthetic</FONT></I> qualities that may be found in <I><FONT color=brown>artistic</FONT></I> works. <I><FONT color=brown>Tasteful</FONT></I> is extremely subjective in referring to what is in accordance with the canons of taste; what is <I><FONT color=brown>tasteful</FONT></I> to one person, such as a pink and purple Christmas tree, might be thought vulgar by another. <I><FONT color=brown>Harmonious</FONT></I> is more objective in pointing to a smooth, well-balanced relation of parts: a <I><FONT color=brown>harmonious</FONT></I> ordering of the room’s spatial relationships.

Whatever one <I><FONT color=brown>asserts</FONT></I> he would defend in argument, but whether anyone believes something <I><FONT color=brown>alleged</FONT></I> is beside the point; the aim of <I><FONT color=brown>alleging</FONT></I> is to learn the truth by proving or disproving the claim made.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Affirm</FONT></B> means to declare or state positively that something is true; it indicates firm belief or unshakable conviction: to <I><FONT color=brown>affirm</FONT></I> one’s faith in God. <B><FONT color=blue>Asseverate</FONT></B> is nearly synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>assert</FONT></I> but even more positive; the word is uncommon even in formal writing. <B><FONT color=blue>Testify</FONT></B> means to bear witness, as in a court of law, or declare solemnly to be true: to <I><FONT color=brown>testify</FONT></I> on behalf of the defendant; I can <I><FONT color=brown>testify</FONT></I> to this man’s veracity and good character.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Maintain</FONT></B>, as here considered, means to <I><FONT color=brown>assert</FONT></I> something in the face of evidence or arguments to the contrary: in spite of circumstantial evidence pointing to his guilt, the accused <I><FONT color=brown>maintained</FONT></I> that he was innocent. <I><FONT color=brown>Maintain</FONT></I> almost always involves controversy or disagreement; it presupposes a prior statement to which one is adhering, and in this sense is a reaffirming of one’s position.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Aver</FONT></B> means to declare confidently as fact. <B><FONT color=blue>Avouch</FONT></B> means to vouch for or affirm positively. <B><FONT color=blue>Avow</FONT></B> means to declare openly: to <I><FONT color=brown>avow</FONT></I> one’s guilt.

<P>These words apply to a person who contributes to the accomplishment of a task. <B><FONT color=blue>Assistant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>helper</FONT></B> are nearly identical except for the latter’s greater informality. Because of this difference, <I><FONT color=brown>helper</FONT></I> may seem warmer in tone, implying affection, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I> remains coolly objective. [She had to admit that her husband was a good <I><FONT color=brown>helper</FONT></I> around the house; It is not unusual for a woman executive to have a man as her <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I>.] Furthermore, one might become someone else’s <I><FONT color=brown>helper</FONT></I> out of generosity, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I> usually implies a paid position within a profession and is sometimes part of an official title: a <I><FONT color=brown>helper</FONT></I> on the cake stall; <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I> of the sales manager.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Subordinate</FONT></B> emphasizes the inferiority of a <I><FONT color=brown>helper</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I>, and its greater formality does not always mitigate an overtone of condescension, sometimes extending even to contempt. [The company sergeant-major treated the lieutenants as though they were merely his <I><FONT color=brown>subordinates</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>subordinate</FONT></I> can, however, be neutral in tone, merely describing an unequal relationship: a trusted <I><FONT color=brown>subordinate</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Adjutant</FONT></B> and aide are drawn from military life to describe the administrative <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>subordinate</FONT></I> of a superior officer. <B><FONT color=blue>Aide</FONT></B>, because of its brevity, has come to be used for an administrative <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I> of considerable prestige who acts on behalf of, or as a personal <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I> to a high-ranking superior. <I><FONT color=brown>Aide</FONT></I> is also simply an unqualified <I><FONT color=brown>assistant</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>subordinate</FONT></I> in the special sense of nurse’s <I><FONT color=brown>aide</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accomplice">ACCOMPLICE</A>, <A href="entry://Associate">ASSOCIATE</A>.</P>

<P>The words in this set refer to professional, business, or work relationships between people. <B><FONT color=blue>Associate</FONT></B> is the least specific of these; its formality would suggest a business or professional context. While it implies close connection, the relationship might be the result of choice, chance or necessity; a man’s business <I><FONT color=brown>associates</FONT></I>. In a more specific use, <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I> is a component of some professional titles, denoting the second of three ranks: an <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I> editor; an <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I> professor. It is also used specifically to indicate less than full membership in a group; A member pays $40 annually in dues, but you can become an <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I> for $10. In this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I> may refer either to a person or to a group within a larger group. <B><FONT color=blue>Affiliate</FONT></B> compares with this use of <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I> in being now mostly used of a group related to another group: the television <I><FONT color=brown>affiliate</FONT></I> of a city newspaper. It is frequently used to relate a small group to a national or international parent group: the local <I><FONT color=brown>affiliate</FONT></I> of the Royal Life Saving Society. The word suggest that two <I><FONT color=brown>affiliates</FONT></I> are co-equal in a loose relationship of autonomous groups, even when a smaller-to-larger hierarchy is involved. This contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I> in its suggestion of subordinate membership in a group.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ally</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>partner</FONT></B> may apply either to individuals or to groups. <I><FONT color=brown>Ally</FONT></I> always suggests a relationship of choice. One’s <I><FONT color=brown>allies</FONT></I> unite with one in a common cause and most often against a common enemy. <I><FONT color=brown>Allies</FONT></I> are not necessarily friends outside the cause that jointly concerns them: The two members were enemies on questions of domestic affairs, but <I><FONT color=brown>allies</FONT></I> on foreign policy. <I><FONT color=brown>Ally</FONT></I> is chiefly used in reference to nations that are on the same side in an international war: England and Russia were <I><FONT color=brown>allies</FONT></I> in World War II. <I><FONT color=brown>Partner</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>ally</FONT></I>, may apply to one nation joined with another in a common cause: France and England were partners in an atomic power project. But partner often indicates a close or contractual relationship. It is the legal term for one of he co-owners of a business: He was made a <I><FONT color=brown>partner</FONT></I> in the firm. And it may also refer to a much more personal association: marriage <I><FONT color=brown>partners</FONT></I>. Unlike the other words in this group, <I><FONT color=brown>partner</FONT></I> sometimes points to a one-to-one relationship involving a couple or a pair: his dancing <I><FONT color=brown>partner</FONT></I>; to draw for <I><FONT color=brown>partners</FONT></I> in playing bridge.</P><P>The remaining words refer exclusively to person-to-person relationships, as does <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I> in its more general sense. <B><FONT color=blue>Co-worker</FONT></B> is the least formal of these and applies as readily to manual labour as to more highly skilled occupations: his <I><FONT color=brown>co-workers</FONT></I> in the factory; his <I><FONT color=brown>co-worker</FONT></I> on the government’s conservation project. <I><FONT color=brown>Co-worker</FONT></I> is distinctly neutral in tone, implying neither animosity nor the cordiality that may be suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>associate</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Colleague</FONT></B> is restricted almost solely in use to professional <I><FONT color=brown>association</FONT></I>. It is formal in tone, but may range in feeling from neutrality to an expression of respect or approbation: my colleagues in the philosophy department. <B><FONT color=blue>Fellow</FONT></B>, as here considered, is now seldom used except as a title or component. In an academic context, it may mean a graduate student on a fellowship grant, but it may also be used of certain faculty positions: a Fulbright <I><FONT color=brown>fellow</FONT></I> at Auckland University; a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accomplice">ACCOMPLICE</A>, <A href="entry://Assistant">ASSISTANT</A>, <A href="entry://Friend">FRIEND</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Opponent">OPPONENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to make or attempt to make something certain or secure by removing doubt. <B><FONT color=blue>Assure</FONT></B> can mean either to make certain or to cause to feel certain. [The doctor <I><FONT color=brown>assured</FONT></I> him that his child would recover from the illness; The fact that the hospital had a good reputation <I><FONT color=brown>assured</FONT></I> him that his child would be well taken care of.] <B><FONT color=blue>Ensure</FONT></B>, or, as it is also spelt, <I><FONT color=brown>insure</FONT></I>, means to make certain as the consequence of some action or agent: To <I><FONT color=brown>ensure</FONT></I> the child’s quick recovery, the doctor gave him an antibiotic. <I><FONT color=brown>Ensure</FONT></I> also means to make safe, to protect against harm; to <I><FONT color=brown>ensure</FONT></I> freedom against tyranny.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Guarantee</FONT></B> means to assume responsibility for the quality of a product or for the performance of a service or obligation.

<B><FONT color=blue>attainment</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>accomplishment</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>acquirement</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>acquisition</FONT></B>:

<P>These words, as here considered, refer to a capability resulting, at least in part, from conscious effort. All are frequently used in the plural. <B><FONT color=blue>Attainment</FONT></B> is the loftiest term. It implies a fully developed talent which leads to eminence in the arts, in science or in some comparable field of endeavour: Bertrand Russell is not only a distinguished philosopher but also a man of high literary <I><FONT color=brown>attainments</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Accomplishment</FONT></B>, in this sense, refers to any ability or manner acquired from practice or experience; specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>accomplishments</FONT></I> are social graces meant to please or entertain. [In the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, a young woman of many <I><FONT color=brown>accomplishments</FONT></I> might sing, play the piano and paint; Skill in dancing and the ability to make small talk are <I><FONT color=brown>accomplishments</FONT></I> considered desirable by most adolescents.]</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>acquirement</FONT></B> is a skill gained by study or practice rather than through natural talent.

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Attraction</FONT></B> refers to the power or quality that draws a person to another person, an idea or a thing. An <B><FONT color=blue>affinity</FONT></B> is a natural or instinctive attraction or inclination: an <I><FONT color=brown>affinity</FONT></I> among children of the same age. <I><FONT color=brown>Attraction</FONT></I> means the power to attract.

<P>These words refer to the wielding of power by a single person or a small group of people, usually without the consent of the governed. <B><FONT color=blue>Authoritarian</FONT></B>, the most general of these, is also the most objectively descriptive and least disapproving in tone, although any of these words will have negative implications for the citizens of a democracy. <I><FONT color=brown>Authoritarian</FONT></I> may describe any form of rule ?from a monarchy to a democracy ?in which unquestioning obedience to those in power is expected or demanded: the military junta that instituted such <I><FONT color=brown>authoritarian</FONT></I> measures as censorship of the press; children whose upbringing was neither permissive nor <I><FONT color=brown>authoritarian</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Paternalistic</FONT></B> refers to an authoritarian tendency that sees a populace as childlike and unable to govern itself. The word may suggest either benevolent rule or a style of government determined to keep the governed helpless and dependent: the <I><FONT color=brown>paternalistic</FONT></I> stance of most banana republics; the <I><FONT color=brown>paternalistic</FONT></I> attitude of some university authorities towards their students. <B><FONT color=blue>Oligarchic</FONT></B> refers to the rule of an elite, but does not suggest what grounds are used to determine who is a member of this ruling group: the <I><FONT color=brown>oligarchic</FONT></I> power of the English nobility before the rise of the monarchy. <B><FONT color=blue>Plutocratic</FONT></B> suggests an <I><FONT color=brown>oligarchic</FONT></I> rule based specifically on wealth: the emergence of the first <I><FONT color=brown>plutocratic</FONT></I> industrial giants of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century.</P><P>The remaining words are all much harsher in tone than the foregoing. Of these, <B><FONT color=blue>autocratic</FONT></B> is the mildest, though stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>authoritarian</FONT></I>. It suggests the absolute rule of a single person, but such a rule may be as repressive or benevolent as the person chooses: <I><FONT color=brown>autocratic</FONT></I> rulers as different as Queen Elizabeth I and Louis XIV; the rare husband who still insists on <I><FONT color=brown>autocratic</FONT></I> control over his family.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Totalitarian</FONT></B> is perhaps the least exact of these words in its implications. It suggests the concentration of power in the hands of the few; it also suggests the context of a modern collectivist state. A <I><FONT color=brown>totalitarian</FONT></I> government is certainly <I><FONT color=brown>authoritarian</FONT></I>, but may or may not be <I><FONT color=brown>oligarchic</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>plutocratic</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>paternalistic</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>autocratic</FONT></I>. Such a state would certainly suppress civil liberties, but might still have a benevolent notion, however, misguided, if its duties to the people. On the other hand, it might be based exclusively on the self-aggrandisement and greed of a ruling class: the Puritans of the New World who, out of self-defence, constructed what amounted to a <I><FONT color=brown>totalitarian</FONT></I> state; a Stalinist regime that was more <I><FONT color=brown>totalitarian</FONT></I> than those that preceded or followed it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dictatorial</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tyrannical</FONT></B> both may be simply descriptive of <I><FONT color=brown>autocratic</FONT></I> rule, but more often suggest strong disapproval for repressive tactics. <I><FONT color=brown>Dictatorial</FONT></I>, at its most neutral, specifically refers to leaders other than hereditary rulers such as kings. At its most negative, it suggests repressive harshness: Cromwell, who was less <I><FONT color=brown>dictatorial</FONT></I> than many kings; family life embittered by her <I><FONT color=brown>dictatorial</FONT></I> maternalism; companies no longer <I><FONT color=brown>dictatorial</FONT></I> towards their employees. <I><FONT color=brown>Tyrannical</FONT></I> may once have been most appropriate to describe the power of a king, but now it applies more generally to any arbitrary, almost whimsical one-men rule: the <I><FONT color=brown>tyrannical</FONT></I> head of the Parliamentary committee; his <I><FONT color=brown>tyrannical</FONT></I> outburst against his son’s disobedience.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fascist</FONT></B> (also <B><FONT color=blue>fascistic</FONT></B>) and <B><FONT color=blue>despotic</FONT></B> are the most harshly negative of all these words. <I><FONT color=brown>Fascist</FONT></I> in its narrowest sense applies to a strongly nationalistic and militaristic right-wing regime that suppresses civil liberties and attacks selected minorities: the <I><FONT color=brown>fascist</FONT></I> tendencies of many anti-Semites. The word, however, is often used loosely as pure invective for any authoritarian stand: <I><FONT color=brown>fascist</FONT></I> gangsters who took control of the neighbourhood. <I><FONT color=brown>Despotic</FONT></I> could once be applied less negatively to any absolute, <I><FONT color=brown>autocratic</FONT></I> rule, but now it would be more often understood as indicating a fiercely cruel and savagely repressive ruler or government: the rapidly disappearing <I><FONT color=brown>despotic</FONT></I> family head; a government so <I><FONT color=brown>despotic</FONT></I> that citizens could be shot without a trial.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: compliant, constitutional, democratic, free, lenient, liberal, limited, permissive.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Auxiliary</FONT></B>, like the rest of these words, refers to something that gives additional help or support. The help given is usually similar to but less important than the main effort being made: The <I><FONT color=brown>auxiliary</FONT></I> units are called in only when the main force has been overtaxed. Sometimes the word can refer simply to additional or supplementary resources: an oil firm with <I><FONT color=brown>auxiliary</FONT></I> investments in shipbuilding and car parts. Sometimes the word seems to be used almost euphemistically to avoid any suggestion of subordination or inferiority to the main item: the ladies <I><FONT color=brown>auxiliary</FONT></I> committee.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>auxiliary</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>ancillary</FONT></B> may refer to something useful that may or may not be called into action. The <I><FONT color=brown>ancillary</FONT></I> item, however, may be dissimilar though closely related to what it supports: psychology as <I><FONT color=brown>ancillary</FONT></I> to the study of literature. In other instances, <I><FONT color=brown>ancillary</FONT></I>, more than any of the other words, may suggest a dependence of the main thing on the <I><FONT color=brown>ancillary</FONT></I> thing, almost as if the latter were its prerequisite, or preceded it in time: Counterpoint and harmony are certainly <I><FONT color=brown>ancillary</FONT></I> to serious composition.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Contributory</FONT></B> suggests a definite cause-and-effect relationship unique among these words, indicating one of several factors that result in a particular effect. The <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I> cause, however, only accompanies a major cause: Underground sabotage was a <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I> factor in the German retreat before the Allied onslaught. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>ancillary</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>auxiliary</FONT></I> items, something that is <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I> exists only if actually called into action; it cannot be held in abeyance and still be <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I>. Also, a <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I> factor may be part of destructive as well as a constructive result: Cigarette smoking may be regarded as a <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I> cause of cancer in his case.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Secondary</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>subsidiary</FONT></B> both clearly state the subordination or inferiority of the added factor. <I><FONT color=brown>Secondary</FONT></I> relates to <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I> in having a cause-and-effect meaning, but unlike <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I>, can refer to both causes and effects. A <I><FONT color=brown>contributory</FONT></I> cause, for example, may result only in a <I><FONT color=brown>secondary</FONT></I> effect. <I><FONT color=brown>Secondary</FONT></I> may be applied in any context where comparison is made between primary values, goals, benefits and less important or gratuitous ones. In this respect, <I><FONT color=brown>subsidiary</FONT></I> is more specific, meaning all the attached ramifications that may exist together with a primary situation: an author’s <I><FONT color=brown>subsidiary</FONT></I> rights in the stage and film versions of his novel; a main store’s <I><FONT color=brown>subsidiary</FONT></I> branches. <I><FONT color=brown>Subsidiary</FONT></I>, in this sense, is most like auxiliary in suggesting a similar but less important aspect of a larger whole.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Addition">ADDITION</A>, <A href="entry://Assistant">ASSISTANT</A>, <A href="entry://Assistant">SUBORDINATE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Avoid</FONT></B> means to keep away from or keep at a distance, either by design or as the automatic or accidental consequence of an action. [He drove home over the bridge to <I><FONT color=brown>avoid</FONT></I> the traffic congestion at the sports ground; By driving home over the bridge he unknowingly <I><FONT color=brown>avoided</FONT></I> the sports-ground congestion.] </P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Escape</FONT></B> in its basic sense refers similarly to a deliberate or accidental keeping clear of something. A criminal may adopt a ruse to <I><FONT color=brown>escape</FONT></I>. Detection, or he may <I><FONT color=brown>escape</FONT></I> apprehension by the death of the only witness. <I><FONT color=brown>Escape</FONT></I> is also used with the sense of to manage to avoid, or to remain untouched or uninfluenced by something evil or harmful: to <I><FONT color=brown>escape</FONT></I> being injured by the falling debris.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>elude</FONT></B> is to avoid or escape by the use of dexterity or artifice. A half-back may <I><FONT color=brown>elude</FONT></I> tacklers by a side-step; a fugitive may <I><FONT color=brown>elude</FONT></I> pursuers by planting false clues. <B><FONT color=blue>Evade</FONT></B> may sometimes be used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>elude</FONT></I>, but often carries the connotation of avoidance of duty or obligation by underhanded methods: a taxpayer who <I><FONT color=brown>evaded</FONT></I> taxes by falsifying his accounts ?a punishable offence ?although he might legally have <I><FONT color=brown>avoided</FONT></I> a portion of the tax by taking advantage of allowable deductions; a soldier who <I><FONT color=brown>evades</FONT></I> hazardous duty by malingering.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shun</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>eschew</FONT></B> are to <I><FONT color=brown>avoid</FONT></I> with repugnance or distaste, or for reasons of morality or prudence.

Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>eschew</FONT></I> points to abstention, <I><FONT color=brown>shun</FONT></I> may indicate either abstention or physical withdrawal; one can <I><FONT color=brown>shun</FONT></I> people as well as thing.

<P>These words refer to the inner portions of a country, to rural regions, or to those remote from cosmopolitan or urban centres. <B><FONT color=blue>Backblocks</FONT></B> is the most general of these and can apply to any of the three situations listed above; its connotations imply a provincial area that is sparsely settled or unimportant: tourists who visit the country’s principal cities but seldom go into the <I><FONT color=brown>backblocks</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Interior</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>inland</FONT></B> are restricted in reference to the inner portions a country, rural or urban, both words having fewer connotations than the previous one. <I><FONT color=brown>Inland</FONT></I> may suggest the greater remoteness of these two words: the <I><FONT color=brown>inland</FONT></I> of the continent; the <I><FONT color=brown>interior</FONT></I> of the island. <I><FONT color=brown>Interior</FONT></I> can, however, suggest greater inaccessibility: an <I><FONT color=brown>inland</FONT></I> lake; the first expeditions to the <I><FONT color=brown>interior</FONT></I> of Africa. Midlands can also function neutrally, but is used mostly to refer to <I><FONT color=brown>inland</FONT></I> regions of England: the great industrial cities of the midlands. Neither remoteness nor inaccessibility is implied here, although provinciality may be indicated.</P><P>Much more popular and less formal than inland or interior is <B><FONT color=blue>bush</FONT></B>, which is widely used to refer to extensive, unsettled or sparsely settled regions, as well as to an area of <I><FONT color=brown>bushland</FONT></I> anywhere. The idiom <I><FONT color=brown>go bush</FONT></I> can mean to leave a town or city for remoter regions or simply to disappear for a while. <B><FONT color=blue>Outback</FONT></B> is a Australian word, referring generally to the arid or semi-arid areas that constitute the major portion of the continent. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>bush</FONT></I> can refer to an area not built on, and both <I><FONT color=brown>bush</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>backblocks</FONT></I> can indicate inland regions not necessarily far removed from centres of population, <I><FONT color=brown>outback</FONT></I> conveys a suggestion of extreme remoteness from civilization: children of the <I><FONT color=brown>outback</FONT></I>, learning their lessons by radio in a "classroom" covering a million square miles; the trackless wastes of the far outback, where only an Aborigine could survive. <B><FONT color=blue>Sticks</FONT></B> is an informal American word pertaining to rural areas or provincial centres that are unsophisticated or backward. It is always somewhat derogatory or disparaging in tone: a hick from the <I><FONT color=brown>sticks</FONT></I>; like so many young men who left the <I><FONT color=brown>sticks</FONT></I> to seek his fortune in the big city. Where it is used in Australia and New Zealand, sticks also has this rural sense but frequently it is part of a disparaging reference to an outer suburb as being "the <I><FONT color=brown>sticks</FONT></I>" or "in the <I><FONT color=brown>sticks</FONT></I>" because it is so far from the city.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Plain">PLAIN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://City">CITY</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>grill</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bake</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>barbecue</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>broil</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>roast</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all mean to cook food by exposing it to dry heat. <B><FONT color=blue>Grill</FONT></B>, which is synonymous with the American term broil, refers to the rapid cooking of small pieces of food by intense, direct heat. Fish, fowl, meat and some vegetables such as tomatoes and mushrooms are grilled. In <I><FONT color=brown>grilling</FONT></I>, one surface of the food is exposed to the heating source at a time. Because of the intensity of the heat these surfaces are sealed, allowing the meat, fish, etc., to retain its juices with their intrinsic flavour and nutritive value. <I><FONT color=brown>Grilling</FONT></I> requires the use of a grill or gridiron, which is a metal grate set in a frame. The food to be cooked is placed on this grate; the heating source is above or below the grate: to <I><FONT color=brown>grill</FONT></I> a chop.</P><P>Before the invention of the stove, <B><FONT color=blue>roast</FONT></B> meant to cook by exposure to the heat of an open fire or flame, and it usually referred to the cooking of a large piece of meat or even a whole animal or fowl: to <I><FONT color=brown>roast</FONT></I> a pig. <I><FONT color=brown>Roasting</FONT></I> was a slower process than <I><FONT color=brown>grilling</FONT></I>; the food to be cooked was often placed on a spit that could be turned in order to let all sides of the food be exposed to the source of heat. Today <I><FONT color=brown>roasting</FONT></I> is done in an oven where the food is cooked by radiant and reflected heat and, in addition, by heat that is transferred from the pan in which the food is being cooked. This kind of <I><FONT color=brown>roasting</FONT></I> is faster than the older method, but is still a slower process than <I><FONT color=brown>grilling</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Roast</FONT></I> is also used to denote the placing of food in hot ashes, embers, stones, etc., and the keeping of it there long enough for it to be cooked. And it may mean to dry and parch under the action of heat: to <I><FONT color=brown>roast</FONT></I> coffee; <I><FONT color=brown>roasted</FONT></I> peanuts.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bake</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>roast</FONT></I> in that it refers to cooking by dry, continuous heat in an oven or similar enclosed unit. There is no difference between these two terms as far as the method of cooking is concerned. The difference between <I><FONT color=brown>roast</FONT></I> and bake is that the former is used almost exclusively in reference to large pieces of meat or fowl, while the latter can be applied as well to anything else that is cooked in an oven: to <I><FONT color=brown>bake</FONT></I> a cake; to <I><FONT color=brown>bake</FONT></I> fish; to <I><FONT color=brown>bake</FONT></I> a casserole of meat and vegetables; <I><FONT color=brown>baked</FONT></I> potatoes. To <B><FONT color=blue>barbecue</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>grill</FONT></I> or roast meat (usually beef, pork or chicken) either on a spit or gridiron or else over a trench called a barbecue pit. One may <I><FONT color=brown>barbecue</FONT></I> meat over coals or an open fire. Modern <I><FONT color=brown>barbecuing</FONT></I> devices range from the small tripod type with concave hot plate, fuelled with chips or charcoal, to the rotisserie which has a gas or electrical heating unit. <I><FONT color=brown>Barbecued</FONT></I> food may consist of a whole animal or large pieces of one. In many cases the meat is marinated and <I><FONT color=brown>basted</FONT></I> with some kind of highly seasoned sauce: <I><FONT color=brown>barbecued</FONT></I> loin chops. As a noun, <I><FONT color=brown>barbecue</FONT></I> refers generally to an outdoor party at which the guests eat <I><FONT color=brown>barbecued</FONT></I> food: Can you come to a <I><FONT color=brown>barbecue</FONT></I> at our place on Saturday night?</P><P>Applied to human beings, <I><FONT color=brown>broil</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>roast</FONT></I> mean to get or be extremely hot and sweaty: travellers <I><FONT color=brown>broiling</FONT></I> in the sun as they cross the desert; passengers <I><FONT color=brown>roasting</FONT></I> in a hot car during a traffic jam. <I><FONT color=brown>Bake</FONT></I> may mean to tan in the sun, as while sunbathing, but usually refers to excessive exposure. In a more informal sense, <I><FONT color=brown>roast</FONT></I> may also mean to criticize or ridicule severely, whether in earnest or as a form of good-humoured raillery. The captain <I><FONT color=brown>roasted</FONT></I> his players over their dropped catches and slowness in the field.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boil">BOIL</A>, <A href="entry://Hot">HOT</A>, <A href="entry://Question">QUESTION</A> (v.).</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>banal</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fatuous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inane</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>insipid</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>jejune</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>vapid</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to what is offensive to good taste because of its want of sense, significance or freshness. <B><FONT color=blue>Banal</FONT></B>, most strictly, refers to something that is so commonplace that it lacks freshness: jokes, hoary-headed with age. But the word has gathered connotations that go beyond this strict meaning, referring to an odious or deplorable lack of taste: another season of <I><FONT color=brown>banal</FONT></I> television programmes.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>insipid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vapid</FONT></B>, like the Latin words from which they come can literally refer to foods that lack savour. In applying to what is tasteless or gauche, both words also point to staleness, flatness, or want of spirit. They are often thought to be interchangeable, but subtle differences between them can be felt. <I><FONT color=brown>Insipid</FONT></I> is especially pertinent for describing instances of expression or behaviour suggesting weakness or feebleness; this contrasts it with <I><FONT color=brown>banal</FONT></I>, which suggests outrageous bad taste: choosing between the <I><FONT color=brown>insipid</FONT></I> dullness of a drawing-room comedy and the <I><FONT color=brown>banal</FONT></I> mediocrity of a musical extravaganza. <I><FONT color=brown>Vapid</FONT></I>, on the other hand, might be thought more pertinent to describing a whole personality, one of limited mentality: a <I><FONT color=brown>vapid</FONT></I> starlet who kept making <I><FONT color=brown>insipid</FONT></I> remarks about the weather. Vapid, when it describes behaviour rather than character, often suggests patent insincerity: thanking him with a <I><FONT color=brown>vapid</FONT></I> smile.</P><P>Unlike the foregoing, <B><FONT color=blue>jejune</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>inane</FONT></B> are less concerned with something that has lost its freshness than with something that reveals a total lack of substance to begin with. <I><FONT color=brown>Jejune</FONT></I> derives from a Latin word meaning hungry and applies emphatically to what is worthless and uninteresting. [This play cannot be called <I><FONT color=brown>banal</FONT></I>, considering its novelty, nor <I><FONT color=brown>insipid</FONT></I>, considering its liveliness, nor <I><FONT color=brown>vapid</FONT></I>, considering its sensitivity; nevertheless, it is utterly unstimulating and <I><FONT color=brown>jejune</FONT></I> in every particular.] <I><FONT color=brown>Inane</FONT></I> derives from a word meaning empty and refers to something that is regarded as worthless because it lack sense to the point of becoming foolish or silly: attempts at flattery that would be laughable if they weren’t so <I><FONT color=brown>inane</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Jejune</FONT></I> can also suggest an enduring state of mental exhaustion or emptiness: grimly resigning herself to the <I><FONT color=brown>jejune</FONT></I> patterns of suburban living. Because of confusion with <I><FONT color=brown>jejune</FONT></I>, the French word for young, the word is also used disapprovingly to indicate immaturity or naïvetè: <I><FONT color=brown>jejune</FONT></I> teen-age fads. Fatuous is an intensification of inane in that it adds a suggestion of self-contented smugness to the silliness suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>inane</FONT></I>: a fatuous grin that revealed how witty she imagined her inane remark to be.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Monotonous">MONOTONOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Sentimental">SENTIMENTAL</A>, <A href="entry://Superficial">SUPERFICIAL</A>, <A href="entry://Trite">TRITE</A>, <A href="entry://Truism">TRUISM</A>.</P><P>ANYONYMS: meaningful, <A href="entry://Significant">SIGNIFICANT</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>bare</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>naked</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>nude</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stripped</FONT></B>:

<P>These words mean devoid of clothing or of a usual covering. <B><FONT color=blue>Bare</FONT></B>, when applied to objects, means without covering or ornament: a <I><FONT color=brown>bare</FONT></I> outcropping of rock; a tree <I><FONT color=brown>bare</FONT></I> of leaves. When used of a person, <I><FONT color=brown>bare</FONT></I> usually applies to a part of the body rather than to the entire body: <I><FONT color=brown>bare</FONT></I> knees; <I><FONT color=brown>bare</FONT></I> arms and legs. By extension it is also used to indicate the omission of fancy trappings or non-essential adjuncts: Just give us the <I><FONT color=brown>bare</FONT></I> facts, without embellishment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Naked</FONT></B>, when applied to a person, means completely devoid of clothing. <I><FONT color=brown>Naked</FONT></I> is often invested with moral or emotional connotations, and may suggest sexual excitation or exhibitionism. [The hotel fire caught them both naked; She couldn’t wear bikinis because the made her feel <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I>.] In other contexts, <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I> may suggest purity or innocence or simply be a neutral description: <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I> nymphs; <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I> children frolicking in the street; The body was <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I> when discovered. In the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>bare</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I> is also used about physical objects or forces generally for poetic effect or for emphasis: <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I> boughs; <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I> power; the <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I> truth.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Nude</FONT></B> applies only to persons and may be neutral in connotation by itself, but its context ?sexual interest being what it is in modern society ?often makes it highly charged with emotional feeling. The noun <I><FONT color=brown>nude</FONT></I> denotes an unclothed figure in painting or sculpture and the association of the word with aesthetic appreciation often invests it with a kind of glamorous appeal lacking in <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Nude</FONT></I> has a more respectable tone than <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I>; thus fashion writers can advertise some feminine clothing as having a <I><FONT color=brown>nude</FONT></I> look but dare not call it <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I>. For the same reason one speaks of sleeping in the <I><FONT color=brown>nude</FONT></I>, never <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stripped</FONT></B> literally means having been rendered <I><FONT color=brown>bare</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>naked</FONT></I>, or <I><FONT color=brown>nude</FONT></I> by some outside agency but it is often used figuratively to mean deprived: <I><FONT color=brown>stripped</FONT></I> of his medals for disobeying a commanding officer; <I><FONT color=brown>stripped</FONT></I> of all his privileges pending an official investigation.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: clothed, covered, dressed.</P>

<P>These words are concerned with concepts of totality and completeness or of necessity. <B><FONT color=blue>Basic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>fundamental</FONT></B> suggest first principles that underlie more complex considerations. <I><FONT color=brown>Fundamental</FONT></I> is the more formal of the two and is more natural in a philosophical context when applied to the principles themselves: a <I><FONT color=brown>fundamental</FONT></I> truth. In an educational context, it strongly suggests something that is indispensable or a pre-requisite to more advanced development: reading as a <I><FONT color=brown>fundamental</FONT></I> skill. While <I><FONT color=brown>fundamental</FONT></I> often points to what is ideally necessary, <I><FONT color=brown>basic</FONT></I> may point to what is actually the case. [Lacking the <I><FONT color=brown>fundamental</FONT></I> ability to make distinctions, their <I><FONT color=brown>basic</FONT></I> vocabulary was greatly reduced.] <I><FONT color=brown>Basic</FONT></I> also has a wider range of application: the <I><FONT color=brown>basic</FONT></I> black of women’s evening dress; a <I><FONT color=brown>basic</FONT></I> distrust of strangers. In these cases, the word may suggest not what in necessary but what is accepted or standard.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Absolute</FONT></B> in one sense is used simply as an intensification of basic: an <I><FONT color=brown>absolute</FONT></I> dislike of women. <I><FONT color=brown>Absolute</FONT></I>, however, relates philosophically to <B><FONT color=blue>ultimate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>categorical</FONT></B> in another sense. Here, it refers to totality of power. Where <I><FONT color=brown>fundamental</FONT></I> indicates an initial necessity, absolute suggests final and conclusive authority: The child’s <I><FONT color=brown>fundamental</FONT></I> instinct towards co-operation was over-ruled by the <I><FONT color=brown>absolute</FONT></I> value the tribe placed upon competition. <I><FONT color=brown>Ultimate</FONT></I> also suggests the highest or final authority: the <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> court of appeal. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>absolute</FONT></I>, it carries an implication of something worked through in time: What our <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> view of the universe will be no one can say. <B><FONT color=blue>Unlimited</FONT></B>, while suggesting totality, contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> in relating more often to quantity than to time: <I><FONT color=brown>unlimited</FONT></I> profits. It compares to <I><FONT color=brown>absolute</FONT></I> in suggesting less a highest authority than one to which no opposition exists. [The king’s powers were <I><FONT color=brown>absolute</FONT></I> but hardly <I><FONT color=brown>unlimited</FONT></I>, considering the strictures of canon and common law.] <I><FONT color=brown>Categorical</FONT></I> in its philosophical sense refers to something, usually a principle, which is inescapable, undeniable and universal. Like <I><FONT color=brown>fundamental</FONT></I>, it suggests an ideal necessity; like <I><FONT color=brown>absolute</FONT></I>, it suggests finality and totality. [The <I><FONT color=brown>categorical</FONT></I> imperative of Kant was a moral truth that the structure of the universe made inevitable.] </P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Centre">CENTRE</A>, <A href="entry://Kernel">KERNEL</A>, <A href="entry://Specific">SPECIFIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: circumscribed, <A href="entry://Marginal">MARGINAL</A>, peripheral, <A href="entry://Provisional">PROVISIONAL</A>, tangent, <A href="entry://Trivial">TRIVIAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to pleasing facial appearances. <B><FONT color=blue>Beautiful</FONT></B> indicates a strikingly desirable or attractive face, suggesting symmetry of features or perfection of proportion, although ultimately the word is dependent on the subjective taste of the user. Because of this it is extremely unspecific in reference, although it would most often be used of a woman’s face. <B><FONT color=blue>Good-looking</FONT></B> is equally as weak in specificity, but it can be used appropriately of both men and women: a <B><FONT color=blue>good-looking</FONT></B> couple.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Handsome</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pretty</FONT></B> are complementary terms in that <I><FONT color=brown>handsome</FONT></I> usually applies to men and <I><FONT color=brown>pretty</FONT></I> even more exclusively to women. <I><FONT color=brown>Pretty</FONT></I>, however, indicates a less elevated or more superficial appeal than <I><FONT color=brown>beautiful</FONT></I>: the rare woman who is truly <I><FONT color=brown>beautiful</FONT></I> as opposed to the many who are merely <I><FONT color=brown>pretty</FONT></I>. In this opposition, <I><FONT color=brown>pretty</FONT></I> might suggest vivacity and sweetness, while <I><FONT color=brown>beautiful</FONT></I> might suggest elegance and nobility. <I><FONT color=brown>Handsome</FONT></I>, used of men, is comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>beautiful</FONT></I>, used of women, suggesting regularity of features and a sturdy manliness. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>handsome</FONT></I> may be used of women as well, in which case it does not, strangely enough, suggest an epicene mannishness, but a radiant force of almost animal good health and vividness: insisting that Garbo was not merely <I><FONT color=brown>beautiful</FONT></I>, but breathtakingly <I><FONT color=brown>handsome</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Handsome</FONT></I> in this sense would be used only of mature women, never of girls. <I><FONT color=brown>Pretty</FONT></I> would never be used of a man, except pejoratively to suggest effeminacy. <I><FONT color=brown>Beautiful</FONT></I> may rarely be used of a man without negative effect; in this case the face is usually regarded in an artistic light or as redolent of some special attribute: a man with <I><FONT color=brown>beautiful</FONT></I> features; a <I><FONT color=brown>beautiful</FONT></I> and expressive face that spoke both of strength and of suffering.</P><P>Because <B><FONT color=blue>comely</FONT></B> may now sound outdated, it is sometimes used to suggest earthy or rustic good looks in women: the <I><FONT color=brown>comely</FONT></I> milkmaid in a Constable painting. Once its particular emphasis, however, was on freedom from blemish, as in the Song of Solomon: "I am black, but comely.?<B><FONT color=blue>Cute</FONT></B> is an informal word for prettiness in women that suggests general attractiveness and cheerfulness; thus it conveys something a little less than <I><FONT color=brown>pretty</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Cute</FONT></I> may also be used by women to describe men who may not be <I><FONT color=brown>handsome</FONT></I> but who are boyish or sweet-tempered. <B><FONT color=blue>Gorgeous</FONT></B> is sometimes used hyperbolically to refer to someone extremely <I><FONT color=brown>beautiful</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>handsome</FONT></I>; like many hyperboles its extravagance has tended to strip it of meaning.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Charming">CHARMING</A>, <A href="entry://Pleasing">PLEASING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Ugly">UGLY</A>, uncomely.</P>

<P>These words refer to the earliest period in a thing’s existence. <B><FONT color=blue>Begin</FONT></B>, the broadest term of this group, means to take the first step or do the first act or part of something: to <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I> a course of study leading to a doctorate; to <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I> to understand one’s past mistakes. In many contexts <B><FONT color=blue>start</FONT></B> is interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I>: The engine <I><FONT color=brown>started</FONT></I> (or began) smoking. But <I><FONT color=brown>start</FONT></I> places more emphasis on the fact of making a beginning, the mere act of setting out, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I> often suggests the start of a process in fulfillment of a purpose. The relationship between <I><FONT color=brown>start</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I> is not unlike that between <I><FONT color=brown>speed</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>velocity</FONT></I>; the second word in both sets implies direction. [He was <I><FONT color=brown>beginning</FONT></I> to think of himself as an old man; She <I><FONT color=brown>started</FONT></I> (or began) skiing last winter; The train <I><FONT color=brown>started</FONT></I> with a lurch.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Commence</FONT></B> is a more formal word for <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I>. There are practically no contexts in which <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I> will not serve very well in place of <I><FONT color=brown>commence</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>commence</FONT></I>, and sometimes <B><FONT color=blue>institute</FONT></B>, is preferred in some context, especially legal, where <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I> is felt to be insufficiently formal, too much an everyday word, to dignify the proceedings. Thus legal action is <I><FONT color=brown>instituted</FONT></I>, rarely begun, and judicial sessions <I><FONT color=brown>commence</FONT></I>, seldom begin. <I><FONT color=brown>Commence</FONT></I> is sometimes used vulgarly or humorously in other than solemn contexts: We <I><FONT color=brown>commenced</FONT></I> to drink our beer. <I><FONT color=brown>Institute</FONT></I> in other senses means to begin with a view towards setting up or putting into operation: to <I><FONT color=brown>institute</FONT></I> needed reforms in the ministry. <I><FONT color=brown>Institute</FONT></I> suggests a great deal of enterprise, and frequently foresight as well: to <I><FONT color=brown>institute</FONT></I> new management methods that saved millions of dollars.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Initiate</FONT></B> is close to institute in pointing to the motivating force or creator that <I><FONT color=brown>starts</FONT></I> something, but does not, like <I><FONT color=brown>institute</FONT></I>, convey the idea of carrying through what one has <I><FONT color=brown>started</FONT></I> to the point of seeing it in operation: to <I><FONT color=brown>initiate</FONT></I> legislation; He <I><FONT color=brown>initiated</FONT></I> the reforms, but the government agency <I><FONT color=brown>instituted</FONT></I> them.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inaugurate</FONT></B> means to begin formally or officially. Thus to <I><FONT color=brown>inaugurate</FONT></I> a new policy or legislation suggests some ceremony or traditional observance to commemorate it. [Once a president is <I><FONT color=brown>inaugurated</FONT></I>, he <I><FONT color=brown>begins</FONT></I> his term of office; The ball was <I><FONT color=brown>inaugurated</FONT></I> by the introduction to society of several young debutantes.] The word is also used for <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I> in historical contexts implying great scope or import: The Industrial Revolution <I><FONT color=brown>inaugurated</FONT></I> a new era.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Launch</FONT></B> is a related word, but means to <I><FONT color=brown>begin</FONT></I> not so much with ceremony as with fanfare and publicity. [The Treasury is <I><FONT color=brown>launching</FONT></I> a new government loan; The advertising agency will <I><FONT color=brown>launch</FONT></I> a campaign to introduce a new soap.] This sense doubtless derives from the fanfare attached to the <I><FONT color=brown>launching</FONT></I> of large sea-going vessels.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Origin">ORIGIN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Finish">FINISH</A>, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to someone who has not yet acquired the skills and experience that are required to qualify him in a given field. <B><FONT color=blue>Beginner</FONT></B> is the most informal of these words and is the least negative in tone, suggesting someone who has already started to acquire the necessary abilities but has not worked long enough to master them; the word may imply a young person, but this is not necessarily so: a ballet class for adult <I><FONT color=brown>beginners</FONT></I>; piano lessons for children and <I><FONT color=brown>beginners</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Apprentice</FONT></B> most concretely refers to a young person taken on by a master to be taught the skills of a trade: the <I><FONT color=brown>apprentice</FONT></I> who becomes a qualified tradesman. In broader uses, the word refers to any beginner, often with an emphasis on his low or menial position or lack of polish: a writer whose first book reveals him to be an <I><FONT color=brown>apprentice</FONT></I> rather than a mature artist.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>novice</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>neophyte</FONT></B>, but especially the former, may refer to a newly introduced member of a religious order. In broader contexts, both are less factual and more uncomplimentary. <I><FONT color=brown>Novice</FONT></I> in this case may suggest clumsiness due to lack of training or even to an <I><FONT color=brown>amateurish</FONT></I> lack of discipline or application: light meters made so that even the rankest <I><FONT color=brown>novice</FONT></I> can use them; a <I><FONT color=brown>novice</FONT></I> whose canvases show the lowest possible standards and the worst set of influences. <I><FONT color=brown>Neophyte</FONT></I> may be used somewhat less negatively than <I><FONT color=brown>novice</FONT></I>, especially since it implies an eagerness to learn and a humble respect for an seeking out of knowledgeable authority: the <I><FONT color=brown>neophytes</FONT></I> who clustered around the established poet in hopes of catching some pearl of wisdom he seemed always on the verge of dropping.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tyro</FONT></B> (also tiro) is perhaps the most negative of these words in that it refers to an inexperienced and <I><FONT color=brown>amateurish</FONT></I> approach to a complicated field, suggesting a raw or young recruit who has yet to begin the task of mastering his craft: the <I><FONT color=brown>tyro</FONT></I> who has taken one or two survey courses in literature and proceeds to write critical reviews for his school paper.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Amateur">AMATEUR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: connoisseur, expert, old hand, old-timer, veteran, virtuoso.</P>

<P>These words are used to refer to things that are in the initial or early stage of existence or to things that are unformed, undeveloped or elementary in character. <B><FONT color=blue>Beginning</FONT></B>, the most general of the five, can mean either first or early. The <I><FONT color=brown>beginning</FONT></I> chapter of a book is its first chapter; the <I><FONT color=brown>beginning</FONT></I> section of the same book would embrace the first chapter but would also include several of the other early chapters. In another sense, <I><FONT color=brown>beginning</FONT></I> describes something that deals with elementary principles, skills or routines: The <I><FONT color=brown>beginning</FONT></I> course in physics will not be offered this term.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Incipient</FONT></B> shares with beginning the meaning of just coming into existence: The <I><FONT color=brown>incipient</FONT></I> stage of a urinary infection is often marked by high fever. <B><FONT color=blue>Inchoate</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>beginning</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>incipient</FONT></I>, can describe a condition or activity that has just recently come into existence or operation. It more often suggests the absence of order, form or coherence: an <I><FONT color=brown>inchoate</FONT></I> plan, badly organized and full of contradictions. One of the general meanings of <I><FONT color=brown>inchoate</FONT></I>, that referring to a lack of completion or perfection, is part of the specialized terminology of the legal profession. An <I><FONT color=brown>inchoate</FONT></I> contract is one that has not been executed by all the parties involved.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rudimentary</FONT></B>, which means fundamental or elementary, is often used to express a limitation: He had only a <I><FONT color=brown>rudimentary</FONT></I> knowledge of chemistry. It also can characterize something as primitive, undeveloped or imperfectly developed. [Their dwelling place was <I><FONT color=brown>rudimentary</FONT></I> in nature, rather more like a hut than a house; A pair of <I><FONT color=brown>rudimentary</FONT></I> hind legs are part of the skeleton of the boa constrictor.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Primeval</FONT></B> refers to the earliest ages of the world, particularly to that time before the appearance of man on earth: the <I><FONT color=brown>primeval</FONT></I> forests of Europe. It is applied by extension to tings that are very old and have existed since time immemorial: <I><FONT color=brown>primeval</FONT></I> rocks.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Begin">BEGIN</A>.</P><P>ANYONYMS: closing, developed, ending, late, <A href="entry://Mature">MATURE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the characteristic ways that people reveal themselves in their actions. <B><FONT color=blue>Behaviour</FONT></B> is the most general of these; at its most technical, it refers to all activity of people, singly or collectively, that might be studied by psychologists, sociologists or anthropologists: paranoid <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I>; peer-group <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I> in preschool children; mating <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I> in New Guinea. In everyday use, the word more frequently refers to positive or negative social activity: promising to be on my best <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I>; such incredibly rude <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Conduct</FONT></B> can also refer to individual or group activity, but in a less technical sense than <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I>; it also may be categorized positively or negatively. It does suggest a narrower range of activity than <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I>, implying the breaking or following of prescribed rules: a <I><FONT color=brown>bad-conduct</FONT></I> discharge from the army; a prison sentence commuted for good <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I>. The word is distinct from these other words because it may suggest an ethical or moral basis for measuring <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I> befitting an honest man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Manners</FONT></B> refers not so much to adherence to ethical standards as to the arbitrary forms by which a social group has traditionally acted. Here a positive or negative evaluation may depend on subjective taste as much as anything else: the vulgar <I><FONT color=brown>manners</FONT></I> of the nouveau riche; the easy, natural <I><FONT color=brown>manners</FONT></I> that were second nature to her. The word most often refers to individuals, but can sometimes apply collectively to a whole social group: the affected <I><FONT color=brown>manners</FONT></I> of our debased age.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deportment</FONT></B> is a more formal synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I>, but the set of rules that measure <I><FONT color=brown>deportment</FONT></I> may be arbitrary choices to facilitate a goal or may be superimposed from above, instigated especially to instil a respect for authority. It refers also to <I><FONT color=brown>manner</FONT></I> of bearing, carriage and address as well as to general <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I>. A common use is to describe the <I><FONT color=brown>behaviour</FONT></I> of pupils in school: sending home remarks critical of his uncooperative <I><FONT color=brown>deportment</FONT></I>; measures to improve the <I><FONT color=brown>deportment</FONT></I> of her class. <B><FONT color=blue>Demeanour</FONT></B> is distinct from all these words in that it almost exclusively refers to the way a particular person acts at a particular time, and suggests an assessment of the person’s dress, bearing, attitude and expression: a habitually quiet man who had never shown such an agitated <I><FONT color=brown>demeanour</FONT></I>: a supervisor known for her invariably soft-spoken and relaxed <I><FONT color=brown>demeanour</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Act">ACT</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to harass or torment, another person so persistently as to disturb his peace of mind or undermine his self-confidence. <B><FONT color=blue>Beleaguer</FONT></B>, from its literal meaning of surrounding and shutting in an enemy force with one’s own army, carries the implication of a hemming in on all sides by a multitude, so that escape is virtually impossible: a landlord <I><FONT color=brown>beleaguered</FONT></I> by complaining tenants; a man <I><FONT color=brown>beleaguered</FONT></I> by worries; a countryside <I><FONT color=brown>beleaguered</FONT></I> by a plague of locusts.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hound</FONT></B> strongly suggests the relentless and unflagging pursuit of a hunting dog on the scent: an escaped criminal <I><FONT color=brown>hounded</FONT></I> from city to city by police. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>hound</FONT></I> also implies repeated urging, especially to the point where the victim can do little except submit: to be <I><FONT color=brown>hounded</FONT></I> by bill collectors; a teacher <I><FONT color=brown>hounded</FONT></I> from his job because of his political views.</P><P>The literal meaning of <B><FONT color=blue>bait</FONT></B> is to set dogs for sport on a chained or penned animal, especially a bear or a bull. Figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>bait</FONT></I> implies malicious pleasure in tormenting another by teasing and ridicule, especially when retaliation is difficult: <I><FONT color=brown>baited</FONT></I> by the other boys at school for his poor showing in sports; to <I><FONT color=brown>bait</FONT></I> an old man whose ideas are not in agreement with yours. <I><FONT color=brown>Bait</FONT></I> may also mean to tease or twit in a more or less amiable way: He <I><FONT color=brown>baited</FONT></I> his wife for spending so much time talking on the telephone.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ride</FONT></B>, which is chiefly colloquial, evokes the action of urging a mount on to greater speed by the use of spurs or a whip. Therefore, <I><FONT color=brown>ride</FONT></I> may imply driving or goading someone to reach a goal (not necessarily an undesirable one), but often suggests mischievous or malicious intent. [Parents complain that the fifth-grade teacher <I><FONT color=brown>rides</FONT></I> her brighter pupils too hard; The boys at the office are always <I><FONT color=brown>riding</FONT></I> me because my wife calls me at five o’clock sharp every day to make sure I’m coming straight home.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Heckle</FONT></B> emphasizes the harassing of a speaker in public by means of taunts, questions, and other interruptions in order to confuse or intimidate him or to ferret out the weaknesses in his argument: to <I><FONT color=brown>heckle</FONT></I> a candidate for political office; to <I><FONT color=brown>heckle</FONT></I> the leader of an anti-war demonstration.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hector</FONT></B> strongly suggests bullying and browbeating by scolding or derision: an authoritarian father who <I><FONT color=brown>hectors</FONT></I> his children instead of trying to understand them; a warder who keeps order by <I><FONT color=brown>hectoring</FONT></I> his prisoners.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Intimidate">INTIMIDATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>believable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>convincing</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>credible</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>plausible</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all mean capable of being believed or worthy of being accepted as real, true or trustworthy. <B><FONT color=blue>Believable</FONT></B> is the most general term and describes anything that is possible, probable or acceptable either because it is in accordance with one’s everyday experience and observation or because it is not directly contrary to fact. [He gave us a frightening, but <I><FONT color=brown>believable</FONT></I>, account of his childhood in the slums; The boy’s tale of meeting a pirate on the deserted beach is simply not <I><FONT color=brown>believable</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Credible</FONT></B> is sometimes used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>believable</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>believable</FONT></I> excuse for his lateness; a <I><FONT color=brown>credible</FONT></I> explanation for having failed to finish his work. However, <I><FONT color=brown>credible</FONT></I> goes a step beyond <I><FONT color=brown>believable</FONT></I> in that something that is <I><FONT color=brown>credible</FONT></I> merits belief and is supported by known facts: a <I><FONT color=brown>credible</FONT></I> account of the causes of World War II. <I><FONT color=brown>Credible</FONT></I> is now rarely used of persons except in the expression <I><FONT color=brown>credible witness</FONT></I> ?that is, a witness who is reliable and trustworthy in giving accurate testimony.</P><P>Something that is <B><FONT color=blue>convincing</FONT></B> is <I><FONT color=brown>believable</FONT></I> because it overcomes any doubt, uncertainty, or hesitancy in accepting it. A <I><FONT color=brown>convincing</FONT></I> argument compels one’s belief in its soundness because it satisfies the sense of logic or fitness.</P><P>The earlier meaning of <B><FONT color=blue>plausible</FONT></B> adhered closely to its etymology, "worthy of <I><FONT color=brown>applause</FONT></I>" ?that is, commendable or capable of winning favourable acceptance by the mind.

<P>These words refer to criticism designed to diminish the worth of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Belittle</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of these; it may suggest a deliberately fault-finding attitude: <I><FONT color=brown>belittle</FONT></I> every practical suggestion she came up with. It may imply an attitude that simply cannot tolerate excellence or effort in others: <I><FONT color=brown>belittling</FONT></I> those who had continued to work on the project after he had given up. It may also suggest a cumulatively telling process of slight or trivial attempts to undermine another’s position: constantly <I><FONT color=brown>belittling</FONT></I> everything he believed in.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Minimize</FONT></B> is a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>belittle</FONT></I>: it refers specifically to the attempt to set a lower value on something than it commonly carries or deserves: <I><FONT color=brown>minimizing</FONT></I> the worth of civil defence measures previously in force. In contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>belittle</FONT></I>, any not of spiteful censoriousness may be absent from this word, which by its formality may emphasize, instead, a judicious or reasoned reassessment: <I><FONT color=brown>minimizing</FONT></I> the effect of Augustine on later medieval thought. The sense of animus, by contrast, is definitely present in detract, even to a greater degree than in <I><FONT color=brown>belittle</FONT></I>. Where <I><FONT color=brown>belittle</FONT></I>, furthermore, may suggest a sniping at trivial failings, detract suggests an attempt at a more drastic lowering of esteem: a fiercely argued view that sought to detract from the usefulness of the earlier study.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disparage</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>deprecate</FONT></B> contrast with the foregoing words by suggesting a general effort to make something seem without worth or value. <I><FONT color=brown>Disparage</FONT></I> suggests the animus of detract, but may imply a seizing caustically <I><FONT color=brown>disparaging</FONT></I> each new production as further proof of the playwright’s worthlessness, while <I><FONT color=brown>deprecate</FONT></I> may sometimes suggest only an attempt to devalue rather than to reject something utterly, its effect is strengthened by the amused, scornful, or sarcastic consideration it implies: <I><FONT color=brown>deprecating</FONT></I> the notion of a take-over with a weary laugh. <I><FONT color=brown>Depreciate</FONT></I> is mainly used intransitively, meaning to fall in value, but some purists assert that <I><FONT color=brown>depreciate</FONT></I> and not <I><FONT color=brown>deprecate</FONT></I> should be used in the sense of lowering or underestimating the worth of: the tendency of people who are not talented to <I><FONT color=brown>depreciate</FONT></I> those who are.

<P>These words all refer to a voice raised in excitement or urgency. Although each word suggests most readily a particular emotion, all have been used interchangeable to pertain to any expression of intense feeling: joy, anger, pain, grief, despair, amazement, resentment and many others. All of them, furthermore, pertain to one person’s tone of voice, but are commonly used for groups of people when one wishes to suggest that the group responds almost unanimously to some event with a single reaction.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cry</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>shout</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>yell</FONT></B> are the most general, emphasizing mainly the loudness of a voice or voices: a <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I> of delight; a tortured <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>shout</FONT></I> of approval that rang through the hall; a <I><FONT color=brown>yell</FONT></I> for help. <I><FONT color=brown>Cry</FONT></I> particularly suggests a surprised or involuntary response. In an informal context, however, <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I> is especially associated with emotions that result in tears; the woman who sat down and had a good <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I>. This informal use is sometimes present as an overtone in other uses of the word: watching him leave and <I><FONT color=brown>crying</FONT></I> for him to come back. <I><FONT color=brown>Yell</FONT></I> is especially relevant to a situation in which someone is calling for help: hoping their <I><FONT color=brown>yells</FONT></I> would carry far enough to be heard. <I><FONT color=brown>Yell</FONT></I> also has a particular use of cries of enthusiasm at sports event, either spontaneous or planned: supporters who urged on their team with a concerted <I><FONT color=brown>yell</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>yells</FONT></I> of "Murder him" that echoed above the boxing ring. <I><FONT color=brown>Shout</FONT></I> can related to the situation of seeking help, but is also pertains particularly to the emotion of anger: an apoplectic <I><FONT color=brown>shout</FONT></I> from her husband that rang through the café.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bellow</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>roar</FONT></B> relate to this aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>shout</FONT></I> in being most appropriate for angry <I><FONT color=brown>cries</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Bellow</FONT></I> suggests deepness of voice as well as loudness and thus implies a man’s voice or a group dominated by men; it is also used for enraged animals, such as an angered bull: the platoon sergeant’s <I><FONT color=brown>bellow</FONT></I> of disgust; a furious <I><FONT color=brown>bellow</FONT></I> from the wounded bull. <I><FONT color=brown>Roar</FONT></I> also suggests anger when it refers to a single person, but it is especially appropriate need not necessarily be that of unanimous anger, but of a mingling of diverse emotions: the <I><FONT color=brown>roar</FONT></I> of praise and disapproval that swelled through the theatre. <I><FONT color=brown>Roar</FONT></I> can, of course, also refer to any loud mingling of noises, neither human nor animal: the <I><FONT color=brown>roar</FONT></I> of the printing presses.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shriek</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scream</FONT></B> refer most appropriately to <I><FONT color=brown>cries</FONT></I> of pain, terror or surprise: the <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I> of a woman trapped under piles of debris. In sharp contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>bellow</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I> suggests high-pitched sound, discordant, grating or whining: The woman’s <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I> of terror carried farther than the man’s enraged <I><FONT color=brown>bellow</FONT></I>. Because of this implication, <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I> is sometimes used of birds: the <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I> of gulls above the harbour. Like <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>scream</FONT></I> often implies a high-pitched, piercing sound: the <I><FONT color=brown>scream</FONT></I> of a siren. But it emphasizes loudness more than pitch, and more often than shriek may apply to hysterical or panicky shouts of men as well as women: Clutching his crushed foot, he let out a <I><FONT color=brown>scream</FONT></I> of pain. Both <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>scream</FONT></I> may be used hyperbolically in situations suggesting intense surprise: When she opened the present she gave a little <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I> of joy; a <I><FONT color=brown>scream</FONT></I> of delight. And both are commonly used to describe the shouts of children.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Outcry</FONT></B> relates to <I><FONT color=brown>shriek</FONT></I> as it pertains to cries of pain. But its most specific use is for an outburst of indignation, usually from a group of people: neighbours who watched the murder but made no <I><FONT color=brown>outcry</FONT></I>. The sense of protest is present even in metaphorical uses: newspaper editorials that cause a public <I><FONT color=brown>outcry</FONT></I> against such indifference.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chatter">CHATTER</A>, <A href="entry://Say">SAY</A>, <A href="entry://Squeal">SQUEAL</A>.</P>

<P>These verbs are applied to bodily movements and denote a change from a straight, natural, or fixed position. <B><FONT color=blue>Bend</FONT></B> implies a folding movement of the head or body or an angular movement at a joint: to <I><FONT color=brown>bend</FONT></I> from the waist; to <I><FONT color=brown>bend</FONT></I> the elbow. <B><FONT color=blue>Lean</FONT></B> refers to a sloping movement away from an erect position.

[<I><FONT color=brown>Lean</FONT></I> back and relax; <I><FONT color=brown>Lean</FONT></I> your head on my shoulder; He <I><FONT color=brown>leaned</FONT></I> against the wall.] When <I><FONT color=brown>bend</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>lean</FONT></I> are close in meaning, bend suggests a more marked downward movement and implies greater effort, force or concentration. [The clerk <I><FONT color=brown>leaned</FONT></I> over the counter; the student <I><FONT color=brown>bent</FONT></I> over his books.]</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>bow</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>bend</FONT></I> the head or upper body forwards and down: to <I><FONT color=brown>bend</FONT></I> over backwards; to <I><FONT color=brown>lean</FONT></I> sideways; to <I><FONT color=brown>bow</FONT></I> before the king. <I><FONT color=brown>Bowing</FONT></I> is a formal action, done for a symbolic rather than a practical purpose.] <I><FONT color=brown>Bend</FONT></I> down and pick it up; <I><FONT color=brown>Bow</FONT></I> down and worship.] One may <I><FONT color=brown>bow</FONT></I> to show reverence, respect, humility or submission: to <I><FONT color=brown>bow</FONT></I> before an altar; to <I><FONT color=brown>bow</FONT></I> the head and <I><FONT color=brown>bend</FONT></I> the knee in prayer. Or one may bow as a matter of custom, formal courtesy or protocol: to <I><FONT color=brown>bow</FONT></I> to one’s audience after performing; a <I><FONT color=brown>bowing</FONT></I> headwaiter; <I><FONT color=brown>bowing</FONT></I> diplomats. In <I><FONT color=brown>bending</FONT></I> over, <I><FONT color=brown>leaning</FONT></I> down or <I><FONT color=brown>bowing</FONT></I> from the waist, one lowers the body by <I><FONT color=brown>bending</FONT></I> the back.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>stoop</FONT></B> is to lower the body by <I><FONT color=brown>bending</FONT></I> the knees: He <I><FONT color=brown>stooped</FONT></I> down to talk to the child on the child’s own level. Posture experts prefer <I><FONT color=brown>stooping</FONT></I> to <I><FONT color=brown>bending</FONT></I> because, in <I><FONT color=brown>stooping</FONT></I>, the head and torso remain upright and no strain is put on the back.

It implies rotation of the head or body and refers to a change in direction. [<I><FONT color=brown>Turn</FONT></I> to the left; He <I><FONT color=brown>turned</FONT></I> his head to look behind him; She <I><FONT color=brown>turned</FONT></I> to face me; <I><FONT color=brown>Turn</FONT></I> over; <I><FONT color=brown>Turn</FONT></I> round; They <I><FONT color=brown>turned</FONT></I> the patient on his side.] In a special sense, <I><FONT color=brown>turn</FONT></I> may describe a sudden inward collapse or outward wrenching of the ankle that results in a strain or sprain: She stumbled at the kerb and <I><FONT color=brown>turned</FONT></I> her ankle. <B><FONT color=blue>Twist</FONT></B> indicates a strained, contorted, or violent <I><FONT color=brown>turning</FONT></I> of part of the body. It suggests the muscular tension set up when one part of the body changes position while the rest remains in place. [She <I><FONT color=brown>twisted</FONT></I> round in her seat, craning backwards; He <I><FONT color=brown>twisted</FONT></I> my arm.] <I><FONT color=brown>Twisting</FONT></I> may also involve a sinuous <I><FONT color=brown>bending</FONT></I> or winding: to <I><FONT color=brown>twist</FONT></I> one’s legs round a chair. Or it may suggest a constant, restless <I><FONT color=brown>turning</FONT></I> or squirming: He <I><FONT color=brown>twisted</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>turned</FONT></I> all night.</P><P>All these words may be used in figurative senses. <I><FONT color=brown>Bend</FONT></I> stresses force or flexibility, the power to subdue or the facility to yield, adapt or change: stern and unbending. [The <I><FONT color=brown>bent</FONT></I> to his wishes; He <I><FONT color=brown>bent</FONT></I> (or bowed) them to his will. <I><FONT color=brown>Bow</FONT></I> may imply a submissive yielding suggestive of a broken or servile spirit: <I><FONT color=brown>bowed</FONT></I> down by heavy sorrows; bloody but <I><FONT color=brown>unbowed</FONT></I>; to <I><FONT color=brown>bow</FONT></I> and scrape. <I><FONT color=brown>Stoop</FONT></I> emphasizes the idea of lowering oneself by doing something that one deems degrading: I would not <I><FONT color=brown>stoop</FONT></I> to such methods. <I><FONT color=brown>Lean</FONT></I> stresses the idea of inclination, a sympathy of views that draws one in a certain direction: a moderate who <I><FONT color=brown>leans</FONT></I> toward conservatism. <I><FONT color=brown>Turn</FONT></I> calls to mind a whirling rotation. It may be used of something that makes a person giddy or that causes him to lose his sense of proportion: Compliments <I><FONT color=brown>turned</FONT></I> her head. <I><FONT color=brown>Twist</FONT></I> implies a violent <I><FONT color=brown>turning</FONT></I> out of the natural course and may connote distortion or deformity: to <I><FONT color=brown>twist</FONT></I> someone’s words; a <I><FONT color=brown>twisted</FONT></I> mind.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Rotate">ROTATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: rise, straighten.</P>

<P>These words describe conditions that are positive in their effect on health or financial well-being. <B><FONT color=blue>Beneficial</FONT></B> is general and relatively formal. While it can refer to financial well-being, it more naturally applies to things conductive to mental or physical health: government programmes <I><FONT color=brown>beneficial</FONT></I> to the poor; a sunny day’s <I><FONT color=brown>beneficial</FONT></I> influence on my darkest moods; milk and vegetables <I><FONT color=brown>beneficial</FONT></I> to a growing child. In one sense, it suggests something that is an added help, but is not strictly necessary: a friendship <I><FONT color=brown>beneficial</FONT></I> to both of them. <B><FONT color=blue>Good</FONT></B> is, of course, the most general word here and the least formal; it has a multitude of uses in pointing to what promotes financial or physical strength: a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> climate; <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> circulation; a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> business proposal; a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> stock. Its very generality invites the substitution of a more precise synonym.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Advantageous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>profitable</FONT></B> are words which carry overtones of financial well-being. <I><FONT color=brown>Advantageous</FONT></I> can, of course, refer to anything chosen for its desirability or to improve one’s situation: a more <I><FONT color=brown>advantageous</FONT></I> view of the sunset; resorts <I><FONT color=brown>advantageous</FONT></I> to the husband-hunting secretary. More often, an actual monetary gain is present or implied: an <I><FONT color=brown>advantageous</FONT></I> position in his firm. <I><FONT color=brown>Profitable</FONT></I> is even clearer on this score: a <I><FONT color=brown>profitable</FONT></I> business in a <I><FONT color=brown>profitable</FONT></I> location; Good looks are a more <I><FONT color=brown>profitable</FONT></I> commodity in Hollywood than talent and hard work. In Victorian times, <I><FONT color=brown>profitable</FONT></I> was often used for something <I><FONT color=brown>beneficial</FONT></I> to the development of character: a <I><FONT color=brown>profitable</FONT></I> book to read for spiritual guidance. This use is less frequent today.</P><P>The rest of these words relate more specifically to the promoting of health. <B><FONT color=blue>Healthful</FONT></B> is now fairly restricted in its use. When it is employed it refers to what will give good health or what is conducive to it: the <I><FONT color=brown>healthful</FONT></I> properties of certain foods. On most occasions the term <B><FONT color=blue>healthy</FONT></B> is used, and one has to determine from context whether it means the state of possessing health (see under HEALTHY) or what will give health. Thus the ailing person is concerned with <I><FONT color=brown>healthy</FONT></I> climates and <I><FONT color=brown>healthy</FONT></I> foods, while both he and the <I><FONT color=brown>healthy</FONT></I> person appreciate <I><FONT color=brown>healthy</FONT></I> exercise and <I><FONT color=brown>healthy</FONT></I> activities. <B><FONT color=blue>Wholesome</FONT></B> suggests less the promoting of well-being than the inherently <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>healthy</FONT></I> situation in and for itself. It also carries a tone of moral uplift and is as often used of mental as of physical health: a <I><FONT color=brown>wholesome</FONT></I> film for the whole family; <I><FONT color=brown>wholesome</FONT></I> food; <I><FONT color=brown>wholesome</FONT></I> good looks. Its overtones become clear when on considers that some <I><FONT color=brown>healthy</FONT></I> activities might decidedly not be considered <I><FONT color=brown>wholesome</FONT></I> in many situations.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Salutary</FONT></B> suggests the correcting of a physical or mental lack: a <I><FONT color=brown>salutary</FONT></I> diet for anemia; sea breezes <I><FONT color=brown>salutary</FONT></I> to insomniacs; an editorial <I><FONT color=brown>salutary</FONT></I> in its fierce honesty and forthright proposals. <B><FONT color=blue>Salubrious</FONT></B> is comparable to but more intense than <I><FONT color=brown>salutary</FONT></I>, suggesting a positive physical or mental enrichment, without suggesting any previous impoverishment. It also describes any invigorating or stimulating experience: the <I><FONT color=brown>salubrious</FONT></I> mineral waters of the spa; the <I><FONT color=brown>salubrious</FONT></I> effects of a long ocean voyage; a <I><FONT color=brown>salubrious</FONT></I> shock to the complacent middle-classes.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Favourable">FAVOURABLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bad, detrimental, disadvantageous, harmful, injurious, insalubrious, ruinous, unhealthful, unhelpful, unprofitable, unwholesome.</P>

<P>These words refer to some desirable good that can be given, acquired or earned. <B><FONT color=blue>Benefit</FONT></B> is the most general of these, referring to any kind of good, however, acquired, material or otherwise: lessons designed to be of <I><FONT color=brown>benefit</FONT></I> to growing minds; the <I><FONT color=brown>benefits</FONT></I> accorded to one of his lofty position. <B><FONT color=blue>Advantage</FONT></B> is narrower in scope than <I><FONT color=brown>benefit</FONT></I>, since it can suggest more strictly either material <I><FONT color=brown>benefits</FONT></I> or things won in competition against an opponent: all the <I><FONT color=brown>advantages</FONT></I> of suburban living; a naturally fortified hill that would give them the <I><FONT color=brown>advantage</FONT></I> over the enemy. The word, or course, can function more abstractly and without any implication of depriving someone else of the same <I><FONT color=brown>benefit</FONT></I>: all equally free to take <I><FONT color=brown>advantages</FONT></I> of our tradition of free speech and respect for dissent. <B><FONT color=blue>Favour</FONT></B> may suggest being given the <I><FONT color=brown>advantage</FONT></I> in a competition: ruling in <I><FONT color=brown>favour</FONT></I> of the plaintiff; unequal odds that made the battle sure to come out in the aggressor’s <I><FONT color=brown>favour</FONT></I>. The word, however, most often refers to <I><FONT color=brown>benefits</FONT></I> that result from securing the approval of others: a new product seeking public <I><FONT color=brown>favour</FONT></I>; audiences that looked with <I><FONT color=brown>favour</FONT></I> on his plays. The word can also be used to indicate narrow self-interest: acting only in his own <I><FONT color=brown>favour</FONT></I>.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>benefit</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>gain</FONT></B> can suggest an intangible good given or acquired at no one’s expense: a law that resulted in a clear gain for civil liberties; a <I><FONT color=brown>gain</FONT></I> in technical competence over his last word. More commonly, however, the word suggests material acquisition: capital <I><FONT color=brown>gains</FONT></I>; greedy for <I><FONT color=brown>gain</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Profit</FONT></B> is even more restricted to material or monetary acquisition: realizing a ten-per-cent <I><FONT color=brown>profit</FONT></I> on each sale; speculators eager for a quick <I><FONT color=brown>profit</FONT></I>. Sometimes, however, the word can refer to <I><FONT color=brown>gains</FONT></I> outside the context of money-making: a book anyone can read with <I><FONT color=brown>profit</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Help">HELP</A>, <A href="entry://Improve">IMPROVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: disadvantage, harm, loss.</P>

benevolence
<B><FONT color=blue>benevolence</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>altruism</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>generosity</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>good will</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>kindness</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unselfishness</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a well-wishing friendliness or concern for the needs and desires of other people. <B><FONT color=blue>Benevolence</FONT></B> has the widest range of any of these words, suggesting an expansive and good-humoured tolerance and sympathy for others: brimming over with a feeling of sunny <I><FONT color=brown>benevolence</FONT></I> towards everyone he encountered. Sometimes the word implies the sympathy of a superior towards a subordinate, an implication strengthened by the word’s formality: working conditions sought as a right, not as a <I><FONT color=brown>benevolence</FONT></I> of their employer. <B><FONT color=blue>Generosity</FONT></B> is more informal and focuses exclusively on the aspect of giving, referring to an unstintingly helpful act or habit: the <I><FONT color=brown>generosity</FONT></I> with which he shared his toys with other children. In contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>benevolence</FONT></I>, which may remain an unacted-upon feeling, <I><FONT color=brown>generosity</FONT></I> is measured by actual behaviour: a plantation owner who looked on his native workers with <I><FONT color=brown>benevolence</FONT></I> but could hardly be accused of treating them with <I><FONT color=brown>generosity</FONT></I>.</P><P>At a level of greater in formality, <B><FONT color=blue>good will</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>kindness</FONT></B> are related somewhat like the previous pair, with <I><FONT color=brown>good will</FONT></I> referring primarily to feeling and <I><FONT color=brown>kindness</FONT></I> to action. <I><FONT color=brown>Good will</FONT></I> may refer to an open, charitable attitude, without reservation or bitterness: Christmas carollers full of merriment and <I><FONT color=brown>good will</FONT></I>. The word may also refer to a willingness to be fair-minded or impartial: both sides bargaining in <I><FONT color=brown>good will</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Kindness</FONT></I> may suggest thoughtful or courteous consideration for the feelings of others: neighbour who were always the soul of <I><FONT color=brown>kindness</FONT></I>. Often, however, the word specifically points to the help one person gives to someone less fortunate, less well, or less able than himself: a nurse who treated the sick and wounded with almost reverent <I><FONT color=brown>kindness</FONT></I>. This word, consequently, can sometimes have a patronizing flavour, like <I><FONT color=brown>benevolence</FONT></I>: insisting that he wanted only her <I><FONT color=brown>good will</FONT></I>, not her <I><FONT color=brown>kindness</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unselfishness</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>altruism</FONT></B> both point to a <I><FONT color=brown>generosity</FONT></I> that is based on a lack of self-concern. Where <I><FONT color=brown>generosity</FONT></I> may emphasize the quantity given, possibly for ostentatious reasons, <I><FONT color=brown>unselfishness</FONT></I> stresses the effacing personal sacrifice required ?even if a lesser amount is given: It was the tax deduction involve, rather than <I><FONT color=brown>unselfishness</FONT></I>, that prompted his <I><FONT color=brown>generosity</FONT></I> to the charity appeal. While <I><FONT color=brown>unselfishness</FONT></I> is most often used to indicate a personal trait, the more formal <I><FONT color=brown>altruism</FONT></I> is usually reserved to indicate a moral or ethical principle. The word refers to the setting aside of all special or personal interests in determining which course of action will most benefit the group welfare. This makes the word a more specific and exact synonym for one possibility in <I><FONT color=brown>good will</FONT></I>: Australian Volunteers Abroad, searching for a way to put their youthful <I><FONT color=brown>altruism</FONT></I> into practice.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Generous">GENEROUS</A>, <A href="entry://Humane">HUMANE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Egoism">EGOISM</A>, malice, miserliness, stinginess.</P>

<P>These words pertain to the criticizing of one person by another. <B><FONT color=blue>Scold</FONT></B> is the most general and least formal of these. Often it can suggest an instance of reproof for misbehaviour that is meted out by a superior, such as a parent or teacher: She <I><FONT color=brown>scolded</FONT></I> the child for being late for school. In this situation, the word may specifically imply a distinction between a verbal reproach and reprimands that actually involve some form of punishment. Because of this, the word can sometimes suggest ineffectual attempts at discipline: She <I><FONT color=brown>scolded</FONT></I> her children frequently, but made no attempt to correct their unruly behaviour. <I><FONT color=brown>Scold</FONT></I> can even suggest continual nagging to no purpose, whether about serious faults or about trivialities; here, the relationship need not be between superior and inferior: a woman who constantly <I><FONT color=brown>scolded</FONT></I> her husband about the low pay he earned.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chide</FONT></B>, more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>scold</FONT></I>, is more exclusively focused on reproofs for specific failings. It can suggest a wider range of emotional contexts, ranging in reference from angry rebukes or taunts to charitable efforts to help someone surmount his shortcomings: gently <I><FONT color=brown>chiding</FONT></I> his students every time they misspelled a word; the fury with which he <I><FONT color=brown>chided</FONT></I> the legislators for their lack of compassion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Upbraid</FONT></B> stresses the lengthy expression of displeasure or criticism, often of a total performance rather than a single failing. This may take the form of a harangue, a tongue-lashing or, less severely, a pep-talk exhorting someone towards better behaviour. [He <I><FONT color=brown>upbraided</FONT></I> his wife about the sloppy way she kept the household accounts; The coach <I><FONT color=brown>upbraided</FONT></I> his team for the way they had bungled move after move in the first half of the game.] <B><FONT color=blue>Tell off</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tick off</FONT></B> are informal synonyms for <I><FONT color=brown>scold</FONT></I> which, according to context, can be earnest or half-humorous in intent; they are generally interchangeable: you should have heard the boss <I><FONT color=brown>tell</FONT></I> Charlie <I><FONT color=brown>off</FONT></I> this morning; next time I see that butcher I'll <I><FONT color=brown>tick</FONT></I> him <I><FONT color=brown>off</FONT></I> property.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Berate</FONT></B> can be used in a vague way for the administering of any sort of reproof, but more often it can suggest the total rejection of something or someone as being valueless, a judgement that can be delivered with no view to improving future performance. In this case, the word can also suggest an attitude of scorn or contempt for the thing being criticized, which is more often a whole pattern or way of life than a single instance of misbehaviour: a young man who <I><FONT color=brown>berated</FONT></I> his parents for their middle-class values. [A teacher who <I><FONT color=brown>berates</FONT></I> and belittles his students is only admitting his inability to teach them anything.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: disapprove, <A href="entry://Fault-finding">FAULT-FINDING<A>, <A href="entry://Malign">MALIGN</A>, <A href="entry://Rebuke">REBUKE</A>, <A href="entry://Shrew">SHREW</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a lack of fairness in judging or reporting because of the favouritism given to one way of viewing a subject. <B><FONT color=blue>Biased</FONT></B> suggests that someone judging or reporting a controversy is already disposed for or against one of the contending sides: He insisted that the jury was already <I><FONT color=brown>biased</FONT></I> by improper remarks made by the prosecution; an education that gave him a <I><FONT color=brown>biased</FONT></I> view of cultures different from his own; a <I><FONT color=brown>biased</FONT></I> account referring to the local councillors as self-seekers. <B><FONT color=blue>Prejudiced</FONT></B> in this context suggests a mind already disposed specifically against one view of something at issue; it also pertains more to judging something than to reporting it: The fairness of the trial was <I><FONT color=brown>prejudiced</FONT></I> by undue publicity; people who become <I><FONT color=brown>prejudiced</FONT></I>, however subtly, by the constant stereotyping of minority groups. <B><FONT color=blue>Subjective</FONT></B> refers to an inability to put personal interests aside in order to view a situation without preconceptions; it is a relative word in that the most conscientious attempt at objectivity cannot wholly overcome one’s innately <I><FONT color=brown>subjective</FONT></I> perspective: a <I><FONT color=brown>subjective</FONT></I> account of the war, overstressing the importance of those things the author happened to see first hand.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Slanted</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>one-sided</FONT></B> pertain mostly to reports rather than to judgements. <I><FONT color=brown>Slanted</FONT></I> suggests the deliberate suppression of some fact and expansion of others either to flatter the <I><FONT color=brown>biased</FONT></I> minds of readers or to convince them that the <I><FONT color=brown>biased</FONT></I> attitudes of the writer or publisher are correct: a news story that was <I><FONT color=brown>slanted</FONT></I> to make the incumbent candidate appear certain of re-election. <I><FONT color=brown>One-sided</FONT></I> suggests a far more extreme position than slanted in that only facts supporting a particular attitude are presented: a <I><FONT color=brown>one-sided</FONT></I> history of the conflict that made it appear to be a struggle between angels and monsters.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Partial</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>partisan</FONT></B> suggest different degrees of alignment with a cause. <I><FONT color=brown>Partial</FONT></I> may suggest either an unconscious or conscious favouring of a particular stand: countries that claimed to be neutral but were actually <I><FONT color=brown>partial</FONT></I> to the West; frankly admitting that he was <I><FONT color=brown>partial</FONT></I> to the union’s set of arguments. <I><FONT color=brown>Partisan</FONT></I> suggests wholehearted and unashamed commitment to and advocacy of a cause: to give equal time to <I><FONT color=brown>partisan</FONT></I> statements on the value of the proposed legislation. A <I><FONT color=brown>partisan</FONT></I> view of a matter is not necessarily unfair, provided the person is an advocate of that view and is not set up to judge between that view and another.

<P>These words refer to an unfair, irrational or unexamined attitude towards issues or people based on blanket preconceptions. <B><FONT color=blue>Bigotry</FONT></B> now refers almost exclusively to an intense dislike or even violent hatred for a particular group, race or religion. The comparable use of <B><FONT color=blue>prejudice</FONT></B> would indicate a similar but far less intense predisposition against such a group. <I><FONT color=brown>Bigotry</FONT></I> almost surely would be evidenced in unashamed public utterance or behaviour, whereas prejudice might remain largely unexpressed ?or even unknown to the person so afflicted: easier to cope with the outright <I><FONT color=brown>bigotry</FONT></I> of racialist groups than with the unexpressed prejudice of much of respectable society. <I><FONT color=brown>Prejudice</FONT></I>, also, can apply to any preconception: an abhorrence for the maltreatment of animals that would make him unable to hear the case without <I><FONT color=brown>prejudice</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intolerance</FONT></B> is used in its general sense of not being able to tolerate ?or put up with ?some idea or group of people at variance with one’s own thinking: we unfairly regard with <I><FONT color=brown>intolerance</FONT></I> the long hair, strange dress and weird music of our teenager. But it is also used in a similar sense to <I><FONT color=brown>bigotry</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>prejudice</FONT></I> in racial or religious matters, even if not so strong in its impact. <B><FONT color=blue>Bias</FONT></B> is unique among these words, since it can point to a predisposition either for or against something: He admitted that he had a sentimental <I><FONT color=brown>bias</FONT></I> for anything pertaining to Ireland; a strong <I><FONT color=brown>bias</FONT></I> in slum areas against policemen. Where <I><FONT color=brown>prejudice</FONT></I> can indicate a fixed, inflexible attitude, <I><FONT color=brown>bias</FONT></I> might suggest only a tendency to take a given view. Yet even such a mild predisposition could be disastrous where strict impartiality is required, as in a judge or juror: The lawyer argued that the judge’s <I><FONT color=brown>bias</FONT></I> had affected the conduct of the case.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Narrow-mindedness</FONT></B> points to a rigidity of preconceived attitudes, but specifically sees them as stemming from inexperience or a lack of exposure to a broader scale of values: the typical <I><FONT color=brown>narrow-mindedness</FONT></I> of people who stay in one rut without ever getting out of it to see how other people live. The word often suggests habitual insularity, backwardness, provinciality and lack of sophistication, but might be evidenced by an uneventful passivity or withdrawal rather than the hostile taking of stands suggested by the first pair: She was prevented from going to theatres or dances by the <I><FONT color=brown>narrow-mindedness</FONT></I> of her parents. But the word can apply to any dogmatic rigidity of view: Permissive parents are often guilty of as much <I><FONT color=brown>narrow-mindedness</FONT></I> as those who are belaboured for their authoritarian views on child-rearing. The word frequently points specifically to a prudish or puritan attitude towards sex or pleasure: He accused her of <I><FONT color=brown>narrow-mindedness</FONT></I> for refusing to have dinner with him in his flat. Obviously, the word is extremely relative and can be used by someone to refer to any behaviour, however, tolerant, that he may not find sufficiently acquiescent.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Biased">BIASED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: impartiality, objectivity, open-mindedness, tolerance.</P>

<P>These words refer to the uniting of both sexes in one individual, either in a biological or psychological sense. <B><FONT color=blue>Bisexual</FONT></B> is the most general of these, having the widest range of possible meaning. In a biological sense, it can refer to any living organism in which both male and female organs are present. For many forms of life, this is normal: <I><FONT color=brown>bisexual</FONT></I> flowers; <I><FONT color=brown>bisexual</FONT></I> angleworms. Thus, as a generic term, the word can group together all normally double-sexed plants and animals. In its reference to people, however, the word would never refer to those rare individuals who are abnormally born with both male and female organs. On the contrary, it refers to those people who, physiologically normal, are psychologically responsive to both sexes: that transitional phase when adolescents are <I><FONT color=brown>bisexual</FONT></I> in their sympathies and loyalties. Many psychologists view every individual as being normally <I><FONT color=brown>bisexual</FONT></I> in make-up, although only those men and women who have both homosexual and heterosexual relations can be called actively <I><FONT color=brown>bisexual</FONT></I>. The word is not likely to be used to describe someone whose appearance combines both male and female characteristics.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hermaphroditic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>androgynous</FONT></B> are more clear-cut in their reference to biological description. <I><FONT color=brown>Hermaphroditic</FONT></I> refers most specifically as a zoological term to animals in which the organs of both sexes appear normally in each individual, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>androgynous</FONT></I> applies as a botanical term to such double-sexed plants: viewing the volvox either as a colony of cells or as a <I><FONT color=brown>hermaphroditic</FONT></I> organism; effecting the hybridizing of corn by the sexual polarization of a normally <I><FONT color=brown>androgynous</FONT></I> species. Among such sexually polarized species as man, of course, a <I><FONT color=brown>hermaphroditic</FONT></I> individual may rarely occur as a biological abnormality, but the word would be strictly reserved for those cases in which both male and female sexual organs are anatomically present. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>hermaphroditic</FONT></I> is used less technically to refer to general appearance that partakes of both sexes. In this case, the word carries a tone of hyperbolic disapproval or amusement: The hair styles of young people grow more and more <I><FONT color=brown>hermaphroditic</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Androgynous</FONT></I> has a more formal ring even in its strict biological use, and can sound abstruse or curious when it applies more generally; here, it is not so likely to be confused with reference to biological structure: cultures in which sexual role-playing is relatively <I><FONT color=brown>androgynous</FONT></I> outside such biological functions as child-bearing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Epicene</FONT></B> has no relevance to biological classification whatever, referring strictly to someone who in appearance or attitudes unites qualities of both sexes: a large, puffy face with soft features that were strikingly <I><FONT color=brown>epicene</FONT></I> in appearance. The word usually carries a disapproving or at least negative tone. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>bisexual</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>epicene</FONT></I> may not refer to activity at all and may in fact suggest someone who appears sexless or is marked by no strong characteristics of either sex. In a culture that places a high value on manliness, <I><FONT color=brown>epicene</FONT></I> can often refer to effeminacy in men or even to neurasthenic male qualities: cultural stereotypes of the virile warrior and the <I><FONT color=brown>epicene</FONT></I> intellectual.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Feminine">FEMININE</A>, <A href="entry://Masculine">MASCULINE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a caustic, sharp or rancorous temper or manner. <B><FONT color=blue>Bitterness</FONT></B> can indicate, most generally, a gloomy, dour or cold disposition, but its special connotations suggest a deep-seated rage directed inwards more than an anger directed at others, with disillusion or a conviction of injustice as its possible source and a smouldering cynicism as its possible result: lifelong <I><FONT color=brown>bitterness</FONT></I> at losing the woman he loved. <B><FONT color=blue>Sourness</FONT></B> is less intense than <I><FONT color=brown>bitterness</FONT></I> but suggests somewhat the same dour manner with an inward-directed disillusion as its source: What was <I><FONT color=brown>sourness</FONT></I> in Hamlet’s view of the world has deepened to <I><FONT color=brown>bitterness</FONT></I> in Timon’s. On the other hand, <I><FONT color=brown>sourness</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>bitterness</FONT></I>, might suggest an external appearance only: a cheerful disposition that belied the <I><FONT color=brown>sourness</FONT></I> of her wrinkled face. <B><FONT color=blue>Harshness</FONT></B> relates more to manner than to disposition, suggesting not so much rancour as cruelty, either deliberate or unintentional: a teacher who met every infraction of the rules with <I><FONT color=brown>harshness</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Harshness</FONT></I>, however, might merely be employed as a tactic: trying to soften his will first with wheedling, then with <I><FONT color=brown>harshness</FONT></I>.</P><P>The remaining words have a greater degree of formality than the foregoing. <B><FONT color=blue>Acerbity</FONT></B> relates most closely to sourness, suggesting an acidity of attitude that might, however, be expressed by a more directly sharp manner than with <I><FONT color=brown>sourness</FONT></I>: the abrupt <I><FONT color=brown>acerbity</FONT></I> with which he countered our every attempt at a casual conversation. <B><FONT color=blue>Asperity</FONT></B> relates most closely to <I><FONT color=brown>harshness</FONT></I>, with special emphasis on roughness or severity of treatment; implying even an arbitrary unevenness of disposition: the bewildering <I><FONT color=brown>asperity</FONT></I> of a governess who first ignored his questions and then punished him for asking them. <B><FONT color=blue>Acrimony</FONT></B> relates most closely to <I><FONT color=brown>bitterness</FONT></I>, but with a more outwardly directed rancour implied, even to the point of biting, irritating and enraged actions: trying to make peace in a charged atmosphere clouded by <I><FONT color=brown>acrimony</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Sour">SOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Vindictive">VINDICTIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: blandness, mildness, sweetness.</P>

<P>These words refer to anything that is thought extremely strange, eccentric, unusual, abnormal, ugly or deformed. <B><FONT color=blue>Bizarre</FONT></B> points to the strange and unusual when they cause shock or surprise because of the unexpected, incongruous or sensational forms they assume: skyscrapers that were as <I><FONT color=brown>bizarre</FONT></I> to him as his village of mud huts would have been to us; the flamboyant gothic style in which the stonework of the arches and windows took on <I><FONT color=brown>bizarre</FONT></I> convoluted designs. <B><FONT color=blue>Grotesque</FONT></B> suggests more readily the eccentric or deformed when seen as a comic or horrible caricature of some norm: Falstaff and the other <I><FONT color=brown>grotesque</FONT></I> cronies of the young prince; children with <I><FONT color=brown>grotesque</FONT></I>, cadaverous bodies, blighted by disease and malnutrition.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fantastic</FONT></B> is more general and less concrete than the previous words. It can be used of anything that is fanciful or dreamlike or that appears as a departure from common-sense reality: the <I><FONT color=brown>fantastic</FONT></I> nightmare world of Hieronymous Bosch; a <I><FONT color=brown>fantastic</FONT></I> tower made of concrete, bottles, hubcaps and cans. The word is over-used as a hyperbole for anything pleasant, good or out of the ordinary. <B><FONT color=blue>Weird</FONT></B> is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>fantastic</FONT></I> in suggesting a harp break from ordinary reality: a <I><FONT color=brown>weird</FONT></I> feeling that time was standing still as the car hurtled down the cliff; <I><FONT color=brown>weird</FONT></I> forms of ocean life that live where sunlight never reaches them. This word, too, is over-used as a hyperbole for anything mildly unusual. <B><FONT color=blue>Outlandish</FONT></B> once suggested behaviour typical of people on the periphery of a cultural centre; now it more commonly suggests anything that is unusual to the point of shock or outrage: the <I><FONT color=brown>outlandish</FONT></I> dress of the pop singer; disgusted by their <I><FONT color=brown>outlandish</FONT></I> manners.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Way-out</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>far-out</FONT></B> are current fad words for anything that represents a sharp departure from the norm. Most often, they are used as approving hyperboles for anything out of the ordinary: a marvellous, way-out party. These words are often used in descriptions of avant-garde art or the rebellious nonconformity of young people.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Queer">QUEER</A>, <A href="entry://Unusual">UNUSUAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>, unexceptional.</P>

<P>These words refer to taste, odours and other sensations that are unassertive in character. <B><FONT color=blue>Bland</FONT></B> is the most specific of these, referring most appropriately to food that has not been heavily spiced: The doctor recommended a <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I>, salt-free diet for the patient. In other uses, the word may refer similarly to something of even disposition, without extremes, or lacking in tension: the <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I> domestic atmosphere in the house, free of argument or petty bickering; a <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I>, hazy spring day, neither too warm nor too cool. While these uses give a positive connotation, the word can become negative in tone when it suggests a lack of desirable excitement, flavour or interest: the <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I>, anonymous cooking of the English; a <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I> novel that I began but couldn’t finish; the <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I> attitude of many lowland farmers despite the flood warning.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Moderate</FONT></B> is more neutral in tone than bland, being simply descriptive of a middle ground between extremes, without necessarily suggesting a positive or negative evaluation: a <I><FONT color=brown>moderate</FONT></I> winter and summer; a <I><FONT color=brown>moderate</FONT></I> conservative. Juxtaposed with a bad extreme, however, the word can give an approving tone: a reign that was thought <I><FONT color=brown>moderate</FONT></I> and tolerant after the blood-baths of the previous ruler. Both <B><FONT color=blue>gentle</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mild</FONT></B> suggest an avoidance of extremes, but with a more forthrightly approving tone than <I><FONT color=brown>moderate</FONT></I> has. <I><FONT color=brown>Gentle</FONT></I> suggests a slight use of force to gain a result or a tender consideration for someone else: a <I><FONT color=brown>gentle</FONT></I> breeze of the patio; a <I><FONT color=brown>gentle</FONT></I> way of reprimanding her son. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>gentle</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>mild</FONT></I> does not point to restrained power or considerate behaviour so much as it indicates something thoroughly without harshness by its very nature: <I><FONT color=brown>mild</FONT></I> autumn weather; <I><FONT color=brown>mild</FONT></I> suburban faces. Like <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I>, however, <I><FONT color=brown>mild</FONT></I> can suggest something so toned-down as to be uninteresting or unexciting: a comedy that offers only <I><FONT color=brown>mild</FONT></I> amusement; disclosures that were <I><FONT color=brown>mild</FONT></I> compared to those still forthcoming. The negative tone here is still far less intense or thoroughgoing than is true for <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Soothing</FONT></B> is the most positive in tone of all these words. Something might be <I><FONT color=brown>gentle</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>mild</FONT></I> and still not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>soothing</FONT></I> suggests sensations that are positively comforting, helpful or healing, either by the removal of irritation or by the application of something to overcome it: listening to the <I><FONT color=brown>soothing</FONT></I> silence; <I><FONT color=brown>soothing</FONT></I> ointment to relieve her sunburn. <B><FONT color=blue>Dull</FONT></B> compares strikingly with <I><FONT color=brown>soothing</FONT></I> in suggesting the complete absence of anything pleasurable. As such, is almost exclusively stresses, and with greater force, possibilities inherent in <I><FONT color=brown>bland</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>mild</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I> evening playing cards with the neighbours; <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I> meals completely lacking in zest. <I><FONT color=brown>Dull</FONT></I> may of course apply more descriptively, like <I><FONT color=brown>moderate</FONT></I>, to low-key sensations: a <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I> grey sky; an artist who tended to use a palette of <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I>, subtly shaded colours.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Monotonous">MONOTONOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Tranquil">TRANQUIL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: exciting, harsh, <A href="entry://Keen">KEEN</A>, <A href="entry://Sour">SOUR</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to sounds of high intensity or volume, or to statements or ways of behaving that are excessive or strident. <B><FONT color=blue>Loud</FONT></B> is the most general of these, referring most concretely to sounds that are of high volume and carry considerable distances: <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I> angry voices resounding down the hallway; foghorns <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I> enough to be heard nearly a mile inland. The word may also refer to offensive behaviour or appearance: a <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I> sports shirt; people with garish tastes and <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I> manners. <B><FONT color=blue>Noisy</FONT></B> and <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I>, the most informal of these words, differ in that loud refers to specific sources of high-volume <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I> whereas noisy refers to a general density of sound emanating from many sources: a <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I> burglar alarm ringing in the deserted street; a maddeningly <I><FONT color=brown>noisy</FONT></I> neighbourhood. <I><FONT color=brown>Noisy</FONT></I>, however, need not refer to sounds of high volume: the <I><FONT color=brown>noisy</FONT></I> chirring of crickets, low but incessant. While the word has fewer applications to behaviour, it suggests relentlessness or impatience: using a <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I> speaking voice to reach his <I><FONT color=brown>noisy</FONT></I> audience; hating <I><FONT color=brown>noisy</FONT></I> arguments in which everybody shouted and interrupted one another.</P><P>The remaining words all relate to specific but separate aspects of loud or noisy. <B><FONT color=blue>Blatant</FONT></B> refers most concretely to a raised insistent voice, but it gives a disapproving tone: the <I><FONT color=brown>blatant</FONT></I> hucksters of the hard-sell television commercial. More and more often, however, the word is used for any distasteful appeal or obvious and vulgar disregard for the sensibilities: <I><FONT color=brown>blatant</FONT></I> lies; <I><FONT color=brown>blatant</FONT></I> bad manners that matched his dishevelled appearance. <B><FONT color=blue>Obstreperous</FONT></B> is in every way an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>blatant</FONT></I>: the unruly screaming and shouting of her <I><FONT color=brown>obstreperous</FONT></I> children. It is now more often used to refer to extremely distasteful manners, with a stress on deliberate rudeness, or to unruly behaviour that is completely out of control: <I><FONT color=brown>obstreperous</FONT></I> insults; <I><FONT color=brown>obstreperous</FONT></I> guests who ruined the party.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Boisterous</FONT></B> emphasizes, without the disapproval inherent in the previous pair of words, good high spirits that result in <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>noisy</FONT></I> behaviour: <I><FONT color=brown>boisterous</FONT></I> group-singing in the ski lodge at night. <B><FONT color=blue>Clamorous</FONT></B> specifically pertains to insistent or repeated entreaties, suggesting outcries at danger or a panicked disorder: the <I><FONT color=brown>clamorous</FONT></I> cries of miners in the blocked tunnel. In this sense, the word may sound somewhat outdated, but it is still used for any general din of <I><FONT color=brown>noisy</FONT></I> voices or general outcry: a quarter of the city resounding with the <I><FONT color=brown>clamorous</FONT></I> appeals of hawkers and vendors; theatre foyers filled with a <I><FONT color=brown>clamorous</FONT></I> hubbub during intermission. <B><FONT color=blue>Vociferous</FONT></B> refers to an insistent, urgent or strident manner of speaking, sometimes suggesting anger or the determination to drive home a point; <I><FONT color=brown>vociferous</FONT></I> arguments between Freudians and Jungians; a <I><FONT color=brown>vociferous</FONT></I> outcry against the referee’s decision.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Noise">NOISE</A>, <A href="entry://Unruly">UNRULY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: disciplined, peaceful, retiring, <A href="entry://Silent">SILENT</A>, soft, subdued, <A href="entry://Taciturn">TACITURN</A>, <A href="entry://Tranquil">TRANQUIL</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>fire</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>blaze</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>conflagration</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>flame</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the burning of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Fire</FONT></B> is the most general of these, referring both to slow or rapid burning, whether of small or great size: a wisp of tissue paper that caught <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I>, burned for an instant, then went out; a bush <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I> that covered several miles at the peak of its intensity. <B><FONT color=blue>Flame</FONT></B> may refer to one isolated small <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I>: reading his watch by the <I><FONT color=brown>flame</FONT></I> of a match. Or it may refer to each momentary fork or tongue of a larger <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I>: watching the largest log on the fire finally burst into <I><FONT color=brown>flame</FONT></I>. In this case, the word is often used in the plural to express the multitude of such elements making up a <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I>, or to indicate their diversity of placement: staring for hours into the flickering <I><FONT color=brown>flames</FONT></I>; The fireman pointed to new <I><FONT color=brown>flames</FONT></I> licking though the roof and the second-story windows of the building.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>blaze</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>conflagration</FONT></B> stress intensity and rapidness of burning, with <I><FONT color=brown>blaze</FONT></I> functioning as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>conflagration</FONT></I> as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>blaze</FONT></I>. In addition, <I><FONT color=brown>blaze</FONT></I> can give connotations of a controlled, cheerful warmth, while <I><FONT color=brown>conflagration</FONT></I> is more closely restricted to a widespread destructive or accidental burning: a comforting <I><FONT color=brown>blaze</FONT></I> roaring in the fireplace; a <I><FONT color=brown>conflagration</FONT></I> that almost destroyed the City of London in 1666. <I><FONT color=brown>Blaze</FONT></I> can, of course, be used in ways that approach the suggestions of <I><FONT color=brown>conflagration</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>blaze</FONT></I> that took the lives of six boarders and one fireman.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Catastrophe">CATASTROPHE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to people or things that look wasted or inhospitable. <B><FONT color=blue>Bleak</FONT></B> is the most general of these and can apply equally well to people or things, especially landscapes or houses. It suggests a bare or unpleasant prospect: the <I><FONT color=brown>bleak</FONT></I>, ice-encrusted mountains of the Andes; the <I><FONT color=brown>bleak</FONT></I>, unpainted house that seemed almost uninhabitable. Used of people, it suggests a facial expression that is unhappy or unfriendly: She gave her husband a <I><FONT color=brown>bleak</FONT></I>, unsatisfied look. It can, of course, suggest anything unhopeful or unpromising: their one <I><FONT color=brown>bleak</FONT></I> hope for survival.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gaunt</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>haggard</FONT></B> are more closely tied to the physical appearance of people. <I><FONT color=brown>Gaunt</FONT></I> stresses leanness but it may or may not suggest a wasted or shrunken appearance: the sailor’s <I><FONT color=brown>gaunt</FONT></I>, weather-beaten face. <I><FONT color=brown>Haggard</FONT></I>, however, insists on emaciation or at very least suggests a drawn expression resulting from strain or shock: the <I><FONT color=brown>haggard</FONT></I> faces of the prisoners in the concentration camp; a face <I><FONT color=brown>haggard</FONT></I> with grief. <I><FONT color=brown>Gaunt</FONT></I> can also apply to things or landscapes, in which case it suggests a harsh or bare scene: the <I><FONT color=brown>gaunt</FONT></I> moors of the Brontë country. In this context, <I><FONT color=brown>bleak</FONT></I> is more intense than <I><FONT color=brown>gaunt</FONT></I>: grateful for even the <I><FONT color=brown>gaunt</FONT></I> plains after the <I><FONT color=brown>bleak</FONT></I> wasteland of the desert. <I><FONT color=brown>Haggard</FONT></I> would sound less natural in describing anything other than people, but used metaphorically, it might suggest a worn, run-down appearance: the rows of <I><FONT color=brown>haggard</FONT></I> houses that testified to poverty and neglect.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Desolate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>barren</FONT></B> refer to uninhabitable or unfeatured landscape. <I><FONT color=brown>Desolate</FONT></I> suggests an underpopulated starkness, <I><FONT color=brown>barren</FONT></I> a complete absence of life: only a few farmhouses strung out over the <I><FONT color=brown>desolate</FONT></I> countryside; <I><FONT color=brown>barren</FONT></I> rocks where the smallest shrub could find no foothold. <I><FONT color=brown>Desolate</FONT></I> can, however, also suggest solitariness or friendlessness: a <I><FONT color=brown>desolate</FONT></I> pine or two struggling for life above the timber line: a girl left <I><FONT color=brown>desolate</FONT></I> in the strange city. <I><FONT color=brown>Barren</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>bleak</FONT></I>, can suggest an unpromising outlook; a plan <I><FONT color=brown>barren</FONT></I> of practical remedies. <I><FONT color=brown>Barren</FONT></I>, in the sense discussed here, could not be applied to people.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dismal">DISMAL</A>, GLOOMY</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheerful">CHEERFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Comfortable">COMFORTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Healthy">HEALTHY</A>, luxurious.</P>

All can suggest silly or ridiculous behaviour that arises from any number of causes: letting the woman make a <I><FONT color=brown>fool</FONT></I> of him; don’t be an <I><FONT color=brown>idiot</FONT></I> ?accept the offer of a new job. <I><FONT color=brown>Chump</FONT></I>, besides being a much more informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>fool</FONT></I>, can indicate somebody who allows himself to be come the butt of a joke or confidence game: looking for <I><FONT color=brown>chumps</FONT></I> who could be lured into buying worthless share certificates. <I><FONT color=brown>Chump</FONT></I> can also be a severely contemptuous term for any sort of unsophiscated or ordinary person: <I><FONT color=brown>chumps</FONT></I> dumb enough to be taken in by sensational journalism. Like a <I><FONT color=brown>chump</FONT></I> or a <I><FONT color=brown>fool</FONT></I>, a <B><FONT color=blue>dill</FONT></B> is easily taken in or can usually be relied on to do the stupid or naive thing: a bit of a <I><FONT color=brown>dill</FONT></I>, the way he always lets others take advantage of him.</P><P>The remaining group of words relates to the last suggestion of <I><FONT color=brown>chump</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>dill</FONT></I> in indicating contempt for ordinary or simple people. When it is not an informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>fool</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>boob</FONT></B> suggests a heavy, stupid person. <B><FONT color=blue>Nincompoop</FONT></B> has particular relevance in describing a foolish man, suggesting a weakling afflicted by timidity and passivity: situation comedies that stereotype husbands as bumbling <I><FONT color=brown>nincompoops</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Ninny</FONT></B> can apply to either sex, but may be particularly useful in reference to foolish women, suggesting silly, precious or prissy behaviour: a <I><FONT color=brown>ninny</FONT></I> who wrote saccharine poems about butterflies and daffodils.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Moron">MORON</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: sage, savant, wise man.</P>

bloody
<B><FONT color=blue>bloody</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bloodthirsty</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gory</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sanguinary</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the spilling of blood or to an attitude that delights in bloodshed. <B><FONT color=blue>Bloody</FONT></B> suggests freshly spilt blood or conflict that results in heavy casualties: the <I><FONT color=brown>bloody</FONT></I> hands of the suspect; the <I><FONT color=brown>bloody</FONT></I>, four-day battle. It is also frequently used as an epithet for someone or something responsible for wanton slaughter: the <I><FONT color=brown>bloody</FONT></I> Stalinist purges; Hitler’s bloody henchmen; <I><FONT color=brown>Bloody</FONT></I> Mary. <I><FONT color=brown>Bloody</FONT></I> has come to be used as a curse word for anything displeasing. This use was once taken as a blasphemous reference to Christ’s blood, but over-use has weakened its force: He cursed the <I><FONT color=brown>bloody</FONT></I> tricycle he had tripped over in the dark. <B><FONT color=blue>Gory</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests clotted or dried blood: police photographing the <I><FONT color=brown>gory</FONT></I> knife. It may also refer to any production that revels in giving extremely detailed accounts of gruesome accidents or murders: a <I><FONT color=brown>gory</FONT></I> detective story. This use also appears in the cliché, the <I><FONT color=brown>gory</FONT></I> details, which suggests the loving and minute description of anything unpleasant.</P><P>The remaining words apply primarily to an eagerness to let blood, either literally or figuratively. <B><FONT color=blue>Bloodthirsty</FONT></B> is most specific here, suggesting a delight in inflicting harm on others, especially in armed combat: <I><FONT color=brown>bloodthirsty</FONT></I> generals who urged the king to declare war; <I><FONT color=brown>bloodthirsty</FONT></I> guerillas intent on terrorizing the native villagers. The word can also be used figuratively to describe people who enjoy reading or seeing accounts of bloody happenings: <I><FONT color=brown>bloodthirsty</FONT></I> audiences who dote on gory television dramas.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sanguinary</FONT></B> is considerably more formal than these other words, giving a literary, almost euphemistic substitute for bloody or <I><FONT color=brown>bloodthirsty</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>sanguinary</FONT></I> oppression of the conquered nation.

<P>These nouns denote various ways of hitting with the hand. <B><FONT color=blue>Blow</FONT></B> is the inclusive term. In a generic sense, it may be applied to any forceful impact of a hand, implement, or weapon against another object: a <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> with the flat of the hand; a hammer <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> with a blunt object. In specific comparison with the other words, a <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> is a forceful hit with the fist: The fighter felled his opponent with a mighty <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Punch</FONT></B> is a more informal word than <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I>; and, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I>, it is limited in application. A <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I> is a quick, short <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> or jab with the fist, typically aimed at a particular target: a <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I> in the eye. <I><FONT color=brown>Punch</FONT></I> is a boxing term: to throw a <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I>; to land a <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I>; to roll with a <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I>. A boxer dazed by repeated <I><FONT color=brown>blows</FONT></I> to the head is referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>punch-drunk</FONT></I>. Outside the ring, <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I> often suggests a belligerent attitude, the desire to pick a fight: I’m going to give you a <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I> in the nose.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>slap</FONT></B> is a sharp <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> delivered with the open hand or with something flat. A <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I> in the face stings or smarts and is often intended to be a rebuke; Her date started to get fresh and she gave him a <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I>. In earlier days, a <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I> on the cheek with a glove was a calculated insult whereby one man challenged another to a duel. But a <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I> in the face may be given to shock someone out of hysteria. And a <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I> on the back is a hearty, friendly, man-to-man form of greeting or congratulations.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cuff</FONT></B> once could mean a <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> with the fist, a usage that survives in the word fisticuffs; but now a <I><FONT color=brown>cuff</FONT></I> is usually a sidelong <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> with the open hand or a cushioned <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I> with a paw: The mother cat gave her kitten a <I><FONT color=brown>cuff</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>box</FONT></B> may be struck with the palm or fist, but where cuff stresses the type of <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>box</FONT></I> emphasizes the part of the body that is hit ?the ear, cheek or side of the head. Both <I><FONT color=brown>box</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>cuff</FONT></I> are specifically applied to a <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I> on the ear, a punishment that was part of the schoolhouse discipline of an earlier era: to give an unruly boy a <I><FONT color=brown>cuff</FONT></I> (or a <I><FONT color=brown>box</FONT></I>) on the ear.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>rap</FONT></B> is a sharp, quick <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> and a <B><FONT color=blue>knock</FONT></B> is a harder, heavier one. Both may be made with the knuckles, and both make sounds that signal a person’s presence: an insistent <I><FONT color=brown>knock</FONT></I> at the door; a light <I><FONT color=brown>rap</FONT></I> on the window pane. But a <I><FONT color=brown>rap</FONT></I> may also be administered with an implement as a mild form of punishment, and in this case the knuckles may receive the <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> rather than striking it: The teacher gave him a <I><FONT color=brown>rap</FONT></I> on the knuckles with her ruler. Figuratively, to take the <I><FONT color=brown>rap</FONT></I> is to accept punishment for some failure or misdeed. <I><FONT color=brown>Knock</FONT></I> as a noun suggests the physical punishment of a fight only in a figurative sense: the school of hard <I><FONT color=brown>knocks</FONT></I>. In a similar way, to take the <I><FONT color=brown>knock</FONT></I> is to be hard hit or responsible financially. <I><FONT color=brown>Blow</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I>, and <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I> are also used figuratively. A <I><FONT color=brown>slap</FONT></I> in the face is an insult, rebuke or slur. An editorial with <I><FONT color=brown>punch</FONT></I> has vitality and force. A <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> is a calamity that hits the emotions with a sudden, forceful impact: His tragic death was a <I><FONT color=brown>blow</FONT></I> from which she never fully recovered.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Beat">BEAT</A>, <A href="entry://Fight">FIGHT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: caress, touch.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>blush</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>colour</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>flush</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>redden</FONT></B>:

<P>All these words have uses to describe the change in a person’s facial appearance when he is embarrassed or under a strain. <B><FONT color=blue>Blush</FONT></B> is specifically restricted to the rushing of blood into the face of someone who is shocked or embarrassed: She <I><FONT color=brown>blushed</FONT></I> easily at any talk of bodily functions. It is more commonly used to describe a woman; a man who <I><FONT color=brown>blushes</FONT></I> might be thought effeminate. <B><FONT color=blue>Colour</FONT></B> is a less precise, almost euphemistic synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>blush</FONT></I>: the girl who <I><FONT color=brown>coloured</FONT></I> under his glance. When applied to a man, it might suggest an attempt to avoid the effeminacy implied in <I><FONT color=brown>blush</FONT></I>. In any case, because <I><FONT color=brown>colour</FONT></I> has so many other uses and can sound confusing in this context, it might best be avoided altogether.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Flush</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>colour</FONT></I>, might be used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>blush</FONT></I> to avoid any note of effeminacy: his face <I><FONT color=brown>flushing</FONT></I> at the mere mention of her name. It is more commonly used, however, to refer to a feverish condition, either from illness, exertion or exposure: their faces <I><FONT color=brown>flushed</FONT></I> from hours of drill and callisthenics. <I><FONT color=brown>Flush</FONT></I> can also indicate emotional seizures other than embarrassment: a face <I><FONT color=brown>flushed</FONT></I> with anger; a crowd <I><FONT color=brown>flushed</FONT></I> with excitement.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Redden</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>colour</FONT></I>, can substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>blush</FONT></I>, but in being specific about the physical change involved, it sounds less euphemistic than <I><FONT color=brown>colour</FONT></I>. It also, like <I><FONT color=brown>flush</FONT></I>, can result from other emotional seizures: a scowl <I><FONT color=brown>reddened</FONT></I> by rage. Both <I><FONT color=brown>redden</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>colour</FONT></I> can, of course, describe skin changes outside the present context: a face <I><FONT color=brown>reddened</FONT></I> by long exposure to sun and wind; the skin slowly <I><FONT color=brown>colouring</FONT></I> from the sharp blow.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Colour">COLOUR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: blanch, <A href="entry://Pale">PALE</A>, whiten.</P>

<P>These words refer to feelings of self-congratulation. <B><FONT color=blue>Boast</FONT></B> may suggest justifiable self-satisfaction: a college that <I><FONT color=brown>boasts</FONT></I> an unusually high number of distinguished Old Boys. More often, however, the word suggests a self-important and tasteless pointing out of one’s own successes: He monopolized the conversation by <I><FONT color=brown>boasting</FONT></I> of his own prowess at hunting and fishing; continually boasting and blowing his own horn. Occasionally the word can refer to self-congratulation for a victory not yet won: He <I><FONT color=brown>boasted</FONT></I> that he would finish off the challenger in the first round. <B><FONT color=blue>Pride</FONT></B> is close to the justified self-satisfaction possible for boast, but it more often specifically suggests private self-regard rather than a public expression of it; it is usually reflexive: He secretly <I><FONT color=brown>prided</FONT></I> himself on a life of absolute honesty. The word can suggest a stiff-necked self-righteousness or a faulty estimate of one’s own virtues: <I><FONT color=brown>Priding</FONT></I> himself on his democratic outlook, he nevertheless sent his children to a private school.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brag</FONT></B> intensifies the note of tastelessness in <I><FONT color=brown>boast</FONT></I>, suggesting limitless conceit and, possibly, inaccuracy of the claims being made: <I><FONT color=brown>bragging</FONT></I> about his imaginary exploits in the last war; <I><FONT color=brown>bragging</FONT></I> about his son’s success at school as a way of patting himself on the back. <B><FONT color=blue>Crow</FONT></B> suggests noisy or vociferous <I><FONT color=brown>bragging</FONT></I> of an extremely offensive kind after the event: publicly <I><FONT color=brown>crowing</FONT></I> about the defeat of his opponent. <B><FONT color=blue>Gloat</FONT></B> is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>crow</FONT></I>. Although it need not be verbal and sometimes suggests taunting someone that one has bested: rubbing his hands in secret and <I><FONT color=brown>gloating</FONT></I> over the way he had made the other applicants look foolish; <I><FONT color=brown>gloating</FONT></I> openly and lording it over those who had failed the examination.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Strut</FONT></B> suggests less animus than <I><FONT color=brown>gloat</FONT></I> but it is similar in not necessarily being verbal. It invariably suggests, however, an act done as a matter of public display: so puffed up and smug over his recent successes that he could not refrain from <I><FONT color=brown>strutting</FONT></I> about and preening himself before his fewer and fewer friends. <B><FONT color=blue>Vaunt</FONT></B> is considerably more formal than the other words here; it compares to the understandable self-satisfaction suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>boast</FONT></I>, but it is a shade more self-righteous, possibly suggesting a claim that cannot be substantiated. It differs from <I><FONT color=brown>pride</FONT></I> in usually implying a public expression of self-esteem: <I><FONT color=brown>vaunting</FONT></I> far and wide the cultural opportunities lying in wait for visitors to their small town.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conceited">CONCEITED</A>, <A href="entry://Confidence">CONFIDENCE</A>, <A href="entry://Egoism">EGOISM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Belittle">BELITTLE</A>, minimize, underrate.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>bombastic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>orotund</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>purple</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>turgid</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are used to describe styles of speaking or writing. <B><FONT color=blue>Bombastic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>turgid</FONT></B> are alike in designating a lack of restraint and discipline that so inflates the language used in a piece of writing or in a speech that its style and content are thrown out of balance. <I><FONT color=brown>Bombastic</FONT></I> is derived from the noun bombast which originally denoted the kind of cotton, wool or other soft material which is used for padding and stuffing. The suggestion of padding is very much present in any reference to a <I><FONT color=brown>bombastic</FONT></I> style which, though it does not always connote the complete absence of thought, certainly indicates an imbalance between the thought and the manner used to express it: For so trivial a topic, his speech was <I><FONT color=brown>bombastic</FONT></I> and cheaply theatrical. <I><FONT color=brown>Turgid</FONT></I> literally means swollen or distended, as by contained air or liquid: a healthy, <I><FONT color=brown>turgid</FONT></I> muscle; a leg <I><FONT color=brown>turgid</FONT></I> with infection. Like <I><FONT color=brown>bombastic</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>turgid</FONT></I> carries over a suggestion of its literal meaning into its figurative reference to style: a tiny idea which the author has blown up into this <I><FONT color=brown>turgid</FONT></I>, trying novel. <B><FONT color=blue>Orotund</FONT></B> is used positively to describe a full, clear, round and resonant tone of voice. The figurative sense of the word, however, is pejorative in its synonymity with <I><FONT color=brown>bombastic</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Orotund</FONT></I> can apply to pompous, inflated speech or writing, but, because of its particular reference to sound, it is most often used to describe the spoken word: a speech so <I><FONT color=brown>orotund</FONT></I> as to cause yawns and whispers all over the auditorium. <B><FONT color=blue>Purple</FONT></B>, in the sense being compared here, means ornate or flowery. It is pejorative in its suggestion of too much colour and showiness: a good playwright who ruined some of his most dramatic moments with passages of bad poetry and <I><FONT color=brown>purple</FONT></I> prose. It also has come to refer to the erotic, the lurid, the vulgar or the profane: a TV compere whose interviews led to such <I><FONT color=brown>purple</FONT></I> exchanges that a sponsor demanded his dismissal.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Formal">FORMAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: brief, precise, quite, simple, <A href="entry://Terse">TERSE</A>.</P>

<P>These adjectives refer to extreme thinness in which the underlying bones are evident. <B><FONT color=blue>Bony</FONT></B> is the most general word and is relatively free of connotations. It simply indicates a prominent bone structure, whether this is deemed a sign of attractiveness, asceticism, chronic undernourishment or near-starvation: a crooner’s <I><FONT color=brown>bony</FONT></I>, boyish face; a waif-like actress with <I><FONT color=brown>bony</FONT></I> shoulders and big eyes; a bony Indian fakir; a <I><FONT color=brown>bony</FONT></I>, sway-backed nag. <I><FONT color=brown>Bony</FONT></I> is frequently applied to a single part of the body: long, <I><FONT color=brown>bony</FONT></I> fingers; <I><FONT color=brown>bony</FONT></I> knees. And it may sometimes emphasize attributes of bone that are not seen but felt, such as hardness or sharpness: She jabbed me with a <I><FONT color=brown>bony</FONT></I> elbow.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gaunt</FONT></B> implies a paucity of flesh and prominence of bone. It comes from the Old Norse word for a tall, thin person and it indicates an angular leanness: the tall, <I><FONT color=brown>gaunt</FONT></I> figure of Don Quixote. Specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>gaunt</FONT></I> often calls to mind the haggard look of the hungry, anguished, ill or old. It suggests the weariness of long suffering or constant strain, describing one who seems to have been worn down to the bone: the <I><FONT color=brown>gaunt</FONT></I>, ascetic figure of a saint; a <I><FONT color=brown>gaunt</FONT></I> old man, hollow-eyed, with prominent cheekbones and attenuated limbs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Wasted</FONT></B> implies a loss of flesh, stressing the cause of bony thinness. A <I><FONT color=brown>wasted</FONT></I> body is one that has been gradually consumed ?reduced to skin and bone by the ravages of time, grief, hunger or disease: <I><FONT color=brown>wasted</FONT></I> away by tuberculosis; a pallid face and <I><FONT color=brown>wasted</FONT></I> frame. Hence <I><FONT color=brown>wasted</FONT></I> implies physical weakness and frailty; the <I><FONT color=brown>wasted</FONT></I> form of a 100-year-old woman; a body <I><FONT color=brown>wasted</FONT></I> by disease.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Emaciated</FONT></B> focuses on both the cause and the fact of abnormal leanness. It indicates a previous <I><FONT color=brown>wasting</FONT></I> away, implying the depletion of the body by grave illness, great suffering or terrible deprivation. <B><FONT color=blue>Skeletal</FONT></B> is the most extreme of all these words, pointing to the deathlike dominance of bone. Both <I><FONT color=brown>skeletal</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>emaciated</FONT></I> may suggest the leanness of living men who look like skeletons, their ribs and sharp bones showing through the skin: <I><FONT color=brown>emaciated</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>skeletal</FONT></I>) survivors of a Nazi concentration camp. But <I><FONT color=brown>skeletal</FONT></I> has about it the further suggestion of something lifeless of unreal, not fully human or alive: a painting of <I><FONT color=brown>skeletal</FONT></I> men and women in a barren future world; a novelist whose characters seem to be <I><FONT color=brown>skeletal</FONT></I> symbols, thoroughly analysed but not fleshed out and never really brought to life. <I><FONT color=brown>Emaciated</FONT></I>, by contrast, is often expressive of human pity or horror at a skeletal appearance: the awful sight of <I><FONT color=brown>emaciated</FONT></I> children with distended bellies and glazed expressions.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lanky">LANKY</A>, <A href="entry://Pale">PALE</A>, <A href="entry://Thin">THIN</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Fat">FAT</A>, nourished, well-fed.</P>

<P>These words refer to money, land or goods seized by war, violence or fraud. <B><FONT color=blue>Loot</FONT></B> in its oldest sense referred to goods seized specifically in war, especially goods of great value. More recently, it would better suggest money or goods acquired by theft: jewel thieves dividing their <I><FONT color=brown>loot</FONT></I>.

In slang use, <I><FONT color=brown>loot</FONT></I> can refer simply to money, regardless of how acquired: how much <I><FONT color=brown>loot</FONT></I> have you got on you: By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>swag</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>haul</FONT></B> are slang words for goods acquired by theft, although <I><FONT color=brown>haul</FONT></I> can also apply to the profits from any venture, legal or illegal: counting up his <I><FONT color=brown>haul</FONT></I> from the dry-cleaning agency.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Spoils</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>loot</FONT></I>, once referred to goods seized in war, although it could refer as well to land so acquired. Occasionally it is used in the singular. Its most common meaning now is money or advantages acquired through corrupt or fraudulent practices: Financiers involved in a mining swindle fell out over the division of the spoils. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>spoils</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>loot</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>booty</FONT></B> has not acquired latter-day uses and still refers specifically only to goods seized in war; in international law, it specifically applies to goods seized on land rather than at sea. It is sometimes used figuratively for any acquisition, especially one taken by violence or robbery.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Plunder">PLUNDER</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to persons who are in authority over others. <B><FONT color=blue>Boss</FONT></B> is a colloquial word that originated in the United States and in its strictest sense applies to an employer, foreman or manger of a group of workmen. By extension it has also become a popular term for any executive, supervisor or immediate superior: the <I><FONT color=brown>boss</FONT></I> of a large clothing store. <I><FONT color=brown>Boss</FONT></I> may also apply to any person who is in control of things, whether by prerogative or by tyrannical behaviour. [A horse must understand who is <I><FONT color=brown>boss</FONT></I>; Many parents discover that a spoilt child has become <I><FONT color=brown>boss</FONT></I> of the household.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chief</FONT></B>, the most comprehensive of these words, can be applied to anyone who occupies the position of highest authority over a group, large or small: the editor in <I><FONT color=brown>chief</FONT></I> of a newspaper; the <I><FONT color=brown>chief</FONT></I> architect of the housing project. However, <I><FONT color=brown>chief</FONT></I> is more commonly used of the supervisor of some department of established government: a <I><FONT color=brown>chief</FONT></I> of staff; the <I><FONT color=brown>chief</FONT></I> inspector of weights and measures. <I><FONT color=brown>Chief</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>boss</FONT></I> are sometimes used interchangeably: I need my <I><FONT color=brown>chief’s</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>boss’s</FONT></I>) signature on these contracts. In its original sense, a <I><FONT color=brown>chief</FONT></I> is the ruler of a primitive or nomadic tribe.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Head</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>chief</FONT></I>, is also a general term, but it is usually used of people who hold a more subordinate position than does a <I><FONT color=brown>chief</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>head</FONT></I> of the telegraph office; the <I><FONT color=brown>head</FONT></I> of a boys?school; to be the <I><FONT color=brown>head</FONT></I> of one’s class.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>leader</FONT></B> is one who is voluntarily followed because of an ability to guide and control others or because he has been chosen by a group or party to be its <I><FONT color=brown>head</FONT></I>. One tends to think of a <I><FONT color=brown>leader’s</FONT></I> having arrived at his position mainly because of his talent for influencing others and for acting as a guiding force: the <I><FONT color=brown>leader</FONT></I> of the German Reich; a <I><FONT color=brown>leader</FONT></I> in the fashion world; the <I><FONT color=brown>leader</FONT></I> of a labour movement.</P><P>In its commonest sense a <B><FONT color=blue>master</FONT></B> is a person who has been given the authority to enforce obedience, but the word does not suggest the innate ability of the leader to guide and influence others. A <I><FONT color=brown>master</FONT></I> may be one who employs servants, is a male teacher at a school, or owns an animal, such as a dog, who can be trained to obey him. <I><FONT color=brown>Master</FONT></I> is also the formal title for the captain of a merchant ship. A teacher or leader in philosophy, religion, etc., who has followers or disciples is often called a <I><FONT color=brown>master</FONT></I>, as is Jesus by many Christians. <I><FONT color=brown>Master</FONT></I> is also applied to people of exceptional skill or artistic ability; a <I><FONT color=brown>master</FONT></I> plumber; the old <I><FONT color=brown>masters</FONT></I> of Renaissance painting; a <I><FONT color=brown>master</FONT></I> of the keyboard.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Commander</FONT></B> is narrower in its meaning than are the other words of this group. Originally, it meant one who commands, as a leader, chief, etc.; now it applies almost exclusively to highly placed personnel in the armed forces. In the Navy, a <I><FONT color=brown>commander</FONT></I> is an officer ranking next below a captain. The officer in charge of a military post is also called a <I><FONT color=brown>commander</FONT></I>, or <I><FONT color=brown>commanding officer</FONT></I>. The person holding supreme command of all the armed forces of a nation (as the Governor-General in Australia and New Zealand) is called a <I><FONT color=brown>commander in chief</FONT></I>, as is any high-ranking officer in charge of a fleet or a major force.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Maestro</FONT></B> (from the Italian for <I><FONT color=brown>master</FONT></I>) is used of a person who is highly proficient in an artistic field; but it is now most often used of an eminent conductor, composer or performer in music. <I><FONT color=brown>Maestro</FONT></I> sometimes carries overtones of affectionate veneration, as in its application to the late Arturo Toscanini.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Assistant">ASSISTANT</A>, dependant, follower, servant, subordinate, underling.</P>

<P>These words imply one of two situations: either one in which a person is actively annoying another or to a situation in which a person is upset by something not necessarily the actions of someone else. Some of these words can carry either the active or passive implication; other are mainly restricted to one sense or the other.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bother</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>disturb</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>plague</FONT></B> are often used in both active and passive senses. On the passive scale, <I><FONT color=brown>bother</FONT></I> usually indicates a minor complaint that may come and go: frequently <I><FONT color=brown>bothered</FONT></I> by a slight stiffness in his joints. <I><FONT color=brown>Disturb</FONT></I> is more intense, suggesting specifically, at its most extreme, mental derangement: the mentally <I><FONT color=brown>disturbed</FONT></I> delinquent. In milder uses, <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I> points to a state of upset more thoroughgoing than that of <I><FONT color=brown>bother</FONT></I>: I was <I><FONT color=brown>bothered</FONT></I> by the lack of news at first, but now, after a month, I am really disturbed. <I><FONT color=brown>Plague</FONT></I>, in its passive sense, is perhaps the most intense of all these words, but suggests a specific kind of upset, one that repeatedly hammers inside the mind without pause. The person who is <I><FONT color=brown>plagued</FONT></I> ?by thoughts or by conditions around him ?is by implication in control neither of the things that hound or harry him nor of their recurrence within his possibly unstable mind: <I><FONT color=brown>plagued</FONT></I> by constant recollections of his long-dead wife; <I><FONT color=brown>plagued</FONT></I> by the odour in the packing plant; <I><FONT color=brown>plagued</FONT></I> by a continual lack of money.</P><P>These same three words ?<I><FONT color=brown>bother</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>plague</FONT></I> ?give a somewhat different scale of effects in their active senses. In this case, <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I> is the weakest in intensity. One person, for example, may <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I> another unintentionally by actions not directed specifically to the latter: Did my whistling disturb you? <I><FONT color=brown>Bother</FONT></I>, here, is stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I>, since an implication is present that the action may be done intentionally to <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I>: Just pay the bill and I'll stop <I><FONT color=brown>bothering</FONT></I> you. <I><FONT color=brown>Plague</FONT></I> is even stronger in the active voice than in the passive, suggesting repeated, deliberate annoyances that may have an almost demoniacal insistence: The bill collector <I><FONT color=brown>plagued</FONT></I> us with unrelenting phone calls, visits and threats.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Trouble</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>worry</FONT></B> are largely confined to the passive implication of being upset about something. [I am <I><FONT color=brown>troubled</FONT></I> by the doctor’s report; I’m <I><FONT color=brown>worried</FONT></I> that I'll fail in the exam.] Both words are more forceful than the passive use of <I><FONT color=brown>bother</FONT></I> but less so than the same use of <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Trouble</FONT></I> is slightly more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>worry</FONT></I> and suggests a definite cause for alarm; <I><FONT color=brown>worry</FONT></I> suggests less clear-cut reasons for uneasiness, specifically implying suspense over the outcome of something. <I><FONT color=brown>Trouble</FONT></I> is also more inclusive; one may be <I><FONT color=brown>troubled</FONT></I> without indulging in the helpless wasted motions of thought implied by <I><FONT color=brown>worry</FONT></I>.</P><P>In contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>pester</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>harass</FONT></B> are almost exclusively restricted to the active sense of someone annoying another person. [The platoon sergeant constantly <I><FONT color=brown>harassed</FONT></I> his men in ingeniously excruciating ways; Stop <I><FONT color=brown>pestering</FONT></I> me!] Both words are more forceful than the active use of <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I> and even of <I><FONT color=brown>bother</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Pester</FONT></I> is like the active use of plague in suggesting repeated and deliberate annoyances that interrupt someone else, but remains restricted mainly to trivial matters. <I><FONT color=brown>Harass</FONT></I> is considerably stronger, even carrying the possibility of physical punishment or worse: guerillas nightly <I><FONT color=brown>harassing</FONT></I> the border villages. <I><FONT color=brown>Harass</FONT></I> may even be stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>plague</FONT></I> in this case, since the latter stops short of any implication of physical violence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anger">ANGER</A>, <A href="entry://Enrage">ENRAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Upset">UPSET</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: comfort, console, placate, solace.</P>

<P>These words denote a line that marks the outermost part of an area, or a division between areas. <B><FONT color=blue>Boundary</FONT></B> is used chiefly of territory, and suggests a definite demarcation, such as a line or mark that can be precisely located on a map. <B><FONT color=blue>Bounds</FONT></B> are less definite, and may be used figuratively of behaviour: His impudence exceeds all <I><FONT color=brown>bounds</FONT></I>. In military usage <I><FONT color=brown>out of bounds</FONT></I> serves to notify military personnel not to enter the building or area so stigmatized. This use is extended to any area forbidden to certain persons: The girl’s recreation area in the school is <I><FONT color=brown>out of bounds</FONT></I> to boys. The colloquial expression <I><FONT color=brown>out of bounds</FONT></I>, derived from its use in various sports, is commonly used with the meaning of unfair, improper or indecent: Holding hands was <I><FONT color=brown>out of bounds</FONT></I>, and as for kissing ?that was unthinkable.</P><P>Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>boundary</FONT></I> points to an outermost limit, <B><FONT color=blue>border</FONT></B> emphasizes the division between two areas: the <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I> between the U.S.S.R. and Finland. [He crossed the <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I> into Belgium; By international agreement the <I><FONT color=brown>boundary</FONT></I> of each nation fronting a body of water extends exactly three miles from the coastline.] <I><FONT color=brown>Border</FONT></I> often suggests a territorial feature, such as a river or mountain range, and hence is not as precise as <I><FONT color=brown>boundary</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Boundaries</FONT></I> may be changed by treaties, i.e. on paper; <I><FONT color=brown>borders</FONT></I> may change by the changing course of a river or by military action.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Limit</FONT></B> is the most general term of this group, and can be applied to any outermost extent, range, demarcation, etc. as here considered the term is usually plural: to pass beyond the city <I><FONT color=brown>limits</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Frontier</FONT></B> may refer to the part of a nation’s territory lying along the <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I> of another country; it thus describes the <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I> region of a country from an interior perspective. <I><FONT color=brown>Frontier</FONT></I> also means the part of a settled region lying along the border of an unsettled region; the <I><FONT color=brown>frontier</FONT></I> towns of the American Wild West. <I><FONT color=brown>Frontier</FONT></I> is often used in extended senses; beyond the <I><FONT color=brown>frontier</FONT></I> of knowledge; at the <I><FONT color=brown>frontier</FONT></I> of space exploration.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Confines</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>bounds</FONT></I>, defines the extent of an area without reference to what lies beyond, but <I><FONT color=brown>confines</FONT></I> is less consistently restricted to the description of geographical <I><FONT color=brown>limits</FONT></I>: He was not permitted to pass beyond the <I><FONT color=brown>confines</FONT></I> of his room. <I><FONT color=brown>Confines</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>bounds</FONT></I>, is commonly used figuratively: His genius soared beyond the narrow <I><FONT color=brown>confines</FONT></I> of his education; beyond all <I><FONT color=brown>bounds</FONT></I> of decency or common sense.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Circumscribe">CIRCUMSCRIBE</A>, <A href="entry://Edge">EDGE</A>, <A href="entry://Perimeter">PERIMETER</A>.</P>

<P>These words involve the showing of favour either out of generosity or out of respect from achievement. <B><FONT color=blue>Award</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>prize</FONT></B> are now nearly identical in meaning, although prize is less formal in tone. Both refer to a tribute given for some outstanding accomplishment. Both may or may not imply the giving of sum of money. [The Olympic winner received a gold medal as an <I><FONT color=brown>award</FONT></I>; An <I><FONT color=brown>award</FONT></I> of two thousand dollars accompanied the <I><FONT color=brown>prize</FONT></I> for the best novel of the year.] <I><FONT color=brown>Prize</FONT></I> may also signify the objective or attainment of a struggle. [The company took the hill after an all-night battle, but it was a costly <I><FONT color=brown>prize</FONT></I>; Although he had not guessed it when he proposed, his wife turned out to be quite a <I><FONT color=brown>prize</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Honour</FONT></B> is more general than the foregoing. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>award</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>prize</FONT></I> may suggest an official ceremony of recognition, <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> may share this implication or depart from it to indicate simply private, unofficial respect. [The visiting head of state was given the <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> of a twenty-one gun salute; it is an <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> to hear you speak so highly of me.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Premium</FONT></B> is most specific in meaning, referring to an additional value beyond an agreed-on sum, the <I><FONT color=brown>premium</FONT></I> being given when a further condition has been met: The gave him a <I><FONT color=brown>premium</FONT></I> for selling the most insurance that month.

<P>These words pertain to the mental capacities or qualities of people. <B><FONT color=blue>Mind</FONT></B> is the most general and most neutral. It may refer exclusively to mental facility; in this case it is usually qualified to indicate how strong or weak such facility is: challenges that stimulate those students with good <I><FONT color=brown>minds</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>mind</FONT></I> too dull to grasp present-day scientific theories. The word can also refer to a bundle of mostly conscious attitudes (including the will), or to the whole psyche, conscious or unconscious, and its powers of comprehension, analysis and inquiry: those who have set their <I><FONT color=brown>minds</FONT></I> against intolerance; a <I><FONT color=brown>mind</FONT></I> afflicted by irrational impulses; a statesman with a great <I><FONT color=brown>mind</FONT></I>. It is also used in philosophy to denote the sum of man’s mental faculties, including those supposedly independent of the physical brain and nervous system: <I><FONT color=brown>mind</FONT></I> over matter. The remaining words are all more nearly restricted to mental ability or rational faculties alone.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intellect</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>intelligence</FONT></B> both refer more exactly and more formally than mind to mental ability. <I><FONT color=brown>Intellect</FONT></I> is usually applied only to man, and suggests a loftier, more finely developed and more esteemed faculty than the more widely used <I><FONT color=brown>intelligence</FONT></I>, which generally denotes innate capacity to perform mental tasks, to remember, to solve problems and to perceive relationships. [Dr. Smith is a man of great <I><FONT color=brown>intelligence</FONT></I> but Professor Brown earns the respect of his colleagues for his high <I><FONT color=brown>intellect</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Intelligence</FONT></I> is also the term preferred to suggest lack of mental skills or the degree to which they are possessed singly or in combination: a class of low <I><FONT color=brown>intelligence</FONT></I>; weak in mechanical skills but reflecting above-average <I><FONT color=brown>intelligence</FONT></I>; tests to determine verbal <I><FONT color=brown>intelligence</FONT></I> in pre-school children.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brains</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>head</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wits</FONT></B> are all very informal words for aspects of intelligence. <I><FONT color=brown>Head</FONT></I>, the most restricted, usually pertains to a single faculty, often of a practical nature: a good <I><FONT color=brown>head</FONT></I> for figures; keeping a cool head throughout the crisis. <I><FONT color=brown>Brains</FONT></I> suggests a wider scope, like intelligence, but often refers to mental ability that has practical results: It takes <I><FONT color=brown>brains</FONT></I> to land a cushy job. Wits refers specifically to alertness or sensitivity rather than to a general mental facility: warning him to keep his wits about him. Like <I><FONT color=brown>mind</FONT></I>, it can also refer to the conscious or rational intelligence: scared out of her wits. <I><FONT color=brown>Nous</FONT></I> is even more informal than brains for general intelligence and common sense. While conveying some suggestion of cunning it is not a pejorative term and usually combines the notions of practical common sense and intellectual ability: With his <I><FONT color=brown>nous</FONT></I> he is sure to get the job he wants.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Reason</FONT></B> refers solely to the objective, rational part of the mind; it is one aspect of intelligence. In use, it is referred to as though it were a technique, rather than a faculty: using <I><FONT color=brown>reason</FONT></I> to trace the murderer from the clues surrounding the crime. The word may also, like one use of <I><FONT color=brown>wits</FONT></I>, refer in a common-sense way to normal sanity: lost his <I><FONT color=brown>reason</FONT></I>. As an abstract noun, it can indicate a rational, unemotional, open-minded approach: the hope that <I><FONT color=brown>reason</FONT></I> rather than prejudice would prevail in the community.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Acumen">ACUMEN</A>, <A href="entry://Keen">KEEN</A>.</P>

Direct <I><FONT color=brown>steaming</FONT></I> is usually accomplished by placing a metal rack above the level of shallow boiling water in a pot so that the food does not touch the water: to <I><FONT color=brown>steam</FONT></I> fish; to <I><FONT color=brown>steam</FONT></I> vegetables. Poach implies a method of cooking a few foods, such as eggs without their shells, or pieces of chicken or fish, by dropping them into hot water, milk or stock and <I><FONT color=brown>simmering</FONT></I> until done.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stew</FONT></B> is a close synonym of <I><FONT color=brown>simmer</FONT></I> in that both mean to cook slowly in liquid over low heat; to <I><FONT color=brown>stew</FONT></I> prunes. However, to most people, <I><FONT color=brown>stew</FONT></I> strongly suggests the familiar dish that is cooked in this way -- meat combined with vegetables in a gravy or sauce. <I><FONT color=brown>Stewing</FONT></I> always involves simmering, but one may <I><FONT color=brown>simmer</FONT></I> (not stew) soups, vegetables, sauces, etc.</P><P>When cooks speak of <I><FONT color=brown>stewing</FONT></I> meat, they usually mean to <B><FONT color=blue>braise</FONT></B> it. <I><FONT color=brown>Braise</FONT></I> implies the browning of meat (and often of accompanying vegetables) in a small amount of fat prior to adding a stock or other liquid and <I><FONT color=brown>simmering</FONT></I> in a covered pan.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fry</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sauté</FONT></B> are closely related in that the food is cooked in hot fat. <I><FONT color=brown>Sautéing</FONT></I>, is done very quickly with a minimum amount of fat and may or may not imply browning. Meat is usually <I><FONT color=brown>sautéed</FONT></I> before it is <I><FONT color=brown>braised</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Frying</FONT></I> suggests cooking in greater amounts of fat than that used in <I><FONT color=brown>sautéing</FONT></I>, and may be done in a pan containing up to one or two inches of fat or in a pot designed for deep <I><FONT color=brown>frying</FONT></I>, in which large amounts of fat are used. <B><FONT color=blue>Dry-frying</FONT></B> is the complete cooking of meat (chops, steak, etc.) by <I><FONT color=brown>frying</FONT></I> slowly in little or no fat.

<P>These words are synonyms when they mean to move something rapidly back and forth or in circles. <B><FONT color=blue>Brandish</FONT></B> means to wave or shake a weapon, especially in public, so as to threaten or intimidate someone: The drunk at the bar suddenly <I><FONT color=brown>brandished</FONT></I> a gun, and everybody scrambled for cover. <B><FONT color=blue>Flourish</FONT></B> implies a display of self-confidence, triumph or merely high-spirits: The victorious army flourished a captured flag.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Swing</FONT></B>, in this sense, means to move rhythmically to and fro or backwards and forwards, like the pendulum of a clock or the clapper of a bell. It may imply a wide, sweeping motion, even rotation: to <I><FONT color=brown>swing</FONT></I> an axe; Huckleberry Finn recommended <I><FONT color=brown>swinging</FONT></I> a dead cat over one’s head to cure warts. <B><FONT color=blue>Wield</FONT></B> emphasizes the command one has over the sue of a weapon or instrument: to <I><FONT color=brown>wield</FONT></I> a hammer and chisel; to <I><FONT color=brown>wield</FONT></I> forceps with consummate skill. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>wield</FONT></I> approaches brandish in meaning: He turned to towards me and suddenly <I><FONT color=brown>wielded</FONT></I> a short, ugly knife.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: arrest, hang, suspend.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>brashness</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>brass</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cheek</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gall</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hide</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>nerve</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sauciness</FONT></B>:

<P>These words describe shameless, bold or arrogantly brusque behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Brashness</FONT></B> indicates a decisive, insistently aggressive or come-what-may attitude. When the word is approving, it expresses wonder or admiration for someone’s audacity and zest; more commonly, it is used to criticize a rash lack of judgement or a lack of consideration for others: the <I><FONT color=brown>brashness</FONT></I> of such a small country in successfully defending itself against its enemies; a foolhardy <I><FONT color=brown>brashness</FONT></I> that often tempted him to tackle situations he knew nothing about; the <I><FONT color=brown>brashness</FONT></I> with which he pushed his way to the top of the heap, injuring the feelings of everyone else in the office. The word can also point to a garish vulgarity of taste: The <I><FONT color=brown>brashness</FONT></I> of his sports clothes almost made my eyeballs ache. <B><FONT color=blue>Sauciness</FONT></B> suggests, instead, an imperious, insouciant and haughty manner, often exhibited in an inferior or in someone replying sharply or out of turn: the <I><FONT color=brown>sauciness</FONT></I> of that impertinent little salesgirl; the indignant <I><FONT color=brown>sauciness</FONT></I> with which he refused to take his nap. Often, the word can be used humorously or affectionately to describe the spirited display of someone who is weak or powerless: the roguish <I><FONT color=brown>sauciness</FONT></I> of a small kitten: the boy’s <I><FONT color=brown>sauciness</FONT></I> in grandly declining to play house with his older sister.</P><P>The remaining words are all extremely informal words for the idea of brazen insolence and self-seeking. Of these, however, only <B><FONT color=blue>nerve</FONT></B> can function with either positive or negative force. When approving, the word points to cool self-possession and courage in acting against odds: It took <I><FONT color=brown>nerve</FONT></I> for him to stand up for his rights in an atmosphere thick with recrimination and threats of reprisal. In disapproval, <I><FONT color=brown>nerve</FONT></I> suggests a shameless disregard for good taste or manners: Imagine the <I><FONT color=brown>nerve</FONT></I> of him, asking her to stay with him for the night! <B><FONT color=blue>Brass</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hide</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cheek</FONT></B> indicate an insistent and insolent self-assurance. <I><FONT color=brown>Brass</FONT></I> is the most disapproving of the three, suggesting a coarse or ingrained lack of sensitivity to the feelings of others: He had the <I><FONT color=brown>brass</FONT></I> to tell me I had no right to correct him. <I><FONT color=brown>Hide</FONT></I> is less strong but still has a connotation of deliberately insensitive behaviour: the <I><FONT color=brown>hide</FONT></I> of him, arriving 40 minutes late. <I><FONT color=brown>Cheek</FONT></I> is milder in suggesting a smug self-regard that prompts uncritical, brazen or tasteless behaviour: the <I><FONT color=brown>cheek</FONT></I> to ask for a rise after a week in his new job. Like <I><FONT color=brown>sauciness</FONT></I>, the word can be used humorously or affectionately for a cute forwardness in one’s inferiors: the <I><FONT color=brown>cheek</FONT></I> of the boy in asking for another helping of dessert. <B><FONT color=blue>Gall</FONT></B> is the most severely disapproving of all these words, suggesting shameless acts of unwarranted discourtesy: the <I><FONT color=brown>gall</FONT></I> to invite himself to tea. But the word is very general, applying to any act one dislikes.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conceited">CONCEITED</A>, EFFR0NTERY, <A href="entry://Overbearing">OVERBEARING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: civility, meekness, politeness, self-effacement.</P>

<P>These words indicate a readiness to face danger, difficulty or even death when called upon by circumstances to do so. <B><FONT color=blue>Brave</FONT></B> is the most general word. It indicates the showing of one’s mettle under stress, implying self-possession and resolution. <B><FONT color=blue>Courageous</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>brave</FONT></I>, may focus on response to a situation, but it often implies firmness arising from strong moral convictions. Both words imply a willingness to proceed with the necessary in spite of external deterrents or internal misgivings. A <I><FONT color=brown>brave</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>courageous</FONT></I> soldier carries out a dangerous mission, not without fear, but without letting fear prevent him from doing his duty.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dauntless</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>undaunted</FONT></B> indicate bravery under exceptionally trying circumstances. Both imply a refusal to be disheartened, intimidated or otherwise discouraged from going on. [Scientists pursue their experiments with <I><FONT color=brown>dauntless</FONT></I> determination, despite repeated failures and disappointments; Stalemated negotiators must resume their talks each day with <I><FONT color=brown>undaunted</FONT></I> optimism.] <B><FONT color=blue>Fearless</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>intrepid</FONT></B> imply a resolute freedom from fear or a cool, unshakable determination. [A <I><FONT color=brown>fearless</FONT></I>, crusading newspaper exposes corruption in high places without being deterred by the danger of reprisal; The <I><FONT color=brown>intrepid</FONT></I> explorers hacked their way through the jungle in spite of the constant danger of native attack.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Valiant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>valorous</FONT></B> are applied to persons and actions that exhibit the kind of courage and fortitude associated with knighthood. <I><FONT color=brown>Valiant</FONT></I> may suggest bravery shown in a worthy cause, against impossible odds, or with commendable consequences. <I><FONT color=brown>Valorous</FONT></I> is usually applied to the spirit or deeds of the <I><FONT color=brown>valiant</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>valiant</FONT></I> fireman may save persons trapped in a burning building by a valorous disregard of his own safety.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Heroic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>gallant</FONT></B> outstanding bravery coupled with nobility of motive or selfless dedication. <I><FONT color=brown>Heroic</FONT></I> stresses exceptional courage, fortitude or enterprise, especially in time of war or danger. It implies a willingness to risk or sacrifice one’s life to save another or others. <I><FONT color=brown>Gallant</FONT></I> implies inner nobility that is manifested in chivalrous action. [The storming of Gallipoli was a <I><FONT color=brown>heroic</FONT></I> action of <I><FONT color=brown>gallant</FONT></I> men.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Plucky</FONT></B> is a somewhat informal word, usually applied to contenders who persist against unfavourable odds. A <I><FONT color=brown>plucky</FONT></I> prize-fighter does his best to hold his own against a heavier, more skilful opponent. <B><FONT color=blue>Bold</FONT></B> indicates an actively brave nature or a confident audacity. The <I><FONT color=brown>bold</FONT></I> man is daring and is undeterred by fear of consequences: the R.A.F.’s <I><FONT color=brown>bold</FONT></I> bombing of the Ruhr dams in 1943 spread destruction across Germany’s industrial heartland.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bold">BOLD</A>, <A href="entry://Daring">DARING</A>, <A href="entry://Reckless">RECKLESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Afraid">AFRAID</A>, <A href="entry://Cowardly">COWARDLY</A>, daunted, intimidated, <A href="entry://Timid">TIMID</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the forcible destruction, breaching or injury of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Break</FONT></B> is the most general word. It most often suggests the separation of a rigid body into pieces, implying either partial or total destruction of a whole: <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> the firewood in two for easier burning; <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> a vase by accident. <I><FONT color=brown>Break</FONT></I> may also indicate a temporary injury, as to a bone: <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> a leg in a fall. And it may involve getting free from some restraint or enclosure: to <I><FONT color=brown>break</FONT></I> out of goal; buds <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> open. <B><FONT color=blue>Burst</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>break</FONT></I> in this latter sense but involves much greater violence. It is highly specific word, suggesting a forceful <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> open that is due to internal pressure: squeezing a pimple until it <I><FONT color=brown>bursts</FONT></I> open; a dam so weakened by floods that it finally <I><FONT color=brown>burst</FONT></I>; blowing up a balloon until it <I><FONT color=brown>bursts</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crack</FONT></B> usually means to <I><FONT color=brown>break</FONT></I> without separation of parts. It suggests the <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> out across a surface of slit-like openings or hairline ruptures, either because of wear, age or pressure: a window that he <I><FONT color=brown>cracked</FONT></I> by leaning against it; a <I><FONT color=brown>cracked</FONT></I> cup; linoleum that had faded and <I><FONT color=brown>cracked</FONT></I>. In other uses, <I><FONT color=brown>crack</FONT></I> may mean to <I><FONT color=brown>break</FONT></I> apart or <I><FONT color=brown>break</FONT></I> into pieces: <I><FONT color=brown>Cracking</FONT></I> open the walnut without <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> the kernel. <B><FONT color=blue>Fracture</FONT></B> can suggest a deeper, more thorough, but also more localized <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>crack</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>fracturing</FONT></I> the bone in two places; boulders <I><FONT color=brown>fractured</FONT></I> by continual freezing and thawing; old habit patterns <I><FONT color=brown>fractured</FONT></I> by changing technology.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shatter</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>shiver</FONT></B> most often suggest a total <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> up of a thin surface. <I><FONT color=brown>Shatter</FONT></I> is the more general of the two, implying the breaking of such a surface into sharp pieces or jagged fragments: heavy enough to <I><FONT color=brown>shatter</FONT></I> the melting ice; a well-aimed stone that <I><FONT color=brown>shattered</FONT></I> the already cracked window. The word can, however, refer to the <I><FONT color=brown>breaking</FONT></I> of any brittle object, in which case, it suggests reduction to many fairly small pieces: a marble statue that had been completely <I><FONT color=brown>shattered</FONT></I> in the earthquake. <I><FONT color=brown>Shiver</FONT></I>, by contrast, is more closely restricted to glass or glass-like surfaces, suggesting a reduction into long, narrow shards or <I><FONT color=brown>slivers</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>shivering</FONT></I> the mirror. The word might now seem outdated except as a noun.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crush</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>smash</FONT></B> suggest forceful action taken to destroy or <I><FONT color=brown>break</FONT></I> something. <I><FONT color=brown>Crush</FONT></I> points to the effect of great external pressure: it suggests squeezing something out of shape: <I><FONT color=brown>crushing</FONT></I> the empty cigarette packed in one hand; eggs that had been <I><FONT color=brown>crushed</FONT></I> by tinned goods placed on top of them in the carton. <I><FONT color=brown>Smash</FONT></I> describes the kind of complete deformation resulting from a heavy, noisy blow. This word suggests the <I><FONT color=brown>shattering</FONT></I> of something brittle either by throwing it or by throwing something against it: <I><FONT color=brown>smashing</FONT></I> the window with his bare fist: He <I><FONT color=brown>smashed</FONT></I> the bottle to smithereens against the rocks.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Crack">CRACK</A>, <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, <A href="entry://Explode">EXPLODE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: CONNECT <A href="entry://Repair">REPAIR</A>, weld.</P>

<P>All these words refer most specifically to the intense, steady light emitted from a source, rather than to wavering or reflected light. <B><FONT color=blue>Bright</FONT></B> is the most general of these, stressing chiefly the intensity of the light: the bright stars. It is more useful than the other words as a comparative: the <I><FONT color=brown>brighter</FONT></I> of the two neon signs. In its very generality, <I><FONT color=brown>bright</FONT></I> permits reference to wavering or reflected light, but only to emphasize intensity: a <I><FONT color=brown>bright</FONT></I>, cheerful fire; sun-<I><FONT color=brown>bright</FONT></I> ripples. <B><FONT color=blue>Brilliant</FONT></B> lends itself to the same uses as <I><FONT color=brown>bright</FONT></I>, but suggests even greater intensity: <I><FONT color=brown>brilliant</FONT></I> head-lights. <I><FONT color=brown>Brilliant</FONT></I> can have a lyrical quality absent in the more matter-of-fact <I><FONT color=brown>bright</FONT></I>, and consequently it can imply excellence or beauty: the <I><FONT color=brown>brilliant</FONT></I>, cloudless day.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Incandescent</FONT></B> suggests light created specifically by combustion, and it may or may not carry overtones of emitted warmth as well as light. <I><FONT color=brown>Incandescent</FONT></I> may simply refer technically to a white-hot light: an <I><FONT color=brown>incandescent</FONT></I> lamp. In other uses it suggests fierceness or intense whiteness rather than the excellence or beauty of <I><FONT color=brown>brilliant</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>incandescent</FONT></I> glare of the street lights.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Resplendent</FONT></B> is in every way an intensification of brilliant; though more formal, it is even more lyrical, stressing vivid <I><FONT color=brown>brightness</FONT></I> and dazzling splendour: the <I><FONT color=brown>resplendent</FONT></I> sun; a sky <I><FONT color=brown>resplendent</FONT></I> with stars. <I><FONT color=brown>Resplendent</FONT></I> can refer to sources of reflected light as well, but with the same lyrical force and implication of lustre, bedecked with diamonds and <I><FONT color=brown>resplendent</FONT></I> in her jewelled gown.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Effulgent</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>resplendent</FONT></I> in lyricism and formality except that it is more precisely restricted to sources of light. Also, its extreme formality may make its use seem inflated or pretentious: <I><FONT color=brown>effulgent</FONT></I> rays streaming through the thunderhead.</P><P>While far less formal than <I><FONT color=brown>resplendent</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>effulgent</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>shining</FONT></B> as an adjective has been so overworked when used with lyrical intent that it may now strike one as a cliché in most contexts: a knight in <I><FONT color=brown>shining</FONT></I> armour. <I><FONT color=brown>Shining</FONT></I> may escape this liability when it is merely descriptive: the <I><FONT color=brown>shining</FONT></I> beacon far out at sea. Used in such a way, it contrasts with all the foregoing words by describing light that need not necessarily be intense. <B><FONT color=blue>Glowing</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>radiant</FONT></B>, similarly, do not emphasize intensity. <I><FONT color=brown>Glowing</FONT></I> suggests a slow burning or the last stage of burning; it implies warmth as well, but faintness of both light and warmth may be the point of its use: the <I><FONT color=brown>glowing</FONT></I> remains of a fire. <I><FONT color=brown>Radiant</FONT></I> suggests the emission of light in all directions; it carries a unique connotation of mild, gentle warmth: a <I><FONT color=brown>radiant</FONT></I> spring day, so unlike those of <I><FONT color=brown>incandescent</FONT></I> summer. <B><FONT color=blue>Beaming</FONT></B> refers specifically to light sent out in long arms, either stationary or sweeping: the <I><FONT color=brown>beaming</FONT></I> searchlight.</P><P>All these words can refer figuratively to qualities of personality, intelligence or passion. Indeed, their metaphorical use has been extensive in describing all that is good or desirable in human nature ?perhaps a comment on the high value man has continued to place on light. In brief, <I><FONT color=brown>bright</FONT></I> refers to intelligence, but more as potential than as accomplishment: a <I><FONT color=brown>bright</FONT></I> student. <I><FONT color=brown>Brilliant</FONT></I> goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>bright</FONT></I> to indicate great intellect or talent. It may also refer to a highly admired accomplishment or illustrious achievement: a <I><FONT color=brown>brilliant</FONT></I> novel. <I><FONT color=brown>Resplendent</FONT></I> may suggest the blaze and <I><FONT color=brown>brilliance</FONT></I> of triumph or majesty: soldiers <I><FONT color=brown>resplendent</FONT></I> in victory. <I><FONT color=brown>Effulgent</FONT></I> may describe something that seems to radiate outwards like light: her <I><FONT color=brown>effulgent</FONT></I> loveliness. <I><FONT color=brown>Glowing</FONT></I> suggests their satisfaction ?or a being possessed by calmer, gentler feelings: eyes <I><FONT color=brown>glowing</FONT></I> with desire; a face <I><FONT color=brown>radiant</FONT></I> with tenderness. <I><FONT color=brown>Beaming</FONT></I> suggests pleasure or self-satisfaction, while <I><FONT color=brown>shining</FONT></I> in most of its figurative uses is decidedly trite.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Luminous">LUMINOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Sparkling">SPARKLING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dim, dull, <A href="entry://Gloomy">GLOOMY</A>, <A href="entry://Obscure">OBSCURE</A>, opaque.</P>

<P>These words refer to a religion’s clergy ?that is, those who lead a congregation in worship or belong to teaching or monastic orders. <B><FONT color=blue>Minister</FONT></B> refers exclusively to a Protestant clergyman who has been authorized to administer sacraments and conduct religious services. <B><FONT color=blue>Pastor</FONT></B> is used in Australia and New Zealand in reference to a <I><FONT color=brown>minister</FONT></I>, although not so commonly as in the United States. In a general, informal sense, it is used by all churches, as in "he is a good <I><FONT color=brown>pastor</FONT></I>," i.e. a good shepherd to his flock. The word is an official title in several denominations, notably the Church of Christ, Lutheran churches and some Baptist churches.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Preacher</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>reverend</FONT></B> also apply to the clergy of some Protestant faiths. <I><FONT color=brown>Preacher</FONT></I> is much more informal than the previous words and means simply a man who preaches or delivers a sermon; it has nothing to do with rank or title. [The <I><FONT color=brown>preacher</FONT></I> on Sunday will be the Rev. John Smith; The sedate congregation was clearly displeased by this fire-and-brimstone <I><FONT color=brown>preacher</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Reverend</FONT></I> may properly appear as part of a title or courtesy phrase: the <I><FONT color=brown>Reverend</FONT></I> Dr. Jones. It may appear in other set phrases before a name, such as the Right <I><FONT color=brown>Reverend</FONT></I> or the Most <I><FONT color=brown>Reverend</FONT></I>. It is incorrect when any such title is shortened to the one word alone: <I><FONT color=brown>Reverend</FONT></I> Johns. Use of the word as a noun, e.g., I shall phone the <I><FONT color=brown>reverend</FONT></I>, is also improper, although some people tend to address a <I><FONT color=brown>minister</FONT></I> directly as <I><FONT color=brown>Reverend</FONT></I>.</P><P>In Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, <B><FONT color=blue>priest</FONT></B> designates a member of the clergy who has been authorized to administer the sacraments; if he has a parish in his charge he may be referred to as a <I><FONT color=brown>pastor</FONT></I>, but in any case he may be addressed as <B><FONT color=blue>father</FONT></B>: <I><FONT color=brown>Father</FONT></I> Brown. [Good morning, <I><FONT color=brown>Father</FONT></I>.] The word is never used with an article, however, except to refer to the early founders of the church or, collectively, to its leaders: the church <I><FONT color=brown>fathers</FONT></I> who fought heresies on the one hand and persecution on the other; a meeting of the <I><FONT color=brown>fathers</FONT></I> of the church.</P><P>In these same faiths, <B><FONT color=blue>monk</FONT></B> refers to a man in holy orders, particularly monastic ones; such a man may or may not be a <I><FONT color=brown>priest</FONT></I> as well. If so, he would be referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>father</FONT></I>; if not, he would be referred to as <B><FONT color=blue>brother</FONT></B>. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>father</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>brother</FONT></I> may well be used with a definite article: the poet who became a <I><FONT color=brown>brother</FONT></I> in a Trappist monastery. <I><FONT color=brown>Monk</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>priest</FONT></I> both may refer to comparable roles in other religions of the world, past or present: a Buddhist <I><FONT color=brown>monk</FONT></I>; a Druid <I><FONT color=brown>priest</FONT></I>; a Tibetan <I><FONT color=brown>priest</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clergyman">CLERGYMAN</A>.</P>

<P>All these words point to a shortness or discourtesy of manner in a person’s treatment of others. <B><FONT color=blue>Brusque</FONT></B> derives from an Italian word meaning rude. It is applied to a noticeably short, brisk or terse manner that may or may not be rude, depending on intent and circumstance. [A no-nonsense woman, the governess gave her employer a <I><FONT color=brown>brusque</FONT></I> handshake; Being in a hurry, he made an unintentionally <I><FONT color=brown>brusque</FONT></I> reply.] At worst, <I><FONT color=brown>brusque</FONT></I> may imply incivility, ungracious sharpness or undue severity: a <I><FONT color=brown>brusque</FONT></I> dismissal. <B><FONT color=blue>Bluff</FONT></B>, by contrast, is not at all negative in tone but implies a hearty frankness ?an openness that may lack finesse but does not intend discourtesy. <I><FONT color=brown>Bluff</FONT></I> is used almost exclusively to describe men. The <I><FONT color=brown>bluff</FONT></I> man talks and laughs loudly and freely, says and does whatever he pleases with fearless good nature, and with no thought of annoying or giving pain to others: A <I><FONT color=brown>bluff</FONT></I>, beefy man, he didn’t mince his words, but there was a twinkle in his eye. <B><FONT color=blue>Blunt</FONT></B> is fairly close to <I><FONT color=brown>bluff</FONT></I> at one extreme, though it can imply only a well-meaning directness. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>bluff</FONT></I>, however, <I><FONT color=brown>blunt</FONT></I> more often suggests a flat-footed forthrightness that verges on discourtesy. It may describe a manner of speech as well as a person. [Shall I lie politely to you, or shall I be <I><FONT color=brown>blunt</FONT></I>? Be as <I><FONT color=brown>blunt</FONT></I> as you like ?I won’t mind your rudeness if you tell me the truth.] At the other extreme, <I><FONT color=brown>blunt</FONT></I> may indicate a tactless frankness that is inconsiderate or needlessly cruel. The <I><FONT color=brown>blunt</FONT></I> man may say things which he is perfectly aware are disagreeable, either from a defiant indifference to others?feelings or from the pleasure of tormenting. <B><FONT color=blue>Short</FONT></B> has a connotation of quickness and directness, with a hint of anger and perhaps rudeness: I was very <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I> with him for asking such a foolish question.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abrupt</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>curt</FONT></B> both suggest an uncooperative terseness, especially in reply to a question or appeal for help. His laconic answers to my repeated requests for directions were both unfriendly and <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Abrupt</FONT></B> may also imply a disconcerting directness: an <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> refusal. <I><FONT color=brown>Curt</FONT></I> is stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I>, implying hardness or coldness of manner as well as a willful intent to be unpleasant: a <I><FONT color=brown>curt</FONT></I> rejoinder. [I can understand being a little <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> if one is really busy, but she’s always <I><FONT color=brown>curt</FONT></I> even when she’s just wasting her time.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gruff</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>surly</FONT></B> suggest bad-tempered or rude behaviour; but they need not imply either straightforwardness, as in <I><FONT color=brown>bluff</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>blunt</FONT></I>, or undue brevity of response, as in <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>curt</FONT></I>. Of the two words, <I><FONT color=brown>gruff</FONT></I> is more appropriately applied to a man and is most applicable to disposition. It describes one who is brusque, rough and crusty in manner or hoarse and guttural in speech. [He'll grumble for minutes at a time when he’s <I><FONT color=brown>gruff</FONT></I> and grouchy, but don’t expect a straight answer from him then.] <I><FONT color=brown>Surly</FONT></I> suggests extreme discourtesy and may be applied to either sex. It implies not so much a sour frame of mind as an abiding attitude of hostility to people ?a crabbed, churlish disposition evident in both speech and manner: a <I><FONT color=brown>surly</FONT></I>, insubordinate servant. [Give me the <I><FONT color=brown>gruffest</FONT></I> salesman in the world and I won’t complain ?just so long as I don’t have to put up with that <I><FONT color=brown>surly</FONT></I> woman in the lingerie department. I'll even take the <I><FONT color=brown>blunt</FONT></I> remarks about my figure from the woman in the dress department or the <I><FONT color=brown>curt</FONT></I> answers of the credit manager when I ask to pay by cheque.

<B><FONT color=blue>build</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>construct</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>erect</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fabricate</FONT></B>:

<P>These verbs all indicate the assembling and fitting together of materials into a structure. <B><FONT color=blue>Build</FONT></B>, the most general and least formal word, has the widest range of uses, from the most concrete and specific to the highly figurative and abstract. [Carpenters <I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I> houses and birds <I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I> nests; Cavemen <I><FONT color=brown>built</FONT></I> fires at the mouths of their caves; The company director hoped to <I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I> a business empire; Nations <I><FONT color=brown>built</FONT></I> their hopes for peace on the fear of nuclear war.] <B><FONT color=blue>Construct</FONT></B> has a much more limited range of application. It emphasizes the intricate or complex nature of a building process, where <I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I> may focus on the assembling of separate parts and the resulting connection: to <I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I> a bookcase; to <I><FONT color=brown>construct</FONT></I> an office building. The phrase to <I><FONT color=brown>build a bridge</FONT></I> emphasizes engineering problems and the workmen and equipment involved. The same distinctions hold with reference to mental activities ?<I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I> pointing to gradual, step-by-step creation through continued efforts. [Philosophers <I><FONT color=brown>construct</FONT></I> complicated systems for describing existence; Neurotics may be unable to <I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I> healthy relationships.] If substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I> in the last example, <I><FONT color=brown>construct</FONT></I> would have an unfortunate overtone of artificiality.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>build</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>erect</FONT></B> may involve the assembling of parts. <I><FONT color=brown>Erect</FONT></I>, however, chiefly stress height and vertical position, meaning to put or set something up: to <I><FONT color=brown>erect</FONT></I> a skyscraper; to <I><FONT color=brown>erect</FONT></I> a monument; They finally built a road up the Acrocorinth to the tower that had been <I><FONT color=brown>erected</FONT></I> centuries before. <I><FONT color=brown>Erect</FONT></I> also has figurative uses: to <I><FONT color=brown>erect</FONT></I> a tariff wall; to <I><FONT color=brown>erect</FONT></I> a trade barrier.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fabricate</FONT></B> has least the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>building</FONT></I> a structure on its intended location. In suggesting the assembly and fitting together of parts, it implies more the standardized manufacturing of smaller items in a factory: to <I><FONT color=brown>fabricate</FONT></I> parts for do-it-yourself furniture-making kits. Recent techniques of house-building have, of course, perfected the prefabrication of all units, which are then shipped and assembled on the spot. Unless this type of building or construction is meant, one would still not use <I><FONT color=brown>fabricate</FONT></I> of house or bridge building. In other uses, the word has taken on a strong negative overtone of artificiality or falsity: a friend who <I><FONT color=brown>fabricates</FONT></I> flimsy stories to conceal his irresponsibility.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, devastate.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Burn</FONT></B>, the general word, means to effect a change in an object through the action of heat or fire. The object may be changed only slightly, or it may be totally destroyed. [A cigarette <I><FONT color=brown>burned</FONT></I> the finish on the table; A fire <I><FONT color=brown>burned</FONT></I> the house down.] Although it usually connotes some degree of destruction, <I><FONT color=brown>burning</FONT></I> may accomplish a useful purpose. A householder <I><FONT color=brown>burns</FONT></I> fuel to heat the house. In autumn, a gardener <I><FONT color=brown>burns</FONT></I> leaves to dispose of them. Not only heat but also extreme cold, corrosive chemicals gases, electricity, radiation, friction and the like may cause the kind of surface change or stinging sensation associated with a <I><FONT color=brown>burn</FONT></I>. Hence, acid is said to <I><FONT color=brown>burn</FONT></I> the skin and a cutting wind may make the cheek <I><FONT color=brown>burn</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Burn</FONT></I> can also mean to cause a feeling of heat in a part of the body: The hot spices <I><FONT color=brown>burned</FONT></I> his mouth and tongue.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>scald</FONT></B> is to burn with a very hot liquid or steam. Thus, the careless cook may scald herself if she spills hot soup or boiling water.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Singe</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>scorch</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>char</FONT></B> are related in that they mean to burn partially, slightly or superficially. To <I><FONT color=brown>singe</FONT></I> is to <I><FONT color=brown>burn</FONT></I> the surface or ends of something: The fire <I><FONT color=brown>singed</FONT></I> his eyebrows. <I><FONT color=brown>Singeing</FONT></I> is sometimes done deliberately, as to remove bristles or to keep hair from splitting. A cook may <I><FONT color=brown>singe</FONT></I> a plucked chicken to remove pinfeathers by passing the fowl through an open flame. To <I><FONT color=brown>scorch</FONT></I> is to <I><FONT color=brown>burn</FONT></I> something to the point of discolouration, usually by hot metal: She <I><FONT color=brown>scorched</FONT></I> the dress by setting the iron too high for the fabric. <I><FONT color=brown>Char</FONT></I> may imply a more advanced stage of combustion. It means to reduce a substance to carbon, either completely, as in charcoal, or partially: Pieces of <I><FONT color=brown>charred</FONT></I> wood remained after the campfire had <I><FONT color=brown>burnt</FONT></I> out; the charred remains of a <I><FONT color=brown>burnt-down</FONT></I> house.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sear</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>brand</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cauterize</FONT></B> all connote deliberate <I><FONT color=brown>burning</FONT></I> to achieve a definite purpose. All are also used of flesh. Of the three, <I><FONT color=brown>sear</FONT></I> is the most general word, as it can mean both <I><FONT color=brown>brand</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>cauterize</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Searing</FONT></I> involves the subjecting of a surface to intense heat for a very short time. This may have the effect of hardening, sealing, drying up, destroying tissue or leaving an ineradicable imprint. [Before stewing the beef, the cook seared it over high heat to seal the juices in.] To brand is to sear with a hot iron, <I><FONT color=brown>burning</FONT></I> a mark into the flesh, as to signify ownership. A grazier <I><FONT color=brown>brands</FONT></I> his cattle so that he can identify them if they stray or are stolen. To <I><FONT color=brown>Cauterize</FONT></I> is to <I><FONT color=brown>sear</FONT></I> tissue with a <I><FONT color=brown>caustic</FONT></I> agent or heated iron for curative purposes. A doctor may <I><FONT color=brown>cauterize</FONT></I> a wound to prevent infection.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Combustible">COMBUSTIBLE</A>, <A href="entry://Hot">HOT</A>, <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>, <A href="entry://Stigma">STIGMA</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>busy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>active</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>engaged</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>engrossed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>occupied</FONT></B>:

<P>These adjectives all refer to activity or involvement. <B><FONT color=blue>Busy</FONT></B> is the least formal word. It may indicate nothing more than that a person is working on or doing something or that a thing is in use. [Mr. Brown is <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> right now; The line is <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I>.] Or it may imply constant, concentrated involvement in business or intensive and varied activity of any kind: a <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> man; a <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> day; a <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> market place; a <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> legislative session. The effort involved in being or staying <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> may be, by implication, valuable or productive: Get <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> and get something done. But in some cases, the word gives a special overtone of empty fuss and hollow results: <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> work to keep the troops out of trouble; kept <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> half the day by peddling neighbourhood gossip.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Active</FONT></B> stresses action, operation or involvement as opposed to passivity or dormancy: an <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> man; an <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> life; an <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> listing. <I><FONT color=brown>Active</FONT></I> accounts are productive and active investments yield interest. An <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> volcano is not extinct but may erupt, though it seldom does. Used of persons, active often points to actual work or participation as contrasted with mere approval or association: <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> on behalf of the spastic centre; <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> in community affairs; an <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> club members as opposed to a mere name on the rolls. A soldier on active duty is involved in military service on a full-time basis, but he may not be busy all the time. <I><FONT color=brown>Active</FONT></I> may also mean brisk or lively, suggesting a heaviness of traffic or transactions: a day of <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> trading.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Occupied</FONT></B> shares with <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>active</FONT></I> a simple contrast with idle. When used of a person, it suggests his involvement with a specific task: <I><FONT color=brown>occupied</FONT></I> with sweeping out the fireplace. When used of an object, it suggests it physical use at that moment. A telephone line can be <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I> but cannot be <I><FONT color=brown>occupied</FONT></I>. Conversely, a telephone booth can be <I><FONT color=brown>occupied</FONT></I> but cannot be busy. <I><FONT color=brown>Occupied</FONT></I>, when used of someone’s mental state, means absorbed in thought, either purposive or idle: <I><FONT color=brown>occupied</FONT></I> in adding the figures before him; She <I><FONT color=brown>occupies</FONT></I> herself with trifles. In either case, it can suggest concentration to the point of distraction: so <I><FONT color=brown>occupied</FONT></I> in thought that he did not see the speeding car. <B><FONT color=blue>Engrossed</FONT></B> compares closely with this special use of <I><FONT color=brown>occupied</FONT></I>, implying even greater concentration, but with the added suggestion of pleasurable, willing or fascinated involvement: <I><FONT color=brown>engrossed</FONT></I> in a good mystery story; <I><FONT color=brown>engrossed</FONT></I> in his work.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Engaged</FONT></B> suggests involvement, like <I><FONT color=brown>busy</FONT></I>, but implies concentration on a specific task, like <I><FONT color=brown>occupied</FONT></I>. It also has a special sense of coming to grips with a situation: The <I><FONT color=brown>engaged</FONT></I> artist struggles to state the dilemmas facing his society. It has a military use for units involved in a hostile encounter: The <I><FONT color=brown>engaged</FONT></I> patrol was cut off from its own front line. It also refers to a man and woman in the formalized period of courtship just before marriage: an <I><FONT color=brown>engaged</FONT></I> couple.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Activity">ACTIVITY</A>, <A href="entry://Diligent">DILIGENT</A>, <A href="entry://Fight">FIGHT</A>, <A href="entry://Hire">HIRE</A>, <A href="entry://Overt">OVERT</A>, <A href="entry://Preoccupied">PREOCCUPIED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: idle, inactive, inert, passive, relaxed, unoccupied.</P>

<P>These words refer to a group of people who have joined forces for some secret purpose which is looked upon as evil and often ahs to do with the displacement or discrediting of an established authority or government. <B><FONT color=blue>Conspiracy</FONT></B> is the most general term; it can apply to any combination of persons united for the accomplishment of an unlawful or reprehensible end: a <I><FONT color=brown>conspiracy</FONT></I> of gangsters who were forcing shopkeepers to pay protection under the threat of personal harm; a <I><FONT color=brown>conspiracy</FONT></I> of business-men who were trying to wrest control of a large company from its legal owners; the <I><FONT color=brown>conspiracy</FONT></I> which assassinated Caesar. <B><FONT color=blue>Cabal</FONT></B> suggests a small, well-organized group of highly placed people intent on a clearly defined goal; this usually involves an attempt to bring about a power change in some governmental structure or the overthrow someone in a position of great authority: a <I><FONT color=brown>cabal</FONT></I> of cabinet ministers seeking to over throw the president and turn the republic into a fascist state. <B><FONT color=blue>Junta</FONT></B> is the most specific of these words in that it almost always denotes a group of people united for political intrigue: a shaky régime that was ripe for seizure by a military <I><FONT color=brown>junta</FONT></I>. The word also may carry the implication of a temporary government during a crisis or of an emergency governing structure set up after a revolution: broadcasts by the <I><FONT color=brown>junta</FONT></I> promising free election once the dissidents had been purged.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Intrigue">INTRIGUE</A>.</P>

cabaret
<B><FONT color=blue>bar</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cabaret</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cocktail lounge</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>discothèque</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>nightclub</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>saloon</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to public places in which alcoholic drinks are served. <B><FONT color=blue>Bar</FONT></B> is the general word for that section of a licensed hotel, or a licensed club, in which the serving and drinking of liquor is the primary concern. [Let’s have a drink in the <I><FONT color=brown>bar</FONT></I> before we go into the dining room.] In America the word refers also to the ubiquitous street <I><FONT color=brown>bar</FONT></I> (often small) which is not part of a hotel but which exists solely for the serving and drinking of alcoholic beverages. <B><FONT color=blue>Saloon</FONT></B> has a much more complicated set of meanings. In Australia, as in Britain, the <I><FONT color=brown>saloon bar</FONT></I> in a hotel is separate from the public <I><FONT color=brown>bar</FONT></I> and differs from the latter in that its appointments are superior and the drinks more costly. (A similar distinction between these tow sorts of bars exists in New Zealand hotels, but in this case the better-appointed kind is known as the lounge <I><FONT color=brown>bar</FONT></I> or private <I><FONT color=brown>bar</FONT></I>.) Drawn from the French <I><FONT color=brown>salon</FONT></I>, the word <I><FONT color=brown>saloon</FONT></I> can also indicate the main gathering place of a passenger ship, reflecting its earliest use pertaining to the room in a home where people gathered for conversation. In any case, <I><FONT color=brown>saloon</FONT></I> originally suggested an elegantly appointed place, one both sumptuous and respectable. As such, it was taken over in America to confer respectability on public drinking places, but with the Prohibition era the word lost favour and came to indicate any sordid, low-life <I><FONT color=brown>bar</FONT></I>, a connotation from which the word, in America, has never recovered.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cocktail lounge</FONT></B> does indicate the elegant surroundings once suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>saloon</FONT></I>. Typically, such a place might be spacious and well-upholstered; it would offer a menu of food and possibly a singer or pianist for entertainment, though most likely it would not accommodate social dancing. The main function, here, is still that of serving liquor. <B><FONT color=blue>Nightclub</FONT></B> suggests a more lavish setting than <I><FONT color=brown>cocktail lounge</FONT></I>, indicating a place where eating and entertainment are as important as drinking itself. Whereas one could frequent a <I><FONT color=brown>cocktail lounge</FONT></I> in the afternoon or early evening, <I><FONT color=brown>nightclub</FONT></I> specifically indicates late hours; furthermore, the entertainment typically includes social dancing, a band (or "combo") of musicians, often with a singer, and the performances of one or more comedians. The entertainment may be on a far more lavish scale, involving an orchestra, chorus girls, etc.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cabaret</FONT></B> also indicates a place offering entertainment as well as liquor. It suggests smaller, more intimate surroundings, however, where singing or dancing acts are presented, though social dancing may not be involved. Recently, satirical revues and even serious plays have been presented in <I><FONT color=brown>cabarets</FONT></I>. At its inception, the recent word <B><FONT color=blue>discothèque</FONT></B> referred to a place where the new forms of social dancing were done to recorded music. Now the word is also used of places where modern social dancing is done to live music. <I><FONT color=brown>Discothèque</FONT></I> is the one word here that need not imply the serving of alcoholic drinks, since many of these places cater particularly to teenagers to whom alcohol may not be sold.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hotel">HOTEL</A>, <A href="entry://Restaurant">RESTAURANT</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>candid</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bluff</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>frank</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ingenuous</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the revealing or expressing of one’s true thoughts of feelings. <B><FONT color=blue>Candid</FONT></B> can refer generally to a forthright manner or statement, but the word has been heavily influenced by its related use to refer to impromptu or unposed photographs; a <I><FONT color=brown>candid</FONT></I> camera is one suitable for taking such pictures. Consequently, the word has acquired overtones pertaining to natural, informal and unrehearsed statements as well: he agreed to give his <I><FONT color=brown>candid</FONT></I> opinion if his name weren’t mentioned in the news story. <B><FONT color=blue>Frank</FONT></B> can also apply in a general way, but it is most often used to describe statements: a <I><FONT color=brown>frank</FONT></I> admission of guilt. In positive use, it can indicate an admirable openness and sincerity, but sometimes it can apply less favourably to someone who is unnecessarily blunt or flat-footed about things, despite other people’s feelings: her <I><FONT color=brown>frank</FONT></I> disapproval of the way they had furnished their living room.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bluff</FONT></B> sometimes stresses this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>frank</FONT></I>, indicating a direct manner or blunt statements that show no consciousness of or consideration for the vulnerabilities of other people: a <I><FONT color=brown>bluff</FONT></I> sergeant-major teasing the men who didn’t pass inspection. The word more often applies to men than women, and now usually means blunt in a good-natured way: a lovable, <I><FONT color=brown>bluff</FONT></I> old curmudgeon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ingenuous</FONT></B> can refer descriptively to a lack of guile, but more often it can also suggest a person who is simple or unaware to the point of gullibility: She gave <I><FONT color=brown>ingenuous</FONT></I> answers to all the stranger’s question.

<P>These verbs all mean to seize and to take captive. <B><FONT color=blue>Capture</FONT></B> is the strongest word. It implies the use of force or stratagem in overcoming active resistance: to <I><FONT color=brown>capture</FONT></I> an enemy fort; to <I><FONT color=brown>capture</FONT></I> an armed robber. <B><FONT color=blue>Catch</FONT></B> is the most general word. It suggests the seizure or detection of something fugitive or elusive ?often implying active pursuit, clever entrapment or a taking by surprise: to <I><FONT color=brown>catch</FONT></I> a runaway horse; to <I><FONT color=brown>catch</FONT></I> a thief.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Arrest</FONT></B> is applied only to persons in this sense and always carries the implication of a legal offence. It means to take into custody by legal authority and often involves detention in goal. Police <I><FONT color=brown>caught</FONT></I> him fleeing the scene of the crime and <I><FONT color=brown>arrested</FONT></I> him as a suspect. <B><FONT color=blue>Apprehend</FONT></B> is a more formal word for <I><FONT color=brown>arrest</FONT></I>, involving the seizure of someone in the name of the law: He was <I><FONT color=brown>apprehended</FONT></I> five hours after his escape. <I><FONT color=brown>Apprehend</FONT></I> is the sort of word used in official documents and reports; it seems stilted or pretentious in everyday contexts. <B><FONT color=blue>Nab</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pinch</FONT></B> are informal synonyms for <I><FONT color=brown>catch</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>arrest</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Pinch</FONT></I> is more general, while <I><FONT color=brown>nab</FONT></I> stresses the suddenness of the seizure, often implying a rough grabbing: Police <I><FONT color=brown>nabbed</FONT></I> him as he ran out of the raided nightclub.</P><P>In extended senses, <I><FONT color=brown>catch</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>capture</FONT></I> may mean to seize something fleeting, to grasp something hard to get hold of. <I><FONT color=brown>Capture</FONT></I> implies the greater difficulty and achievement : to <I><FONT color=brown>catch</FONT></I> a likeness in a sketch; an artist who <I><FONT color=brown>captures</FONT></I> a fleeting expression. Both words man also mean to captivate or enthral. [The song <I><FONT color=brown>caught</FONT></I> her fancy; The book <I><FONT color=brown>captured</FONT></I> his imagination.]</P><P>Four of these verbs are used of the seizure of animals in hunting. <I><FONT color=brown>Capture</FONT></I> is applied to wild animals brought back alive, as for exhibition in a zoo or training by an animal tamer: to <I><FONT color=brown>capture</FONT></I> lions and tigers. <I><FONT color=brown>Catch</FONT></I> is applied to small or harmless animals that are enticed by a bait or fooled by camouflage: to <I><FONT color=brown>catch</FONT></I> fish; to <I><FONT color=brown>catch</FONT></I> a mouse in a trap; to <I><FONT color=brown>catch</FONT></I> a bird in a snare. <B><FONT color=blue>Trap</FONT></B> focuses on the use of a trap, snare or pitfall to catch unsuspecting animals; to <I><FONT color=brown>trap</FONT></I> fur-bearing animals for their pelts. Persons may be <I><FONT color=brown>trapped</FONT></I> like animals by being caught in a cul-de-sac, cut off from all escape routes: <I><FONT color=brown>trapped</FONT></I> in a burning building; <I><FONT color=brown>trapped</FONT></I> in a dull job and a bad marriage. <B><FONT color=blue>Bag</FONT></B> is expressive of the hunter’s satisfaction at having his quarry literally in the bag: to <I><FONT color=brown>bag</FONT></I> a wild pig. In a figurative sense, bag stresses the triumph of the successful hunt, the bringing home of some sought-after prize: She <I><FONT color=brown>bagged</FONT></I> a minor poet for her salon.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Grasp">GRASP</A>, <A href="entry://Hunt">HUNT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: free, let go, liberate, release.</P>

<P>These words are all used to describe people in reference to the care they exercise in their general behaviour, in the performance of duties and in attention to detail. Careful is the most general word in the list. It can mean thorough or painstaking, and in this sense suggests the avoidance of error by virtue of the care exercised: a careful secretary who always checked her work twice. It can mean concerned or mindful: careful about his manners at the party. It can mean cautious or watchful: Be careful when you drive on mountain roads.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conscientious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scrupulous</FONT></B> agree in connoting a painstaking carefulness based on an ethical, logical, moral, or other standard. [A <I><FONT color=brown>conscientious</FONT></I> researcher, through a highly developed regard for the truth, is <I><FONT color=brown>careful</FONT></I> to avoid error or omission; A <I><FONT color=brown>scrupulous</FONT></I> juror, out of a dedication to justice, is <I><FONT color=brown>careful</FONT></I> to weigh all the evidence and excludes all personal feelings.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Meticulous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>punctilious</FONT></B> denote a very strict or even an excessive attention to details or standards. <I><FONT color=brown>Meticulous</FONT></I> suggests an almost finicky concern, often about trivial matters, based on a fear of making an error: A <I><FONT color=brown>meticulous</FONT></I> dresser is <I><FONT color=brown>careful</FONT></I> to avoid all violations of the cannons of fashion. <I><FONT color=brown>Punctilious</FONT></I> implies an exaggerated regard for the fine points of the rules and forms prescribed by law or custom, as in etiquette: a <I><FONT color=brown>punctilious</FONT></I> social climber who was so <I><FONT color=brown>careful</FONT></I> about doing everybody else’s "right thing" that he never developed any standards of his own.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cautious">CAUTIOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Heedless">HEEDLESS</A>, neglectful, negligent, remiss, sloppy.</P>

<P>These words refer to the pleasurable, desirous or affectionate holding or stroking of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Caress</FONT></B> indicates a brief, gentle or embracing motion expressive of love or desire: tenderly <I><FONT color=brown>caressing</FONT></I> her once more before boarding the train. <B><FONT color=blue>Fondle</FONT></B> may stress desire more than love, but carries the same connotation of gentleness as <I><FONT color=brown>caress</FONT></I>. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>caress</FONT></I> might be done with the arms and body, however, <I><FONT color=brown>fondle</FONT></I> might more typically be done solely with the hands and so suggest a greater possible distance than <I><FONT color=brown>caress</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>fondling</FONT></I> the nape of his neck with her open palm. <B><FONT color=blue>Cuddle</FONT></B> is more informal than the foregoing; it specifically suggests body-to-body contact, but not necessarily to imply desire at all so much as affectionate pleasure: sleeping kittens <I><FONT color=brown>cuddled</FONT></I> next to their watchful mother. <B><FONT color=blue>Hug</FONT></B> emphasizes one possibility in <I><FONT color=brown>caress</FONT></I>, specifically suggesting an armclasp expressive of affection or desire. Being much more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>caress</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fondle</FONT></I>, and even than <I><FONT color=brown>cuddle</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>hug</FONT></I> seems better suited to indicate earthier emotions, although it contrasts with all the foregoing by stressing intensity of feeling rather than gentleness: desperately <I><FONT color=brown>hugging</FONT></I> her injured child; turning to <I><FONT color=brown>hug</FONT></I> each other as soon as they were in a secluded part of the park. <B><FONT color=blue>Dandle</FONT></B> is perhaps the most specific of all these words, restricting itself most concretely to the bouncing or rocking of a child in one’s lap or on one’s knee: gently <I><FONT color=brown>dandling</FONT></I> the child as she sang a lively nursery rhyme.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pet</FONT></B>, in its oldest sense, is close to <I><FONT color=brown>fondle</FONT></I> in indicating the stroking of a body with one’s hand: <I><FONT color=brown>petting</FONT></I> the purring cat. In a more recent quasi-slang sense, the word relates to <I><FONT color=brown>caress</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fondle</FONT></I>, but more specifically suggests in tense sexual play between lovers that stops short of intercourse: teenagers who find that <I><FONT color=brown>petting</FONT></I> in the back seats of cares only intensifies their natural frustrations. <B><FONT color=blue>Neck</FONT></B> is a slang term that exclusively pertains to this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>pet</FONT></I>, but usually suggests kissing, and may imply greater restraint than <I><FONT color=brown>pet</FONT></I>: couples who sat in the back circle of the theatre and spent more time <I><FONT color=brown>necking</FONT></I> than watching the movie. <B><FONT color=blue>Smooch</FONT></B> is a slang term similar in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>neck</FONT></I>, but often suggesting slobbery comic awkwardness rather than having sexual overtones, even if the affection is usually mutual.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Emotion">EMOTION</A>, <A href="entry://Love">LOVE</A>, <A href="entry://Yearn">YEARN</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>caricature</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>burlesque</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mimicry</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>parody</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>send-up</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>take-off</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>travesty</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to an exaggerated rendering of the recognizable features of something in order to mock or poke fun at it. <B><FONT color=blue>Caricature</FONT></B>, most specifically, refers to a drawing or cartoon of someone in which salient features are distorted or overemphasized for comic effect. This may be done in good-humoured fun or in an attempt at character assassination: a room filled with <I><FONT color=brown>caricatures</FONT></I> of theatrical stars; a <I><FONT color=brown>caricature</FONT></I> that represented the distinguished statesman as a masked gangster. The word can be used more widely of any production that deliberately distorts the recognizable features of something for any purpose: a novel that presents us with stereotyped <I><FONT color=brown>caricatures</FONT></I> rather than living human beings. <B><FONT color=blue>Send-up</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>take-off</FONT></B> are the most informal and general of any of these words, alluding to any exaggerated imitation designed to hold up its original to ridicule: a skit that was a <I><FONT color=brown>send-up</FONT></I> on the absurdities of several popular TV programmes; a imaginary transcript of a press conference that was a biting <I><FONT color=brown>take-off</FONT></I> on the real thing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mimicry</FONT></B>, most specifically, suggests the exaggerated acting out of another person’s mannerisms and speech patterns; as with <I><FONT color=brown>caricature</FONT></I>, this may be done out of good humour or malice: his whining <I><FONT color=brown>mimicry</FONT></I> of the professor’s voice; a series of impersonations in which his keen sense for <I><FONT color=brown>mimicry</FONT></I> is expertly displayed. This word also is frequently used for a wider range of exaggerated imitations: his devastating <I><FONT color=brown>mimicry</FONT></I> of the worst features of Lawrence’s prose style. Sometimes the word can be used for inept imitation of an admired figure or style: his pitiful <I><FONT color=brown>mimicry</FONT></I> of upper-class manners.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Burlesque</FONT></B> suggests a rowdy or zany reduction to the absurd of the content or style of some production or work, especially where the original is afflicted with pomposity or excessive solemnity: a revue that was a <I><FONT color=brown>burlesque</FONT></I> of the typically woebegone naturalistic play. Sometimes, like <I><FONT color=brown>caricature</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>mimicry</FONT></I>, the word can indicate specifically the satirizing of the characteristics or mannerisms of a particular person: a figure in the novel that was clearly a <I><FONT color=brown>burlesque</FONT></I> of a well-known feminist of that day. <B><FONT color=blue>Parody</FONT></B> most specifically suggests the ridiculing of a literary work by an exaggerated imitation of its style: a howling <I><FONT color=brown>parody</FONT></I> of Longfellow’s "Evangeline"; a virtuoso <I><FONT color=brown>parody</FONT></I> of the author’s endlessly tortuous sentence structure. Where <I><FONT color=brown>burlesque</FONT></I> may imply broad, slashing strokes applied slapdash, <I><FONT color=brown>parody</FONT></I>, by contrast, more often suggests an extremely skilful and understated imitation that is all the more effective for so cleverly catching the style of its original. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>parodies</FONT></I> have been done so consummately as to be mistakenly admired as a serious effort; this could almost never happen with a <I><FONT color=brown>burlesque</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Travesty</FONT></B> was once and is still rarely used, like <I><FONT color=brown>burlesque</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>parody</FONT></I>, to suggest a broad or skilful mocking of someone else’s style. It is now more often used to suggest an utterly inept or totally depraved debasement of something admirable; a shocking <I><FONT color=brown>travesty</FONT></I> of impartial judicial procedures. Sometimes, in its most hyperbolical uses, the standard to which something is compared is not even indicated: The whole concert was simply a <I><FONT color=brown>travesty</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Imitate">IMITATE</A>, <A href="entry://Ridicule">RIDICULE</A>.</P>

<P>These words are alike in referring to the moving of objects or people through space. <B><FONT color=blue>Carry</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bear</FONT></B> both suggest the supporting of a load, but of the two only <I><FONT color=brown>carry</FONT></I> necessarily implies movement from place to place. A donkey can <I><FONT color=brown>bear</FONT></I> a heavy load simply by standing still, but <I><FONT color=brown>carrying</FONT></I> the load implies moving it somewhere: The bridge was designed to <I><FONT color=brown>bear</FONT></I> the heaviest load any train could <I><FONT color=brown>carry</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Bear</FONT></I>, of course, can suggest movement as well, in which case a dignity of comportment and style is suggested: the royal carriage <I><FONT color=brown>bearing</FONT></I> the queen and her consort. <I><FONT color=brown>Carry</FONT></I>, on the other hand, need not necessarily emphasize the heaviness of the thing being moved: <I><FONT color=brown>carrying</FONT></I> only a small handbag and a pair of gloves. <I><FONT color=brown>Bear</FONT></I> has an additional connotation of suffering not implied by <I><FONT color=brown>carry</FONT></I>: He <I><FONT color=brown>bore</FONT></I> with him all his life the memory of her painful death.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Transport</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>haul</FONT></B> are more formal and technical than these; <I><FONT color=brown>transport</FONT></I> is normally restricted to the shipment of goods or people considered as fright, while <I><FONT color=brown>haul</FONT></I> refers only to freight: ships to <I><FONT color=brown>transport</FONT></I> troops to the battlefield; semi-trailers to <I><FONT color=brown>haul</FONT></I> interstate freight. <I><FONT color=brown>Transport</FONT></I>, more than <I><FONT color=brown>carry</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>haul</FONT></I> emphasizes movement to a goal or destination. They contrast with the style implied in <I><FONT color=brown>bear</FONT></I> by stressing the mere physical event of shipment as a problem in logistics.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bring</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>take</FONT></B> are the most informal of all these; <I><FONT color=brown>bring</FONT></I> refers to movement towards the speaker, <I><FONT color=brown>take</FONT></I> to movement away from the speaker. Both are often used imperatively: <I><FONT color=brown>Take</FONT></I> away this ghastly veal cutlet and <I><FONT color=brown>bring</FONT></I> me my slippers. In actual usage, the to or from distinction is not always observed; both may also imply an accompanied or guided movement rather than one in which one thing <I><FONT color=brown>carries</FONT></I> another. [<I><FONT color=brown>Take</FONT></I> me to the nearest hospital; The ski life will <I><FONT color=brown>bring</FONT></I> you within a few feet of the mountaintop.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Convey</FONT></B> was in Shakespeare’s time a simple synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>bring</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>take</FONT></I>. In this sense it is now extremely formal and is mainly used in referring to the transmitting of a message through an intermediary. [<I><FONT color=brown>Convey</FONT></I> my best wishes to the rest of your family; The ambassador personally <I><FONT color=brown>conveyed</FONT></I> the president’s message to the premier.] <I><FONT color=brown>Convey</FONT></I> does not necessarily imply actual movement.

<P>These words refer to misfortunes that result in grave loss or heavy casualties. <B><FONT color=blue>Catastrophe</FONT></B> is equally appropriate for a personal or public misfortune: taking along a first-aid kit to cope with unexpected <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I>; air pollution that has reached the proportions of a <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I>. In personal application, the word is often used hyperbolically of minor incidents: how to deal with the <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I> of a large, visible run in her stocking. In reference to a general event, the word may refer to the negative effect on a particular group rather than to the public as a whole: a land reform programme that benefited the poor but was a <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I> for rich landowners. <B><FONT color=blue>Cataclysm</FONT></B> is most sharply in contrast with these possibilities of <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I> in allowing little use for personal misfortune and in restricting itself to severe mishaps that have negative results for everyone; it stresses, furthermore, a momentous disruption that results in severe damage and loss: a hairbreadth escape from nuclear <I><FONT color=brown>cataclysm</FONT></I>. More than these other words, <I><FONT color=brown>cataclysm</FONT></I> is especially suggestive of a natural upheaval: the extinct volcano’s eruption would mean a <I><FONT color=brown>cataclysm</FONT></I> for the city.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disaster</FONT></B> is the most general of these words, referring both to personal and public misfortunes in a wide range of possibilities: household <I><FONT color=brown>disasters</FONT></I>; a country afflicted with the twin <I><FONT color=brown>disasters</FONT></I> of food shortages and an exploding population. Like <I><FONT color=brown>cataclysm</FONT></I>, the word can refer to natural upheavals, but without the implications of total destruction present in <I><FONT color=brown>cataclysm</FONT></I>: a flood that was the worst <I><FONT color=brown>disaster</FONT></I> the city had ever faced. <I><FONT color=brown>Disaster</FONT></I> compares with <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I> by stressing the actual harm done: They were glad they had survived the <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I> and had met with no <I><FONT color=brown>disaster</FONT></I>. The word can, of course, be used hyperbolically, like <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I>, for minor misfortunes: a party that turned out to be a complete <I><FONT color=brown>disaster</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Calamity</FONT></B> is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>catastrophe</FONT></I>, but at a reduced level of intensity. It may also now sound more formal than these other words, or at least shade outdated. It is more often used for a personal misfortune, seriously or hyperbolically, but it can also be used of public misfortunes on occasion, in which case it functions more abstractly or subjectively than <I><FONT color=brown>disaster</FONT></I>: a little <I><FONT color=brown>calamity</FONT></I> that happened on his way to school; a <I><FONT color=brown>calamity</FONT></I> that wiped out his savings; arguing that the bill’s passage would result in a <I><FONT color=brown>calamity</FONT></I> for the whole country. <B><FONT color=blue>Debacle</FONT></B> once referred specifically to a serious disruption or natural upheaval, as of a flood, especially when severe damage or failure results: the <I><FONT color=brown>debacle</FONT></I> of the Children’s Crusade; a stock-market <I><FONT color=brown>debacle</FONT></I>. Now, the word more often refers to an attempt that is ridiculously inept or that results in humiliating defeat: a high-level conference that was nothing short of a <I><FONT color=brown>debacle</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, <A href="entry://Fire">FIRE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Benefit">BENEFIT</A>, blessing, boon, comfort, success.</P>

<P>These words refer to thoughtful restraint in behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Cautious</FONT></B> is the most general of these, suggesting a careful holding back from action until all possibilities have been considered: a <I><FONT color=brown>cautious</FONT></I> attitude towards buying into his company. The word can, as well, suggest careful action, in which case it suggests a slow, tentative or even timid manner: his <I><FONT color=brown>cautious</FONT></I> crossing of the rickety bridge. <B><FONT color=blue>Wary</FONT></B> is an intensification of all the implications of <I><FONT color=brown>cautious</FONT></I>, stressing an extremely hesitant manner that sees every course of action fairly bristling with dangers: giving a <I><FONT color=brown>wary</FONT></I> reply to the enigmatic comment of the stranger; asking the campers to be particularly <I><FONT color=brown>wary</FONT></I> of starting a bush-fire during the dry season.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Guarded</FONT></B> also intensifies the implication of <I><FONT color=brown>cautious</FONT></I>, but puts special stress on a wary manner in social interchanges that is marked by a reluctance to reveal too much about oneself or give too much of oneself except to people with whom one is thoroughly familiar: a <I><FONT color=brown>guarded</FONT></I>, non-committal answer to the interviewer’s blunt questions. It may also suggest a deliberate suppression of one’s feelings for fear of having them proved wrong: a <I><FONT color=brown>guarded</FONT></I> optimism about the outcome of the election. Whereas the former words point to restrained behaviour that might result from fear, unfamiliarity, or uneasiness, <B><FONT color=blue>prudent</FONT></B> suggests action that is the outcome of wisdom gained by experience. Such action need not be <I><FONT color=brown>cautious</FONT></I> or wary at all; these words might, in fact, suggest the opposite of <I><FONT color=brown>prudent</FONT></I> when no real cause for fear exists: It was not <I><FONT color=brown>prudent</FONT></I> to be so <I><FONT color=brown>cautious</FONT></I> in climbing the slope, because it put her in constant danger of losing her balance.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Circumspect</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>discreet</FONT></B> both refer primarily to social behaviour. <I><FONT color=brown>Circumspect</FONT></I> indicates a strict adherence to social proprieties. [A <I><FONT color=brown>prudent</FONT></I> politician must perforce lead a rigorously <I><FONT color=brown>circumspect</FONT></I> life; if he cannot, he had best be <I><FONT color=brown>cautious</FONT></I> as to which temptations he permits himself to surrender to.] <I><FONT color=brown>Discreet</FONT></I> refers to a different kind of social propriety than circumspect, indicating an ability to keep the confidences of other people and to be extremely <I><FONT color=brown>guarded</FONT></I> about entrusting personal details to others: wondering how <I><FONT color=brown>discreet</FONT></I> her friend could be about what he knew of her past life. In a less specific use, <I><FONT color=brown>discreet</FONT></I> approaches the meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>circumspect</FONT></I>, suggesting a <I><FONT color=brown>prudent</FONT></I> choice of inoffensive behaviour or an ability to handle difficult matters with tact and delicacy. In this same the word nevertheless contrasts with circumspect in suggesting a more intuitive, less rigid approach to social behaviour.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Afraid">AFRAID</A>, prudence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bold">BOLD</A>, <A href="entry://Brave">BRAVE</A>, confident, <A href="entry://Daring">DARING</A>, reckless.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>cave</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>burrow</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cavern</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>grotto</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>tunnel</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a hollow or opening in the earth, either natural or artificial. <B><FONT color=blue>Cave</FONT></B> is least specific and can be applied to any hollowed-out area in the earth, usually one that occurs in the side of a mountain, cliff or hill. The cliff dwellers found that natural caves gave them warmth and protection during the Ice Age. Bears, for similar reasons, hibernate in <I><FONT color=brown>caves</FONT></I> during the winter.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cavern</FONT></B>, when used in place of cave, tends to sound inflated in diction. It can be used accurately, however, to refer to a more extensive subterranean <I><FONT color=brown>cave</FONT></I> or set of <I><FONT color=brown>caves</FONT></I> indefinite in extent, especially when it suggests a natural chamber such as one formed in limestone by running water. In this case, the sense of an opening into the slanted face of a hill is not necessarily maintained. One or more mouths of the <I><FONT color=brown>cavern</FONT></I> may open on to relatively level ground: The tourists clutched the guide-rail and of light. <I><FONT color=brown>Cavern</FONT></I> may be also used metaphorically for any obscure recess: the dark <I><FONT color=brown>caverns</FONT></I> of his mind.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Grotto</FONT></B> is the most specific of these terms, though it can refer either to an artificial or natural hollow. When artificial, it is a cavelike, manmade structure built as a recreational retreat or shrine: The towns-people placed a Christmas tree within their quaintly decorated <I><FONT color=brown>grotto</FONT></I> and sang carols there throughout the holidays. When natural, a <I><FONT color=brown>grotto</FONT></I> is typically picturesque, often forming a recess in a <I><FONT color=brown>cavern</FONT></I>, one that may be filled with odd-shaped stalagmites and stalactites: Daylight has never touched the <I><FONT color=brown>cave</FONT></I> paintings in the <I><FONT color=brown>grotto</FONT></I> at Lascaux.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Burrow</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tunnel</FONT></B> are alike in suggesting an artificial opening in the earth and often implying a linear shape as contrasted with the roughly spherical hollow most typical of a <I><FONT color=brown>cave</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Burrow</FONT></I> refers to the hollow dug by some animal such as a rabbit: The <I><FONT color=brown>burrows</FONT></I> of rabbits can cause erosion of pasture land. <I><FONT color=brown>Tunnel</FONT></I> can refer to a hollow in the earth dug by an animal, but it is used more frequently to refer to one dug by man. If its purpose is to permit movement from one point to another, as in a subway system, a <I><FONT color=brown>tunnel</FONT></I> would be mainly horizontal over most of its course. If dug for purposes of mining, a <I><FONT color=brown>tunnel</FONT></I> would usually slant sharply downwards into the depths of the earth: The miners were trapped in the <I><FONT color=brown>tunnel</FONT></I> by a cave-in along the passage just behind them.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hole">HOLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to joyful gatherings of people. Celebration and party are both general, suggesting any coming together of a number of people to rejoice over some happy event. Celebrations and parties can be large or small, public or private, formal or informal; but celebration usually connotes a large gathering and party a more intimate group, often of persons who are close friends or at least acquainted: the candidate’s victory celebration that drew nearly a thousand people; He felt fortunate to be a guest at one of her small, select dinner parties. Ball implies an official or stately occasion, and suggests a scrupulously selected guest list and formal attire: the debutante’s coming-out ball; the Lord Mayor’s Ball.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Festival</FONT></B> suggests the celebration of a whole community either periodically at a significant time of the year or on some important occasion: the town’s annual harvest <I><FONT color=brown>festival</FONT></I>. It is frequently applied to a planned series of cultural events: Sydney’s yearly Waratah <I><FONT color=brown>Festival</FONT></I>; such lures for summer tourists as the Salzburg and Spoleto <I><FONT color=brown>festivals</FONT></I>. It is also used to describe annual religious ceremonies: the <I><FONT color=brown>festival</FONT></I> of Trinity Sunday. <B><FONT color=blue>Feast</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>festival</FONT></I>, has a religious connotation: the <I><FONT color=brown>feast</FONT></I> of Palm Sunday. But in wider applications, it suggests a single <I><FONT color=brown>celebration</FONT></I> at which a great deal of food is eaten: all the knights and ladies gathering for a sumptuous <I><FONT color=brown>feast</FONT></I>. Outside a religious or historical context, the word may sound out-mode now, except in metaphorical or hyperbolically uses: That dinner you gave was a real <I><FONT color=brown>feast</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Banquet</FONT></B>, in fact, has almost replaced feast in the sense of a formal or official dinner; it suggests the honouring of a special event or guest or the observing of an important occasion: After the wedding <I><FONT color=brown>banquet</FONT></I>, there will be a formal <I><FONT color=brown>ball</FONT></I>.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Festivity</FONT></I> is vaguer in reference than most of these related words. It now might sound like inflated diction when it replaces <I><FONT color=brown>festival</FONT></I> or, especially, <I><FONT color=brown>party</FONT></I>: promising to look in later on the <I><FONT color=brown>festivities</FONT></I>. It is still viable, however, in suggesting a mood of convivial merry-making: the air of <I><FONT color=brown>festivity</FONT></I> that even the smallest town takes on during Christmas.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Rite">RITE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a position equidistant from the extremities or periphery, or to the vital part of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Centre</FONT></B>, most concretely, indicates such a point within the circumference of a circle or a sphere: the <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I> of the earth. It can, of course, suggest an approximate location of this sort within any configuration: at the <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I> of the intersection. Used metaphorically, it suggests a place of extreme density or importance: a metropolitan <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I>; at the very <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I> of his philosophy. <B><FONT color=blue>Middle</FONT></B>, most typically, indicates a point equidistant from the two ends of something: folding the paper down the <I><FONT color=brown>middle</FONT></I>. It can be used more loosely, as an informal substitute for centre, especially when an approximation is intended: right in the <I><FONT color=brown>middle</FONT></I> of the ocean. It is better used for a moment of time than <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I>: in the <I><FONT color=brown>middle</FONT></I> of the day. It can also indicate a point or moment that occurs in the thick of things: in the <I><FONT color=brown>middle</FONT></I> of our other troubles. Here, it suggests passivity as compared with <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I>: the man who was at the centre of the controversy. <I><FONT color=brown>Midst</FONT></I> is now mostly used in this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>middle</FONT></I> but without the implication of passivity; even here it might sound excessively formal except in some standard expressions: in the <I><FONT color=brown>midst</FONT></I> of battle; in the <I><FONT color=brown>midst</FONT></I> of life.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Core</FONT></B> specifically suggests the centre of a solid figure: an apple <I><FONT color=brown>core</FONT></I>; the hollow <I><FONT color=brown>core</FONT></I> of the building. Metaphorically, it has a wide range of uses suggesting the irreducible minimum or quintessence of something that may in its fullness be extensive and manifold: The <I><FONT color=brown>core</FONT></I> of our appeal is freedom of speech; the <I><FONT color=brown>core</FONT></I> of his argument. <B><FONT color=blue>Heart</FONT></B>, at its most concrete, contrasts with all these other words in referring to a vital organ rather than to an exact or approximate <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I>. In metaphorical uses, however, it may refer to the vital <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I> of something: the very <I><FONT color=brown>heart</FONT></I> of the city. It may also, like middle, refer approximately to the point of greatest density: in the <I><FONT color=brown>heart</FONT></I> of the jungle. In more abstract uses, it relates most closely to <I><FONT color=brown>core</FONT></I> in suggesting the sine qua non of something, although in this case the irreducible <I><FONT color=brown>core</FONT></I> is also seen as animating principle. [Magna Carta, signed by King John in 1215 under pressure from his barons, is the <I><FONT color=brown>heart</FONT></I> of British freedom and justice.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hub</FONT></B>, most concretely, refers to the <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I> of a wheel; in metaphorical uses, it may refer to the psychological <I><FONT color=brown>centre</FONT></I> of a city, even one laid out on a grid system: the <I><FONT color=brown>hub</FONT></I> of business activity in Melbourne. The word seems more exactly used when a network with radiating arms is suggested: the <I><FONT color=brown>hub</FONT></I> of the cocktail party around whom the lesser known spread out in diminishing rank.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Kernel">KERNEL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boundary">BOUNDARY</A>, <A href="entry://Edge">EDGE</A>, <A href="entry://Perimeter">PERIMETER</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to the process of making something over or making it different. <B><FONT color=blue>Change</FONT></B>, the most general and least formal, can mean any process of differentiation, slight or great, in appearance or essence, in quality or quantity: <I><FONT color=brown>changing</FONT></I> the desert into farmland; <I><FONT color=brown>changing</FONT></I> his mind; <I><FONT color=brown>changing</FONT></I> the way she wore her hair.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Alter</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>convert</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>modify</FONT></B> suggest relatively slight revisions of something, generally in appearance or use. Each also has a use with somewhat different effect for a change in attitude or belief. As listed, these words move from the slightly to the highly formal, with perhaps a similar progression in implication, from lesser to greater change. <I><FONT color=brown>Alter</FONT></I>, most commonly, refers to <I><FONT color=brown>changing</FONT></I> the fit of clothes, either making them looser or tighter by letting out or taking in seams: the dressmaker who <I><FONT color=brown>altered</FONT></I> the hemline of the skirt. It also commonly refers to the redecoration of buildings: workmen <I><FONT color=brown>altering</FONT></I> the bookshop into a self-service grocery. In both these uses, <I><FONT color=brown>alter</FONT></I> implies that the basic structure is worked with and around rather than <I><FONT color=brown>changed</FONT></I> in itself, although no value judgement is present concerning the result. <I><FONT color=brown>Alter</FONT></I>, more than any of these words except <I><FONT color=brown>change</FONT></I>, has a wide range of application. [He <I><FONT color=brown>altered</FONT></I> his stand on birth control; She <I><FONT color=brown>altered</FONT></I> the mistake on the price tag.] <I><FONT color=brown>Covert</FONT></I> suggests the adaptation of an object by a specially designed addition that will increase its usefulness: an attachment that <I><FONT color=brown>converts</FONT></I> your vacuum cleaner into a paint sprayer. When used of attitudes or beliefs, <I><FONT color=brown>convert</FONT></I> suggests a far more drastic change than alter: the man who was <I><FONT color=brown>converted</FONT></I> to Buddhism. <I><FONT color=brown>Modify</FONT></I>, when used of objects, suggests more basic changes than <I><FONT color=brown>alter</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>convert</FONT></I>, in which function more importantly than appearance is <I><FONT color=brown>changed</FONT></I>: car aerials <I><FONT color=brown>modified</FONT></I> by teenagers into lethal weapons. When applied to attitudes, however, <I><FONT color=brown>modify</FONT></I> implies less change than either <I><FONT color=brown>alter</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>convert</FONT></I>. It often has a special overtone of making less extreme. [He didn’t <I><FONT color=brown>alter</FONT></I> his position so much as <I><FONT color=brown>modify</FONT></I> its severity; in any case, you could hardly say he was <I><FONT color=brown>converted</FONT></I> by the arguments of the opposition.]</P><P>The remaining words suggest more drastic changes than the preceding, changes so profound that an entirely new entity may appear to have taken the place of the old. <B><FONT color=blue>Transmute</FONT></B> emphasizes an elemental change in the inner structure of a material, often implying a move from a lower to a higher state: coal <I><FONT color=brown>transmuted</FONT></I> to diamonds by aeons of intense pressure; alchemists vainly trying to <I><FONT color=brown>transmute</FONT></I> lead into gold. Change of this magnitude, obviously, is not accomplished by revision, as in <I><FONT color=brown>alter</FONT></I>, or by addition, as in <I><FONT color=brown>convert</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Transform</FONT></B> suggests change equally as profound, but, in concentrating on outward form or appearance, it is perhaps slightly less intense than <I><FONT color=brown>transmute</FONT></I> and certainly more general. <I><FONT color=brown>Transform</FONT></I> may suggest change in a person or a definite entity, <I><FONT color=brown>transmute</FONT></I> in a less well-defined quantity; <I><FONT color=brown>transmute</FONT></I> also tends to suggest a slow, analysable or scientific process, <I><FONT color=brown>transform</FONT></I> a sudden or mystical change: the frog that was <I><FONT color=brown>transformed</FONT></I> into a prince; plans that were <I><FONT color=brown>transformed</FONT></I> overnight into reality. <I><FONT color=brown>Transform</FONT></I> also lends itself to hyperbole, perhaps overused: lighted candles that <I><FONT color=brown>transformed</FONT></I> the oak table into elegant dining table.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Transfigure</FONT></B> intensifies the mystical element in <I><FONT color=brown>transform</FONT></I>, adding a note of supernatural or religious rapture: the statue of St. Teresa <I><FONT color=brown>transfigure</FONT></I> by ecstasy. When used hyperbolically of more common circumstances, a positive or joyful change is indicated: her plain features <I><FONT color=brown>transfigured</FONT></I> with tenderness. <B><FONT color=blue>Transmogrify</FONT></B>, on the other hand, always stresses negative change, bizarre or ugly: the peasant lad <I><FONT color=brown>transmogrified</FONT></I> into a dragon. In more usual circumstances, the effect is comic: the graceful child <I><FONT color=brown>transmogrified</FONT></I> into a gangling adolescent.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Addition">ADDITION</A>, <A href="entry://Build">BUILD</A>, <A href="entry://Devise">DEVISE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: maintain, stabilize, sustain.</P>

<P>These words all refer to an aspect that is an identifiable part of a person, place, mood or object. <B><FONT color=blue>Characteristic</FONT></B> may imply neutral description in referring to any aspect of something, without evaluating its relative importance to the whole: a psychological report that lists every possible <I><FONT color=brown>characteristic</FONT></I> of the person being studied. More often, however, the word suggests an aspect of the whole that is regarded as typical: a town that had all the <I><FONT color=brown>characteristics</FONT></I> of a typical seaside resort; the preponderance of <I><FONT color=brown>characteristic</FONT></I> that supported the diagnosis of alcoholism. The word has many scientific or technical uses in this sense, but may be overused in other contexts where a less formal word is available.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Attribute</FONT></B> may escape the charge of inflated diction or imprecise jargon when used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>characteristic</FONT></I> for non-technical situations. It also may be used to refer to something typical, but, while being positive rather than negative, it leans perhaps to greater neutrality in suggesting one of many possible aspects that make up a whole: eagerness to learn, an often overlooked <I><FONT color=brown>attribute</FONT></I> in small children. <B><FONT color=blue>Peculiarity</FONT></B>, on the other hand, is far from neutral in suggesting an unpleasant <I><FONT color=brown>attribute</FONT></I> that is quite noticeable: a <I><FONT color=brown>peculiarity</FONT></I> in his shuffling walk; a <I><FONT color=brown>peculiarity</FONT></I> of mind that insisted on an exact order in doing even the smallest task; a <I><FONT color=brown>peculiarity</FONT></I> of the northern climate.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Feature</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mark</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>peculiarity</FONT></I>, refer to something quite noticeable, but feature more readily suggests something positive, while <I><FONT color=brown>mark</FONT></I> may suggest wither positive or negative aspects. <I><FONT color=brown>Feature</FONT></I> most specifically refers to physical appearance: an aquiline nose that was her beat <I><FONT color=brown>feature</FONT></I>. In more general uses, it may refer to an unusual or outstanding aspect of something: the siesta that is a distinguishing <I><FONT color=brown>feature</FONT></I> of life in Mexico. In the entertainment or advertising worlds, the word is used to refer to a special or added attraction: the <I><FONT color=brown>feature</FONT></I> of the evening’s entertainment; the new model’s compactness as an added <I><FONT color=brown>feature</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Mark</FONT></I> is stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>feature</FONT></I> in suggesting something that sets its possessor apart: generosity as the <I><FONT color=brown>mark</FONT></I> of a civilized man. But it has negative uses that compare with <I><FONT color=brown>peculiarity</FONT></I>: the sadism that is the disfiguring <I><FONT color=brown>mark</FONT></I> of all fascist régimes. In the use, mark differs from <I><FONT color=brown>peculiarity</FONT></I> in suggesting an intrinsic rather than accidental or external departure from the norm.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Trait</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>quality</FONT></B> refer to more abstract attributes than <I><FONT color=brown>peculiarity</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>feature</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>mark</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Trait</FONT></I>, most specifically, is used to describe abiding behaviour patterns, rather than single or momentary actions: a <I><FONT color=brown>trait</FONT></I> of suspiciousness that underlay all his relationships with people; <I><FONT color=brown>traits</FONT></I> of fortitude and industry that spelled survival for the settlers of a new colony. <I><FONT color=brown>Quality</FONT></I> is more general than any of the other words here; it may suggest a momentary aspect or an abiding one; it may suggest positive or negative <I><FONT color=brown>attributes</FONT></I>. It may imply measurable, concrete aspects, but is often used, contrarily, to suggest a vague or subtle gathering of impressions: a <I><FONT color=brown>quality</FONT></I> of despair in her drawn face; a strange <I><FONT color=brown>quality</FONT></I> of light in the room; <I><FONT color=brown>qualities</FONT></I> of exuberance and spontaneity that made the people easy to live with.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Temperament">TEMPERAMENT</A>.</P>

<P>All these words are superlatives used mainly to describe the pleasing manner of an attractive person, usually a woman. <B><FONT color=blue>Charming</FONT></B> emphasizes gracious behaviour or elegance of manner, especially in social situations: Her <I><FONT color=brown>charming</FONT></I> considerateness made everyone feel at ease. It applies readily to feminine accomplishments or apparel: a <I><FONT color=brown>charming</FONT></I> table setting; a <I><FONT color=brown>charming</FONT></I> gown. Used of men, it suggests sophistication and suavity: the <I><FONT color=brown>charming</FONT></I> man with the slight French accent. Originally it suggested being put under a magic charm; the force of this original meaning is still felt, perhaps, when the word refers to a beautiful scene or landscape: the <I><FONT color=brown>charming</FONT></I> mountain views we glimpsed through the windows of our train.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bewitching</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>enchanting</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>entrancing</FONT></B> also once suggested being put under a magic spell. Now, used to describe an attractive woman, they do not suggest social grace so much as qualities of freshness, strangeness or exotic allure, all considerably less innocuous than anything implied by <I><FONT color=brown>charming</FONT></I>. One might call the girl next door <I><FONT color=brown>charming</FONT></I>, for all her simplicity, but one would think twice about calling her <I><FONT color=brown>bewitching</FONT></I> ?unless one lived in a rather unusual neighbourhood. <I><FONT color=brown>Bewitching</FONT></I> most strongly suggests this exotic quality; <I><FONT color=brown>enchanting</FONT></I>, through overuse, is more innocuous than its two companions ?shading off towards <I><FONT color=brown>charming</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Entrancing</FONT></I> still has some of its freshness left, suggesting an ability to command an onlooker’s stunned, almost hypnotized, attention: stupidly staring back at every <I><FONT color=brown>entrancing</FONT></I> smile she gave him. The same scale of forces for these three prevails when they are used to describe scenery. None of them would be a likely description for a man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Captivating</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>winning</FONT></B> suggest a different and fainter submerged metaphor ?of military conquest. They might both be most precisely used to imply an initial resistance on the part of the onlooker. <I><FONT color=brown>Winning</FONT></I>, however, suggests warm-hearted sunniness of disposition, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>captivating</FONT></I> carries an overtone of sexual allure and vivacity. <I><FONT color=brown>Winning</FONT></I>, also, might pertain to a single act, while <I><FONT color=brown>captivating</FONT></I> might apply more easily to a whole manner of behaviour: her <I><FONT color=brown>winning</FONT></I> appeal to him for help; his fading resistance to the <I><FONT color=brown>captivating</FONT></I> figure she made, standing alone and silent on the moonlit piazza.

chaste
<B><FONT color=blue>chaste</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>continent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pure</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>virtuous</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the abstinence from immoral thoughts and actions, especially those of a sexual nature. <B><FONT color=blue>Chaste</FONT></B> is most often taken to mean abstinence from sexual activity of any sort: men who consort with promiscuous women but insist on marrying one who has been <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I>. The word has a wider range of use, however: <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I> in thought, word and deed. It can also refer to a married person who refrains from committing adultery: a <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I> wife; Her husband had remained <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I> largely through lack of opportunity. While humorous, the last example indicates that <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I> can be taken as indicating mere lack of activity. Generally speaking, where action is concerned, self-restraint or self-denial is, in fact, usually implied as necessary in maintaining <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I> behaviour. But <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I> thoughts would be those completely and naturally free of sensual or sexual desire. <I><FONT color=brown>Chaste</FONT></I> can also refer to whatever is self-restrained, free of frivolity, and spare or severe in effect: a chaste prose style that was striking in its simplicity and clarity.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pure</FONT></B> emphasizes what has never been adulterated by immoral or sexual strivings. In this it is like chaste as it applies to thought, but here, <I><FONT color=brown>pure</FONT></I> can apply to the whole range of possibilities with this emphasis: the <I><FONT color=brown>pure</FONT></I> in spirit; He insisted that even the <I><FONT color=brown>purest</FONT></I> infant had already been tainted with original sin. <B><FONT color=blue>Virtuous</FONT></B> is much milder in its force than either <I><FONT color=brown>pure</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I>, pointing to someone who refrains from immoral actions. With this word, the stress is less exclusively on sexual behaviour, indicating a generally moral or decent behaviour: the <I><FONT color=brown>virtuous</FONT></I> citizens of his hometown; those who are blessed with a <I><FONT color=brown>virtuous</FONT></I> husband or wife.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Continent</FONT></B> refers strictly to refraining from acting upon desires or needs. Where sexuality is concerned, a person might not be <I><FONT color=brown>pure</FONT></I> in feeling or <I><FONT color=brown>chaste</FONT></I> in his imaginings and yet be <I><FONT color=brown>continent</FONT></I> if he successfully resists actual physical activity: She insisted that they remain <I><FONT color=brown>continent</FONT></I> until they were engaged to be married. In addition to sexuality, resistance to other appetites may be indicated by the word; here moderation rather than abstinence may be the point of its use: the alcoholic who found it impossible to be <I><FONT color=brown>continent</FONT></I> at a cocktail party; ex-servicemen’s re-unions at which few remain <I><FONT color=brown>continent</FONT></I>. The aspect of control is especially evident in a related use, pertaining to the ability to retain bodily discharges: devices to help bed-wetters become <I><FONT color=brown>continent</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Innocent">INNOCENT</A>, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, immoral, impure, <A href="entry://Indecent">INDECENT</A>, <A href="entry://Lewd">LEWD</A>, tainted.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>chatter</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>babble</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gibber</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>jabber</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>prate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>prattle</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>yak</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all refer to confused, rapid, incoherent or worthless talk. <B><FONT color=blue>Chatter</FONT></B> is the most general of these; it may refer to quick rambling talk that is light, idle or inconsequential, or it may refer to a din of voices all speaking at once: the man who pretended to listen silently as his wife <I><FONT color=brown>chattered</FONT></I> on and on; the women <I><FONT color=brown>chattering</FONT></I> in the backyard like a flock of magpies. The word is perhaps most appropriate to describe women’s or children’s voices, since a high-pitched quality of speech is usually implied. <B><FONT color=blue>Babble</FONT></B> suggests the almost idiotically meandering talk of a person or group of persons, without reference to sex: the drunkard who <I><FONT color=brown>babbled</FONT></I> out his life history to everyone in the crowded bar; the spectators in the gallery whose combined voices <I><FONT color=brown>babbled</FONT></I> in one continuous uproar.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Jabber</FONT></B> is a jocose, slangy way of referring to rapid interchanges of a conversation one doesn’t understand or considers trivial: two merchants <I><FONT color=brown>jabbering</FONT></I> away in their bargaining for the cheer delight of hearing their own voices. The suggestion is even stronger in this word of a frenetic pace without respite. <B><FONT color=blue>Gibber</FONT></B>, however, is more strongly pejorative than <I><FONT color=brown>jabber</FONT></I> when applied to people. It suggests that the sounds produced are literally meaningless: a <I><FONT color=brown>gibbering</FONT></I> idiot; dancer who <I><FONT color=brown>gibbered</FONT></I> in grunts and groans that kept time with the music. The word may be purely descriptive when applied to animals: monkeys <I><FONT color=brown>gibbering</FONT></I> back and forth in the branches overhead. <B><FONT color=blue>Prattle</FONT></B> shares with <I><FONT color=brown>jabber</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>gibber</FONT></I> suggestions of unintelligible sounds, but if confined to children or sound in nature, the result is not pejorative: a baby <I><FONT color=brown>prattling</FONT></I> contentedly in his cot; a lazy waterfall that <I><FONT color=brown>prattled</FONT></I> to itself all day. If used of adult speech, of course, the word suggests stupidity or childishness: the old man who <I><FONT color=brown>prattled</FONT></I> to himself on the park bench.</P><P>In <B><FONT color=blue>prate</FONT></B>, the suggestion of frenetically paced group speech present in <I><FONT color=brown>chatter</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>babble</FONT></I> is absent, as well as the unintelligibility present in those words grouped with <I><FONT color=brown>babble</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Prate</FONT></I>, on the contrary, most readily suggests a tedious, long-winded monologue full of the speaker’s self-importance: a teacher who <I><FONT color=brown>prates</FONT></I> on disconnectedly but relentlessly about everything that comes into his head. <B><FONT color=blue>Yak</FONT></B> is a slang word for conversation that is neither necessarily hectic nor unintelligible; it suggests, instead, a contented, relaxed flow of talk that is idle or trivial: His favourite pastime at university was <I><FONT color=brown>yakking</FONT></I> with friends till all hours of the night. The word can also carry a pejorative implication, in which case constant, frenetic and noisy talk may be indicated: He was nearly driven mad by the way his wife <I><FONT color=brown>yakked</FONT></I> at him without pause.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conversation">CONVERSATION</A>, <A href="entry://Cry">CRY</A>, <A href="entry://Laugh">LAUGH</A>, raillery, <A href="entry://Say">SAY</A>, <A href="entry://Talkative">TALKATIVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to deliberate attempts to gain something from another by unfair or dishonest scheming or dissembling. <B><FONT color=blue>Cheat</FONT></B> is relatively informal and <B><FONT color=blue>victimize</FONT></B> relatively formal, but both are general in their application, indicating any situation where one person preys upon someone else. <I><FONT color=brown>Cheat</FONT></I>, in its transitive use, always implies a victim, although the act indicated may range from the mildly unfair to the outrageously unjust or heinous: The boy <I><FONT color=brown>cheated</FONT></I> his friend out of the apple by insisting that it was rotten, if not poisonous; a real-estate agent who <I><FONT color=brown>cheated</FONT></I> the widow out of the land on which oil had been discovered. As can be seen, <I><FONT color=brown>cheat</FONT></I> usually implies deception or breaking of generally accepted rules; <I><FONT color=brown>victimize</FONT></I> does not specify the means used to prey on the other person. The word can, in fact, apply to situations where nothing is to be gained but sadistic pleasure: a bully who <I><FONT color=brown>victimized</FONT></I> the other children after school. The word does stress the harm done to the victim and is consequently the harshest word here in its disapproval, whether or not tangible gain is implied: gangsters who <I><FONT color=brown>victimized</FONT></I> a whole city with their ten-year reign of terror.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Swindle</FONT></B> more specifically points to a scheme, often complicated, by which someone is <I><FONT color=brown>cheated</FONT></I>: a famous stock-market racket that <I><FONT color=brown>swindled</FONT></I> investors by means of forged shared certificates. Often, the word point to the <I><FONT color=brown>cheating</FONT></I> of gullible people who are persuaded to part with their valuables by trickery or deception or by appeals to their cupidity: confidence men who <I><FONT color=brown>swindle</FONT></I> unsuspecting investors with get-rich-quick propositions. <B><FONT color=blue>Defraud</FONT></B> suggest the use of less complex stratagems to divest someone of his valuables; the word can more often suggest a quick or one-time action accomplished through simple misrepresentation or lying: door-to-door salesmen who <I><FONT color=brown>defraud</FONT></I> housewives by taking orders for vacuum cleaners that they never intend to deliver.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fleece</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>con</FONT></B> are both extremely informal words for <I><FONT color=brown>cheat</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>swindle</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Fleece</FONT></I> suggests the same kind of complicated scheme as is indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>swindle</FONT></I>; by implication, the victim here is seen to be naïve and innocent as a lamb: an avid art collector who was <I><FONT color=brown>fleeced</FONT></I> of a million dollars by a ring that sold counterfeit paintings attributed to Impressionist masters. The word can be reduced in force to apply to any outrageous price obtained for cheap goods or services: tourist attractions set up to <I><FONT color=brown>fleece</FONT></I> the unwary sightseer. <I><FONT color=brown>Con</FONT></I> is a slang term that derives from confidence game, in which someone is swindled by gaining his trust. The word applies to situations in which the victimizer has a smooth line and a sympathetic manner that wins the confidence of his victim: a man who would <I><FONT color=brown>con</FONT></I> his own mother out of her last dollar. The word has become a fad word for any sort of insincerity that is put on to persuade or win the sympathy of someone else, even where no ostensible gain is in the offing: a drunkard who tried to <I><FONT color=brown>con</FONT></I> all his friends into pitying the hard luck he had met with in his life.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deception">DECEPTION</A>, <A href="entry://Misleading">MISLEADING</A>, <A href="entry://Rob">ROB</A>, <A href="entry://Thief">THIEF</A>, <A href="entry://Trick">TRICK</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the raising of someone’s morale or to the creating of a positive or lively frame of mind. <B><FONT color=blue>Cheer</FONT></B> suggests, most concretely, that some occurrence has given a boost to an otherwise despondent outlook: We were <I><FONT color=brown>cheered</FONT></I> that the sun had finally come out and would at least dry our damp, clammy clothing; <I><FONT color=brown>cheered</FONT></I> by news that one helicopter had sighted a feeble fire farther up the mountain slope. <B><FONT color=blue>Encourage</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>cheer</FONT></I>, may refer to a raising of morale; as such it implies a resulting frame of mind that is less hopeful than with <I><FONT color=brown>cheer</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>encouraged</FONT></I> to look back on the considerable distance they had come, but still uneasy about the distance they had yet to cross. In another context, <I><FONT color=brown>encourage</FONT></I> may suggest the awakening of interest in someone else through sympathetic concern: He had been <I><FONT color=brown>encouraged</FONT></I> by his teacher to take his writing seriously.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gladden</FONT></B> may suggest the same situation as <I><FONT color=brown>cheer</FONT></I>, but like <I><FONT color=brown>encourage</FONT></I> it can function in its own context, without reference to the raising of a flagging morale: <I><FONT color=brown>gladdened</FONT></I> by their success at building a fire big enough to be seen a good distance off; <I><FONT color=brown>gladdened</FONT></I> by the news that he had become the grandfather of twins. <I><FONT color=brown>Gladden</FONT></I> can sometimes, however, sound faintly outdated or a shade too formal when compared with <I><FONT color=brown>cheer</FONT></I> and especially with <I><FONT color=brown>encourage</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Warm</FONT></B> may refer to a revival of morale or to a simple intensity of emotion, deeper than that implied by cheer or <I><FONT color=brown>gladden</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>warmed</FONT></I> by the ease with which they had cleaned up what had seemed the hopeless mess before them; <I><FONT color=brown>warmed</FONT></I> to know that her savings would go towards seeing her nephew through university.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Exhilarate</FONT></B> is unique among these words in suggesting a situation in which one is filled with a bracing exuberance and zest: He felt listless until the sea breeze <I><FONT color=brown>exhilarated</FONT></I> him and steadied his nerves.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Joyous">JOYOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>, merriment.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: chill, depress, <A href="entry://Discourage">DISCOURAGE</A>, dispirit, <A href="entry://Ridicule">RIDICULE</A>, sadden.</P>

<P>These words refer to positive frames of mind or to a brightly optimistic disposition. <B><FONT color=blue>Cheerful</FONT></B> suggests an extroverted and open manner that is warm, pleasant and contented: She smiled back at the <I><FONT color=brown>cheerful</FONT></I> faces of her students; the <I><FONT color=brown>cheerful</FONT></I> holidaymakers at the seaside. <B><FONT color=blue>Cheery</FONT></B>, by contrast, can suggest a <I><FONT color=brown>cheerful</FONT></I> manner that is forced or intrusive in its attempts to make others feel better. The <I><FONT color=brown>cheery</FONT></I> nurse in the hospital who proved to be such a grating nuisance. The word can sometimes be less unpleasant in tone: giving me a <I><FONT color=brown>cheery</FONT></I> wink as I passed by.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Happy</FONT></B> suggests an inward state of contentment that does not necessarily show itself in any outward bustle such as <I><FONT color=brown>cheerful</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>cheery</FONT></I> may indicate: so <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I> at the news that tears gathered in her eyes and ran down her cheeks. <B><FONT color=blue>Sunny</FONT></B> refers particularly to an untroubled disposition that is warm and friendly: a <I><FONT color=brown>sunny</FONT></I> laughter that rang out from the kitchen; the <I><FONT color=brown>sunny</FONT></I> expressions of children at a circus.</P><P>Bot <B><FONT color=blue>blithe</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>winsome</FONT></B> suggest a light lack of seriousness in manner. <I><FONT color=brown>Blithe</FONT></I> particularly indicates an almost reckless insouciance or indomitable light-headedness: a <I><FONT color=brown>blithe</FONT></I> way of stuffing unpaid bills in a drawer, as though that would take care of them; a bl<I><FONT color=brown>i</FONT></I>the willingness to try anything on impulse. <I><FONT color=brown>Winsome</FONT></I> contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>blithe</FONT></I> by suggesting an almost staid sweetness or delicacy of manner, warm but subdued; it is most often applied to women: a <I><FONT color=brown>winsome</FONT></I> smile that in the next minute turned into an embarrassed blush.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Blithe">BLITHE</A>, <A href="entry://Joyous">JOYOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>, <A href="entry://Optimistic">OPTIMISTIC</A>.</P><P>ANTOMYMS: downcast, <A href="entry://Gloomy">GLOOMY</A>, <A href="entry://Miserable">MISERABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Sad">SAD</A>, woebegone.</P>

<P>These words refer to appearances or prospects that are cold, unfriendly or unpromising. <B><FONT color=blue>Dismal</FONT></B> suggests woebegone low spirits: the <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I> sobbing of hungry children. Or it may suggest a course of action that portends utterly unfavourable consequences: a chance for survival that was at beast <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I>. It can also suggest extremely uncomfortable or unpleasant surroundings: a room so squalidly <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I> as to make her faintly sick to her stomach. <B><FONT color=blue>Grim</FONT></B> can be used in the same way as <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I>. Once it might have added a note of horror to each of the situations discussed above, but it has been used hyperbolically so often that it may have lost much of its force. Its full seriousness can sometimes be recaptured: the <I><FONT color=brown>grim</FONT></I> efficiency of the firing squad; the <I><FONT color=brown>grim</FONT></I> leer of the psychopath. In more informal uses it has less force than <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>grim</FONT></I> look the wife gave her husband; an exam that was really <I><FONT color=brown>grim</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Depressing</FONT></B>, which refers to a lowering of the spirits, has also been over-used ?so much so that it can apply very inexactly to any unwelcome situation: a <I><FONT color=brown>depressing</FONT></I> incident on my way to work: <I><FONT color=brown>depressing</FONT></I> weather; a <I><FONT color=brown>depressing</FONT></I> motion picture; her <I><FONT color=brown>depressing</FONT></I> gaiety. A more exact choice of word is often possible.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cheerless</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dour</FONT></B> are milder than <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I> but still refer to unpleasant appearances. <I><FONT color=brown>Cheerless</FONT></I> most readily suggests a prospect that promises to be drab and unrelieved: a <I><FONT color=brown>cheerless</FONT></I> room that could be brightened considerably with a little effort. <I><FONT color=brown>Dour</FONT></I> most appropriately suggests ill-humour: a <I><FONT color=brown>dour</FONT></I> glance that fully expressed her long-suffering pessimism. In describing a person, <I><FONT color=brown>cheerless</FONT></I> might suggest someone over-solemn: unable to tolerate the <I><FONT color=brown>cheerless</FONT></I> way she lived her life. <I><FONT color=brown>Dour</FONT></I> has a suggestion of sternness and, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>cheerless</FONT></I>, is seldom applied to anything but people or human qualities: A <I><FONT color=brown>dour</FONT></I> look was all the answer I got on how he like the weather; a <I><FONT color=brown>cheerless</FONT></I> day, overcast and drizzling.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Forbidding</FONT></B> suggests an ominous appearance that promises to be unfriendly or threatening on closer acquaintance: the dank walls and barred windows of the <I><FONT color=brown>forbidding</FONT></I> castle.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Break">BLEAK</A>, <A href="entry://Gloomy">GLOOMY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bright, cheerful, gay, <A href="entry://Joyous">JOYOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Optimistic">OPTIMISTIC</A>, promising, uplifting.</P>

<P>These words refer to behaviour unbecoming to an adult. <B><FONT color=blue>Childish</FONT></B> suggests lack of control or restraint and carries possible connotations of petulance, irrationality, impatience and self-preoccupation: a <I><FONT color=brown>childish</FONT></I> insistence that everyone listen to him; a <I><FONT color=brown>childish</FONT></I> fear of the dark. The word is so negative in tone that it is seldom now used to describe a young person, or even his understandable limitations. <B><FONT color=blue>Childlike</FONT></B> is also not used to describe the young, since it would be obviously tautological. Used of adults, however, it gives a tone in strong contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>childish</FONT></I>. It suggests having the freshness, curiosity or honesty of the young; it gives possible connotations of innocence, lack of inhibition, zest or eagerness: a <I><FONT color=brown>childlike</FONT></I> ability to look at paintings unhampered by preconceptions; He felt an almost <I><FONT color=brown>childlike</FONT></I> wonder at the beauty of the forest. In uses where it is least positive, it still suggests a touching lack of experience or sham: her <I><FONT color=brown>childlike</FONT></I> naïveté in agreeing to go to his hotel room for a nightcap; a <I><FONT color=brown>childlike</FONT></I> unconcern for the rank and title of his assembled guests.</P><P>Unlike the foregoing, <B><FONT color=blue>immature</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>juvenile</FONT></B> may be used in factual reference to the young or things pertaining to them: an immature seedling; a <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile</FONT></I> court. In this case, <I><FONT color=brown>immature</FONT></I> is more general since it can refer to any living thing not fully developed, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile</FONT></I> refers specifically to young human beings. In reference to adults, both words are disapproving in tone, <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile</FONT></I> somewhat less and <I><FONT color=brown>immature</FONT></I> considerably less than <I><FONT color=brown>childish</FONT></I>. [I suppose we are all a little <I><FONT color=brown>immature</FONT></I>, but while I have been guilty of <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile</FONT></I> behaviour from time to time, he is downright <I><FONT color=brown>childish</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Juvenile</FONT></I> indicates behaviour typical of a young person nearing adulthood, and thus may suggest intemperance, extremism, laziness, excessive zeal or idealism, or thoughtless inconsiderateness: a <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile</FONT></I> inability to compromise; a <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile</FONT></I> habit of seeing everything in black and white; <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile</FONT></I> snap judgements. In recent usage, <I><FONT color=brown>immature</FONT></I> has become a fad word for any failing in rationality or lack of understanding in group relations. As such it would be inclusive of behaviour suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>childish</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile</FONT></I>, except that overuse has made it milder sounding, since almost any failing can be considered <I><FONT color=brown>immature</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>immature</FONT></I> wish to be divorced at the first sign of friction; an <I><FONT color=brown>immature</FONT></I> dependence on others for his opinions. Also, the word might specifically refer to behaviour that falls short of that appropriate to a person’s chronological age: <I><FONT color=brown>immature</FONT></I> of him to go off courting as though he were still a young man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Infantile</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>puerile</FONT></B> are the most disapproving of all these words. From their construction, both might be thought capable of neutral description, but <I><FONT color=brown>puerile</FONT></I> is almost never used in this way, and <I><FONT color=brown>infantile</FONT></I> only when used as a technical word; even in such contexts infant is often preferred: <I><FONT color=brown>infantile</FONT></I> paralysis; <I><FONT color=brown>infantile</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>infant</FONT></I>) behaviour. Similarly one would refer to a boy <I><FONT color=brown>boyhood</FONT></I> (not <I><FONT color=brown>puerile</FONT></I>) dreams. <I><FONT color=brown>Infantile</FONT></I>, when applied to other than infants, is in fact an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>childish</FONT></I> and suggests complete self-absorption and helplessness: his wife’s <I><FONT color=brown>infantile</FONT></I> tantrums. The most formal of these words, <I><FONT color=brown>puerile</FONT></I> is also more vague in its condemnation. It can suggest anything callow, weak, stupid, or inept. At its most vague, it can mean simply worthless: <I><FONT color=brown>puerile</FONT></I> efforts to negotiate; the pianist’s <I><FONT color=brown>puerile</FONT></I> performance.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Gullible">GULLIBLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: experienced, <A href="entry://Mature">MATURE</A>, sophisticated.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Choose</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pick</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>select</FONT></B> mean to take one or more from a number of things available ?usually a matter of preference. They may be used as exact synonyms: a man buying a lawn mower <I><FONT color=brown>chooses</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>picks</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>selects</FONT></I>) the one best suited to his needs. However, these words have separate shades of meaning that may make one or another of them more appropriate in a particular context. In the word <I><FONT color=brown>choose</FONT></I>, for example, the emphasis is on the act of will exercised in making the decision and, sometimes, on the finality of the decision. When we say that a young man <I><FONT color=brown>chooses</FONT></I> a career, we imply that he is making a voluntary decision and that he will probably pursue that career for the best of his working life. To <I><FONT color=brown>select</FONT></I> is to <I><FONT color=brown>choose</FONT></I> from several things (we <I><FONT color=brown>choose</FONT></I>, rather than <I><FONT color=brown>select</FONT></I>, one of two alternatives), and it suggests discrimination and a careful weighing of the reasons for the choice: At the beginning of the trial, a great deal of time was spent <I><FONT color=brown>selecting</FONT></I> the jurors. <I><FONT color=brown>Pick</FONT></I> is less precise in meaning than the other two words and can be used to cover situations in which neither decision-making nor discrimination is required: A housewife in a supermarket, confronted by several tins of tomatoes of identical size and quality, will often <I><FONT color=brown>pick</FONT></I> the one nearest to her.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Elect</FONT></B> usually connotes choosing from a limited number of alternatives. In its usual sense, it means to <I><FONT color=brown>choose</FONT></I> a person for office by a majority or plurality of votes. [The high-school class <I><FONT color=brown>elected</FONT></I> him captain; The American people <I><FONT color=brown>elect</FONT></I> a president every four years.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cull</FONT></B> means to <I><FONT color=brown>pick</FONT></I> the good from the bad or, more precisely, the bad from the good: A sheep breeder <I><FONT color=brown>culls</FONT></I> the weak animals from his flock.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Decide">DECIDE</A>, <A href="entry://Discriminate">DISCRIMINATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Forswear">FORSWEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Reject">REJECT</A>.</P>

<P>These words indicate a roundabout way of expressing ideas or of referring to something. <B><FONT color=blue>Circumlocution</FONT></B>, derived from Latin roots that mean speaking around, is quite formal. <B><FONT color=blue>Periphrasis</FONT></B>, derived from comparable Greek roots, is even more formal and more technical in tone. Both pertain to the substitution of lengthy phraseology for more simple expressions: the <I><FONT color=brown>circumlocutions</FONT></I> of a candidate who wished to win friends on both sides of every issue; judicial rulings that are clogged with <I><FONT color=brown>periphrasis</FONT></I>, peppered with whereases, and understandable by no one. <I><FONT color=brown>Circumlocution</FONT></I>, being slightly more common, has gathered more connotations to it; the word can suggest the avoidance of direct statement out of squeamishness, insincerity, self-interest or a misplaced desire for elegance: the emphasis of diplomatic protocol on its own strange set of polite <I><FONT color=brown>circumlocutions</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Periphrasis</FONT></I>, by contrast, is more restricted to a grammatical context and is perhaps more neutral in simply indicating the choice of a longer rather than a shorter expression of comparable function. "In order to" is sometimes a needless <I><FONT color=brown>periphrasis</FONT></I> for "to".</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indirectness</FONT></B>, of course, is a much less formal, much more general, and much clearer synonym for the previous pair of words. It refers to the avoidance of simply or forceful expressions for whatever reason: an <I><FONT color=brown>indirectness</FONT></I> of style that stems from his reliance on the passive voice and his constant reference to himself as "one." By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>euphuism</FONT></B> is highly specific. This word comes from the name of a literary character, <I><FONT color=brown>Euphues</FONT></I>, subject of two Elizabethan works of fiction by John Lyly. It refers to a ridiculous straining after an elegant prose style by clothing a paucity of thought in orotund parallelisms, flowery similes and other verbal frills.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Euphemism</FONT></B>, sometimes confused with <I><FONT color=brown>euphuism</FONT></I>, comes from Greek roots meaning to speak well. It refers to a specific tendency in speech or writing which involves the substituting of a mild, inexact or technical-sounding term for a more forceful, clear or blunt term when the latter is thought capable of giving offence. <I><FONT color=brown>Euphemisms</FONT></I> are commonly substituted for words pertaining to parts of the body, death, sex and bodily functions. "Limb" was a Victorian <I><FONT color=brown>euphemism</FONT></I> for "leg." Some use the <I><FONT color=brown>euphemism</FONT></I> "pass away" instead of saying "die." "The departed" is often used as a <I><FONT color=brown>euphemism</FONT></I> for "the dead."</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Talkative">TALKATIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Verbose">VERBOSE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: brevity, conciseness, condensation, directness, succinctness, terseness.</P>

<P>These words refer to something that lies on all or many sides of something else. <B><FONT color=blue>Circumscribe</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words but the most precise in reference, specifically indicating the drawing of a line round a plane figure so as to touch as many points of the figure as possible: a square <I><FONT color=brown>circumscribed</FONT></I> by a circle. Used to describe geographical situations, it need not adhere to this strict geometrical definition, but it still suggests something hedged in on all sides: a small country completely <I><FONT color=brown>circumscribed</FONT></I> by mountains. In other uses, the point of the word is an emphasis on the restriction of something within set limits: severely <I><FONT color=brown>circumscribing</FONT></I> the freedom to dissent in time of war. <B><FONT color=blue>Encompass</FONT></B> means to take in or embrace. Like <I><FONT color=brown>circumscribe</FONT></I>, it may refer to a line drawn round a figure, but it more particularly indicates something set within a circle. It may, furthermore, suggest a setting of limits, but it more often implies a measuring of natural capacities: a view that <I><FONT color=brown>encompassed</FONT></I> the whole of the valley; a mind that could <I><FONT color=brown>encompass</FONT></I> only a few obvious truths: an erudition that <I><FONT color=brown>encompassed</FONT></I> amazing expanses of abstruse knowledge.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bound</FONT></B> almost exclusively pertains to the setting of limits found in <I><FONT color=brown>circumscribe</FONT></I>. It may not, however, necessarily suggest a total hedging in on all sides by the same medium: a city accessible to motorists from the north, although <I><FONT color=brown>bounded</FONT></I> on the south and east by jungle, and on the west by desert. <B><FONT color=blue>Surround</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests something hedged in on all sides by the same thing, and thus it might be thought a more informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>circumscribe.</FONT></I> <I><FONT color=brown>Surround</FONT></I>, however, very often emphasizes an undesirable, hostile, or dangerous <I><FONT color=brown>circumscribing</FONT></I>: a cabin <I><FONT color=brown>surrounded</FONT></I> by the wilderness; decimated troops <I><FONT color=brown>surrounded</FONT></I> by the enemy; watching the dingoes <I><FONT color=brown>surround</FONT></I> the injured ewe. The word can, of course, be used without negative implications: <I><FONT color=brown>surrounded</FONT></I> by the smiling faces of his friends. <B><FONT color=blue>Encircle</FONT></B> is closest to <I><FONT color=brown>surround</FONT></I> in its generality, but it does specifically suggest a tighter cluster about a central object and most often indicates a deliberate grouping for a definite reason: Oppressed serfs throughout the <I><FONT color=brown>surrounding</FONT></I> countryside joined together to <I><FONT color=brown>encircle</FONT></I> the castle.</P><P>While the previous words suggest, in simplest terms, a two-dimensional <I><FONT color=brown>encircling</FONT></I>, the remaining words all may indicate a three-dimensional gathering of one thing about another. <B><FONT color=blue>Envelop</FONT></B> refers most strictly to such a situation. It suggests the total <I><FONT color=brown>surrounding</FONT></I> of something, especially by folds or layers, so as to cover up or obscure the thing within: a porcelain vase <I><FONT color=brown>enveloped</FONT></I> in cotton; an aircraft <I><FONT color=brown>enveloped</FONT></I> in fog; He <I><FONT color=brown>enveloped</FONT></I> her in the folds of his cloak. In more metaphorical use, it may refer to a pervasive atmosphere or a totally preoccupied state of mind: <I><FONT color=brown>enveloped</FONT></I> by a sense of warm, sleepy contentment. It may also have overtones of protectiveness or secrecy: the overdone love with which she <I><FONT color=brown>enveloped</FONT></I> her son; an episode <I><FONT color=brown>enveloped</FONT></I> in mystery. <B><FONT color=blue>Enclose</FONT></B> is similar to envelop except that the latter often suggests an amorphous material in which something else may become lost or blurred, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>enclose</FONT></I> may suggest a hollowed solid or anything especially designed to fit round something else: a clock enclosed by a glass bell. <I><FONT color=brown>Enclose</FONT></I> suggests specifically a difficulty of access and often carries overtones of imprisonment or protectiveness: radio-active substances enclosed in heavy lead containers; housewives <I><FONT color=brown>enclosed</FONT></I> in a world of drab routine; a sleeping child <I><FONT color=brown>enclosed</FONT></I> in its mother’s arms. <B><FONT color=blue>Contain</FONT></B> may refer to the mere presence of one thing inside another: plants that <I><FONT color=brown>contain</FONT></I> potassium; the safe that <I><FONT color=brown>contained</FONT></I> the jewels. But it may more specifically suggest the resistance of the thing <I><FONT color=brown>contained</FONT></I>: measures that might <I><FONT color=brown>contain</FONT></I> the vandalism of the students. It has also become a recent fad word in the terminology of power politics: the deployment of missile bases to <I><FONT color=brown>contain</FONT></I> the aggressor.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boundary">BOUNDARY</A>, <A href="entry://Confine">CONFINE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>cite</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>adduce</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>quote</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>refer</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are concerned with the presentation of supporting evidence in discussion, analysis or argument. <B><FONT color=blue>Cite</FONT></B> is a highly specific word, precisely directed to this concept. To <I><FONT color=brown>cite</FONT></I> an example is to bring it forward as proof or illustration of a point. <I><FONT color=brown>Cite</FONT></I> almost always suggests a backing up of assertions by authoritative investigation or knowledge, rather than a mere hazarding of guesses. In particular, <I><FONT color=brown>cite</FONT></I> often implies a collection or repository of sources or examples that any other investigator could easily go to for corroboration: The bibliography <I><FONT color=brown>cited</FONT></I> more than a hundred source books that the author had consulted. <I><FONT color=brown>Cite</FONT></I> may also suggest that a complete and detailed presentation of an argument is being given: to <I><FONT color=brown>cite</FONT></I> the reasons behind President Roosevelt’s abstention from war prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.</P><P>Of all these words, <B><FONT color=blue>refer</FONT></B> is the definite in suggesting how much or how little corroborating evidence will be presented. A treatise might merely <I><FONT color=brown>refer</FONT></I> to well-known facts in passing, on the assumption that they will be familiar to everyone. On the other hand, especially in verbal discussions, <I><FONT color=brown>refer</FONT></I> may imply the looking up of authoritative information about the point in question: to <I><FONT color=brown>refer</FONT></I> to the dictionary; turning to the Bible in order to <I><FONT color=brown>refer</FONT></I> to the exact wording of a disputed quotation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Adduce</FONT></B> means to bring forward for proof or consideration, and may refer to an example, argument or item of evidence. It suggests a succinct listing of the details that support a case, although each detail might be sketched rather than developed in full: <I><FONT color=brown>adducing</FONT></I> reasons why the United States should have entered the war in 1939. One might <I><FONT color=brown>refer</FONT></I> to definitive proof that the world is round, but one would have to be more specific in order to <I><FONT color=brown>adduce</FONT></I> the reasons why this is known to be true. In other instances, <I><FONT color=brown>adduce</FONT></I> may be closely synonymous with the other words in this set; but it is much more formal and may seem unduly erudite or stuffy in tone.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Quote</FONT></B> refers to an exact, word-for-word citation of one’s sources. If one <I><FONT color=brown>cites</FONT></I> another person’s arguments, one may be paraphrasing them. But if one claims to be <I><FONT color=brown>quoting</FONT></I> those arguments, then one is responsible for reproducing them exactly as they appear in the source.

<P>These words refer to attempts at removing confusion or making something understandable. <B><FONT color=blue>Clarify</FONT></B> usually pertains to words or actions intended to make clear an earlier event, situation, announcement or state of affairs: a statement isused to <I><FONT color=brown>clarify</FONT></I> his seemingly contradictory views on the proposed merger; contradictory answers that he made no attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>clarify</FONT></I>; adding details to the sketch that would <I><FONT color=brown>clarify</FONT></I> the spatial relationships; a plot structure that needed <I><FONT color=brown>clarifying</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Elucidate</FONT></B> is a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>clarify</FONT></I>. While the root of <I><FONT color=brown>clarify</FONT></I> refers literally to clearness, the root of <I><FONT color=brown>elucidate</FONT></I> refers to light. To <I><FONT color=brown>elucidate</FONT></I> something is to throw light on it. The word’s use reflects this in indicating any enlightening process that puts an end to confusion: searching for the clues that would <I><FONT color=brown>elucidate</FONT></I> the mystery; psychological theories drawn up to <I><FONT color=brown>elucidate</FONT></I> human behaviour. Thus <I><FONT color=brown>elucidate</FONT></I> in its very formality has a wider range of application than <I><FONT color=brown>clarify</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Explicate</FONT></B> is more restricted and specific in use than the foregoing. It refers to a point-by-point discussion of a complex matter, especially as in the paraphrase and analysis of a literary text: asking each student to <I><FONT color=brown>explicate</FONT></I> the difficult poem; popular books that attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>explicate</FONT></I> Einstein’s theories.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Explain</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>interpret</FONT></B> are far less formal than the previous words and have wider ranges of use. A person may <I><FONT color=brown>explain</FONT></I> a thing by describing its form or structure, tracing its origins and development, showing its operation or use, or citing its reasons and the relations of its parts. Hence an expert might <I><FONT color=brown>elucidate</FONT></I> one detail of a complex matter without <I><FONT color=brown>explaining</FONT></I> the whole. In its most informal sense, <I><FONT color=brown>explain</FONT></I> suggests a verbal attempt to justify actions or to make them understood: trying to <I><FONT color=brown>explain</FONT></I> why he had stayed out so late. When it is closer in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>elucidate</FONT></I>, it may suggest a total falling into place of a causal sequence: experiments designed to <I><FONT color=brown>explain</FONT></I> the mechanics of heredity; the discovery of several notes that <I><FONT color=brown>explained</FONT></I> his homicidal behaviour. <I><FONT color=brown>Interpret</FONT></I> is like <I><FONT color=brown>explicate</FONT></I> in suggesting a point-by-point treatment of an earlier situation, pronouncement or event so that it can be understood; it is like <I><FONT color=brown>elucidate</FONT></I> in implying the use of knowledge or insight to cast light on some baffling problem or puzzle, though it differs in stressing personal judgement or understanding: to <I><FONT color=brown>interpret</FONT></I> a symbolic dream; to <I><FONT color=brown>interpret</FONT></I> an obscure piece of writing. In a limited sense, <I><FONT color=brown>interpret</FONT></I> may refer to oral translation from one language to another: A skilled linguist was needed to interpret the statements of the visiting head of state. Less specifically, the word may imply any sort of after-the-fact analysis, in which case it may point to a less exhaustive or technical approach than <I><FONT color=brown>explicate</FONT></I>: a journalist who <I><FONT color=brown>interpreted</FONT></I> economic trends for the layman.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Explanation">EXPLANATION</A>, <A href="entry://Inform">INFORM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: becloud, bedim, befog, complicate, <A href="entry://Confuse">CONFUSE</A>, obfuscate, obscure.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>class</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>caste</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>estate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>order</FONT></B>:

<P>These words, as here considered, refer to groupings in, or divisions of, a stratified society. <B><FONT color=blue>Class</FONT></B> is the most general word. It refers primarily to a social division of society, as the middle <I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I>; but a <I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I> may also be an economic division, as the working <I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I>, a functional division, as the managerial <I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I>; or a division embracing persons with other common characteristics, as the educated <I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Classes</FONT></I> are based on such things as lineage, income and occupation. A <B><FONT color=blue>caste</FONT></B>, by contrast, is a strictly hereditary division of society ?especially one of the four Hindu social <I><FONT color=brown>classes</FONT></I> in India. The highest of these is the Brahman, or priestly, <I><FONT color=brown>caste</FONT></I>. A member of the lowest <I><FONT color=brown>caste</FONT></I> was formerly called an untouchable, his touch having been counted as pollution by Hindus of higher station. A person is able to move from one <I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I> to another; but where a rigid caste system is in effect, he cannot escape from his <I><FONT color=brown>caste</FONT></I>.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>estate</FONT></B> is a <I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I> of people with a distinct political or social status, having in common special duties, privileges, powers or limitations with respect to government. An <I><FONT color=brown>estate</FONT></I> was originally one of the three <I><FONT color=brown>classes</FONT></I> of feudal society in Europe ?the <I><FONT color=brown>Estates</FONT></I> of the Realm being the clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The political power of the press later caused the journalistic fraternity to be dubbed the fourth <I><FONT color=brown>estate</FONT></I>. In a general sense, estate, like <I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I>, may be used to indicate rank, position or social standing: a lady of high <I><FONT color=brown>estate</FONT></I>. Class is also applied to thing or services as a measure of quality: first-<I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I> as opposed to tourist-<I><FONT color=brown>class</FONT></I> accommodation.</P><P>In one sense, <B><FONT color=blue>order</FONT></B> is close to class in indicating a stratum of society or a cohesive social or professional group: the scorn of the aristocracy for the lower orders. Specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> often refers to the rank or position of an ordained Christian clergyman ?a bishop being in the highest <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> of the ministry, a priest in the second, and a deacon in the third. In traditional angelology, <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> designates one of the nine grades or choirs of angels, which are, in ascending rank, angels, archangels, principalities, powers, virtues, dominations or dominions, thrones, cherubim and seraphim. <I><FONT color=brown>Order</FONT></I> may also refer to an honorary society to which members are named by a sovereign as a mark of the highest distinction: The <I><FONT color=brown>Order</FONT></I> of the Garter is the highest <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> of knighthood in Britain.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Club">CLUB</A>, POSITION (rank).</P>

<P>These words refer to anything that is unsoiled by use or neglect or that is untainted by dirt or grime. <B><FONT color=blue>Clean</FONT></B> emphasizes freedom from dirt, grime or stain. A thing may be <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> because it is new, unused or unmarked: a <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> sheet of paper. More often, the word suggests that something has been freed of soil or the marks of use in order to be used again: <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> dishes, <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> sheets. Less concretely, <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> can refer to an absence of fault or failing which combines in some uses with its reference to the absence of marks, implying a place where faults might otherwise be marked down in a list: a <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> slate; a <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> record. The word’s implications of purity further extend to the moral sense, referring to that which is innocent, especially of sexual impropriety: a <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> mind; <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> jokes. <I><FONT color=brown>Clean</FONT></I> can, however, refer simply to what is well-meaning and harmless: good <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> fun.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fresh</FONT></B> is often used in apposition with <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> to emphasize newness or lack of use as well as purity: <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> snow; a <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> shirt. It may also suggest something revivifying in its purity: <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I> air. Used in reference to failings, it suggests, not an absence of faults, but the putting aside of past mistakes: a <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I> start; <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I> approaches. <B><FONT color=blue>Spotless</FONT></B> refers to an actual absence of marks or blemishes. It is, however, more emphatic than <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I>, and carries implications of neatness and tidiness as well: a <I><FONT color=brown>spotless</FONT></I> room. Other wise, the word may simply be a hyperbolic substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I>, though it may differ in describing something never sullied: a <I><FONT color=brown>spotless</FONT></I> record.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stainless</FONT></B> may be used in a way closely resembling <I><FONT color=brown>spotless</FONT></I>. Much more often now, however, it indicates something that cannot be stained, especially something designed with this quality in mind: <I><FONT color=brown>stainless</FONT></I> steel cutlery. In this sense something that is <I><FONT color=brown>stainless</FONT></I> need not necessarily be clean. <I><FONT color=brown>Immaculate</FONT></I>, the most formal of these words, can function like <I><FONT color=brown>spotless</FONT></I> as a hyperbole for <I><FONT color=brown>clean</FONT></I> in all situations: an <I><FONT color=brown>immaculate</FONT></I> suit. On this level, it reflects its Latin root which means literally without spot. But the word also has a wider ranges of application to moral propriety and is particularly relevant in a religious context, meaning sinless: hermits who strove to lead <I><FONT color=brown>immaculate</FONT></I> lives. The doctrine of the <I><FONT color=brown>Immaculate</FONT></I> Conception holds that Jesus was conceived untainted by original sin.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chaste">CHASTE</A>, <A href="entry://Innocent">INNOCENT</A>, <A href="entry://Perfect">PERFECT</A>, <A href="entry://Sanitary">SANITARY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: adulterated, contaminated, <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, grimy, impure, marked, polluted, stained, sullied, tainted.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>clergyman</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cleric</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>divine</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ecclesiastic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>prelate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>religious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>theologian</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to those members of a religion that are set apart from its ordinary followers either by the responsibilities of leadership or by other duties. <B><FONT color=blue>Clergyman</FONT></B> is the generic term for all men set apart in this way; it applies equally well to leaders of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish faiths: cardinals, bishops and other <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I> who met at the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council in Rome; a conference of Lutheran, Presbyterian and Methodist <I><FONT color=brown>clergymen</FONT></I>; a study group composed of Jewish seminarians and <I><FONT color=brown>clergymen</FONT></I>. Just as clergy contrasts with laity, so <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I> contrasts with laymen to distinguish authorized leaders from ordinary members: a closer relationship between <I><FONT color=brown>clergymen</FONT></I> and laymen. In Christian faiths, the word more specifically indicates someone set apart by ordination, someone who is regularly authorized to preach the gospel and administer sacraments; in addition, it can include in Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican usage anyone who lives in holy orders: priests, monks and other <I><FONT color=brown>clergymen</FONT></I>. At its most general, <I><FONT color=brown>clergymen</FONT></I> may be applied to the leaders of other religions when no more appropriate term from such religions suggests itself.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cleric</FONT></B> may refer, like <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I>, to any member of the clergy, but its use is restricted to the more ritualized or hierarchic faiths. Most specifically it refers to someone distinguished by a tonsure, although it now can suggest any <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I> whose ordination is symbolized by clothing markedly different from that of a layman: a procession of <I><FONT color=brown>clerics</FONT></I> in their colourful regalia. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>cleric</FONT></I> may sometimes give a contemptuous tone when used in criticism, not so much of a church itself, but of church leaders regarded as corrupt: <I><FONT color=brown>clerics</FONT></I> who flout their duties and ignore the needs of the faithful.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Theologian</FONT></B> represents a much more specific concept, referring to anyone who formulates or clarifies the doctrines and thinking of a religion; the word may occasionally be applied to members of other than the Western religions: the Hindu <I><FONT color=brown>theologian</FONT></I> Shankara. In any case, the word suggests a learned, philosophical or well-reasoned approach. In theory, <I><FONT color=brown>theologian</FONT></I> can apply to anyone accomplished in such technical discussion, male or female, <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I> or layman. In practice, a theologian has most often been a <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I> of the religion his thinking deals with: the Jewish <I><FONT color=brown>theologian</FONT></I> Maimonides who influence the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas. While the word suggests an official or orthodox approach, this is not always necessarily implied in practice: the <I><FONT color=brown>theologian</FONT></I> Arius whose doctrines were declared heretical in the 4<SUP>th</SUP> century A.D.; recent <I><FONT color=brown>theologians</FONT></I> who formulated the controversial "God-is-dead" theory. While <B><FONT color=blue>divine</FONT></B> may refer in a general way to a <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I>, particularly one highly placed, the word at its most specific refers to a <I><FONT color=brown>theologian</FONT></I> whose doctrines are accepted and honoured by his religion: church <I><FONT color=brown>divines</FONT></I> of the early centuries whose main task was to combat such heresies as Arianism and manicheanism.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ecclesiastic</FONT></B> refers to any <I><FONT color=brown>clergyman</FONT></I> in a church with an emphasis on a clergy arranged in a ranked and structured hierarchy, thus applying particularly to Catholic, Orthodox and such Protestant churches as the Anglican: an <I><FONT color=brown>ecclesiastic</FONT></I> in the Church of England. <B><FONT color=blue>Prelate</FONT></B> more specifically refers to an <I><FONT color=brown>ecclesiastic</FONT></I> of superior rank and authority, as a bishop or cardinal, or to a dignitary of a particular church. This word, even more than <I><FONT color=brown>cleric</FONT></I>, can be given a negative ring by someone critical of the clergy: <I><FONT color=brown>prelates</FONT></I> who grow fat and rich while the people starve.</P><P>While <B><FONT color=blue>religious</FONT></B> is restricted in reference to someone living in holy orders, usually in the context of the more formalized faiths, the word is unique here in that it applies equally well both to a man or woman in such orders: a girl who wished to become a <I><FONT color=brown>religious</FONT></I> and retire to the sheltered life of the convent. [Not always mandatory for parish priests, celibacy nevertheless was always in force for the <I><FONT color=brown>religious</FONT></I>, both monks and nuns.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Minister">MINISTER</A>.</P>

<P>Upward movement is indicated by all these words. <B><FONT color=blue>Climb</FONT></B> suggests most strongly a laborious or tortuous moving upwards: the men who <I><FONT color=brown>climbed</FONT></I> Everest; a car slowly <I><FONT color=brown>climbing</FONT></I> the steep hill; an erratic market <I><FONT color=brown>climbing</FONT></I> to new highs; the aircraft <I><FONT color=brown>climbing</FONT></I> to get above the cloudbank. <B><FONT color=blue>Scale</FONT></B> is closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>climb</FONT></I> in suggesting effort-filled upward movement, but it is more often restricted to the actual physical effort required for someone to surmount an obstacle. It also suggests a skilful dexterity or thoughtful effort: those who would <I><FONT color=brown>scale</FONT></I> the heights; <I><FONT color=brown>scaling</FONT></I> the wall to get word to his compatriots. <B><FONT color=blue>Mount</FONT></B> relates to <I><FONT color=brown>scale</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>climb</FONT></I> in that it can suggest a step-by-step process: slowly <I><FONT color=brown>mounting</FONT></I> the look-out point for a view of the bay; <I><FONT color=brown>mounting</FONT></I> his horse; tidewater slowly <I><FONT color=brown>mounting</FONT></I> the sloping beach.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ascend</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rise</FONT></B>, unlike the foregoing, need not suggest laborious movement up an incline, but may refer instead to perpendicular movement through water or air: the moon <I><FONT color=brown>ascending</FONT></I> a cloudless sky; smoke <I><FONT color=brown>rising</FONT></I> from chimneys. <I><FONT color=brown>Ascend</FONT></I>, when it is used for movement up an incline, is more formal and less vivid than <I><FONT color=brown>climb</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>ascending</FONT></I> the steep face of the mountain. In metaphorical uses, the word can affect a religious or spiritual overtone: a prayer for peace <I><FONT color=brown>ascending</FONT></I> from the hearts of all men. <I><FONT color=brown>Rise</FONT></I> is even less colourful than <I><FONT color=brown>ascend</FONT></I>; because of its openness to implications provided by context, is has a wide range of abstract uses: if prices <I><FONT color=brown>rise</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Arise">ARISE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>clique</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>circle</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>coterie</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>group</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>set</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a small cluster of friends that excludes outsiders and confers status on those who belong. Of these, <B><FONT color=blue>clique</FONT></B> is the most pejorative in tone and points to the fewest members. It also most strongly suggests both secrecy and snobbishness; in its quasi-official rigidity, in fact, it may all but resemble a social club: a clearly defined <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I> of teenage girls who set style and fashion for their whole high school; a <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I> of conservative officers within the War Ministry. No person would describe his closet friends and himself as a <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I> ?except to disparage them and himself. <B><FONT color=blue>Circle</FONT></B>, by contrast, carries no pejorative judgement and could be used descriptively either by an outsider or by a member of a social cluster: a <I><FONT color=brown>circle</FONT></I> of impressionist painters in the 1890s; my <I><FONT color=brown>circle</FONT></I> of friends. The word implies less intimacy than <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I>, but does suggest mutuality of interests, frequency of gathering, and possibly, decorous civility carried out on a more formal social scale than <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I>: Mme. de Staël and her <I><FONT color=brown>circle</FONT></I> of intelligentsia.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Coterie</FONT></B>, although more formal than either, more closely resembles <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>circle</FONT></I>. It is not necessarily so pejorative as <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I>, however, and points to a larger cluster of friends with perhaps wider interests, less exclusive status, and with the possibility of greater social fluidity. While every member of a <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>circle</FONT></I>, for example, would be well acquainted with every other member, the members of a <I><FONT color=brown>coterie</FONT></I> might be more on a more personal or familiar basis. Also, a <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>circle</FONT></I> might point more strictly to sociability as a motivating factor, while <I><FONT color=brown>coterie</FONT></I> may more often suggest some uniting ideal or purpose beyond mere camaraderie: the <I><FONT color=brown>coterie</FONT></I> of Fabian socialists whose ideals were ultimately embodied in the Labour Party.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Group</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>set</FONT></B> are much less restricted in meaning than these other words. <I><FONT color=brown>Group</FONT></I>, when referring to social clusters, may range in suggestiveness from the intense intimacy of <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I> to a much vaguer casualness that includes all the friends and acquaintances one happens to have: my <I><FONT color=brown>group</FONT></I> at college; a <I><FONT color=brown>group</FONT></I> of young mothers who met in the park over their prams. Set indicates a much larger <I><FONT color=brown>group</FONT></I> of members than any of these other words; while it may be used more neutrally to indicate a particular social <I><FONT color=brown>group</FONT></I> that can be classified as to status and similar interests. Where <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I> all but suggests a club, set all but implies a class or caste of people. Most important, members of a <I><FONT color=brown>set</FONT></I> need not even know on another: modish dress that obviously indicated they were members of the fast-living, world-travelling jet <I><FONT color=brown>set</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Set</FONT></I>, used of a smaller <I><FONT color=brown>group</FONT></I>, is even more emphatic about status, although this need not approach the snobbishness implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>clique</FONT></I>: falling in with a <I><FONT color=brown>set</FONT></I> of young executives who spend their weekends on the harbour.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Club">CLUB</A>, <A href="entry://Group">GROUP</A>.</P>

<P>These words all apply to organized groups of people or things. A c<B><FONT color=blue>l</FONT></B>ub suggests intimacy and informality as well as good fellowship. <I><FONT color=brown>Clubs</FONT></I> may be designed for a variety of purposes, but social <I><FONT color=brown>clubs</FONT></I> are usually of an exclusive nature; membership depends upon the personal judgement, feelings or prejudices of the established members rather than upon any objective qualification. Sectional <I><FONT color=brown>clubs</FONT></I>, of course, are less exclusive, but the payment of dues and the attendance of periodic meeting of a more or less social nature characterize all <I><FONT color=brown>clubs</FONT></I>. The word <I><FONT color=brown>club</FONT></I> has lately become popular because of its pleasant connotations of comfort, relaxation and fellowship. Today many people belong to <I><FONT color=brown>clubs</FONT></I> (ex-servicemen’s <I><FONT color=brown>clubs</FONT></I>, sporting <I><FONT color=brown>clubs</FONT></I> of various kinds, businessmen’s <I><FONT color=brown>clubs</FONT></I>) where they may entertain themselves and their friends in an atmosphere different from that prevailing in hotels. We also find this word used in book <I><FONT color=brown>club</FONT></I>, wine <I><FONT color=brown>club</FONT></I> or some other groups constituting potential buyers or patrons. <B><FONT color=blue>Association</FONT></B> applies to more formal and businesslike relationships that may obtain between organizations as well as individuals: the Amateur Athletic <I><FONT color=brown>Association</FONT></I>; the Metal Trades Employers <I><FONT color=brown>Association</FONT></I>; an <I><FONT color=brown>association</FONT></I> of primary producers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Federation</FONT></B> applies especially to a co-operative organization of states or semi-independent groups for a specific, mutual purpose; as to conduct foreign affairs, or, as in the case of the <I><FONT color=brown>Federation</FONT></I> of Australian University Staff Associations, to strengthen the influence of each of its member bodies. The most common sense of <B><FONT color=blue>union</FONT></B> refers to the trade <I><FONT color=brown>union</FONT></I>, an organization of workers that represents the collective interest of its members in dealing with their employer. In another sense <I><FONT color=brown>union</FONT></I> is close to <B><FONT color=blue>league</FONT></B>. A <I><FONT color=brown>union</FONT></I> or league is a combining of forces for some common end: the English Speaking <I><FONT color=brown>Union</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>League</FONT></I> of Nations. But <I><FONT color=brown>union</FONT></I> sometimes signifies a closer and more enduring relationship than <I><FONT color=brown>league</FONT></I>: The United States is often called the <I><FONT color=brown>Union</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fraternity</FONT></B> may refer to a fraternal society such as the Freemasons or to a Greek-letter fraternity of U.S. university students. The latter are usually social and are run very much like <I><FONT color=brown>clubs</FONT></I>; but some fraternities are devoted to service, and others, like Phi Beta Kappa, have an intellectual basis for membership. A <B><FONT color=blue>lodge</FONT></B> is a local branch of a secret or fraternal society. <B><FONT color=blue>Order</FONT></B> denotes a society with common aims and obligations, as a fraternal <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> or a religious <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I>: The <I><FONT color=brown>Order</FONT></I> of Odd Fellows; the Masonic <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I>; the Franciscan <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I>. A religious <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> is an organization of monks, nuns or priests who have taken vows pledging themselves to live under a certain discipline or to perform certain social or religious duties.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clique">CLIQUE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to actions lacking in skill or grace or to the faulty results of such actions. <B><FONT color=blue>Clumsy</FONT></B> indicates blundering or imprecise movement, a propensity for making mistakes, or to results that reflect these things; a <I><FONT color=brown>clumsy</FONT></I> walk; her <I><FONT color=brown>clumsy</FONT></I> attempt to match the colours of the original; a <I><FONT color=brown>clumsy</FONT></I> sweep of his hand that sent the vase toppling; the <I><FONT color=brown>clumsy</FONT></I> dialogue of the play. While the defects suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>clumsy</FONT></I> result from lack of muscular co-ordination, skill, talent or training, <B><FONT color=blue>awkward</FONT></B> suggests similar but less serious defects that stem from misproportion or more especially from an unsettled state of mind: an <I><FONT color=brown>awkward</FONT></I> build; an <I><FONT color=brown>awkward</FONT></I> grammatical construction; a mutual suspicion that made for <I><FONT color=brown>awkward</FONT></I> silences in their talk; shyness that left her flustered and <I><FONT color=brown>awkward</FONT></I>.

It also focuses on the inexpert handling mismanagement of the whole affair. Similarly, <B><FONT color=blue>inept</FONT></B> refers less to physical movement than to an abject and total failure to accomplish a desired result: a completely <I><FONT color=brown>inept</FONT></I> attempt at humour; an <I><FONT color=brown>inept</FONT></I> movie.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ungainly</FONT></B> specifically suggests a lack of grace that may or may not result, like <I><FONT color=brown>awkward</FONT></I>, from some innate misproportion: an <I><FONT color=brown>ungainly</FONT></I> attempt to retrieve the fallen serviette; an <I><FONT color=brown>ungainly</FONT></I> body incapable of agile movement. <B><FONT color=blue>Gawky</FONT></B> is much more emphatic about the physical basis of <I><FONT color=brown>awkward</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>ungainly</FONT></I> action; it may specifically suggest long, thin or attenuated limbs: the usual <I><FONT color=brown>gawky</FONT></I> adolescent. <B><FONT color=blue>Lumbering</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests ungraceful physical misproportion that stems from an over-heavy or outsized build: the big brute who <I><FONT color=brown>lumbered</FONT></I> after me down the stairs; the slow pace of the <I><FONT color=brown>lumbering</FONT></I> wagon.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Gauche">GAUCHE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: adroit, clever, dexterous, graceful, handy, skilful, sure.</P>

<P>All these words mean a lack of order and arrangement. <B><FONT color=blue>Clutter</FONT></B> implies that objects are jumbled together in heaps, while <B><FONT color=blue>disorder</FONT></B> means that they are not in their normal places. <I><FONT color=brown>Clutter</FONT></I> emphasizes the miscellaneous or various nature of the mess, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>disorder</FONT></I> points to the lack of proper arrangement of the individual objects, and thus usually refers to spatial relationships within an area. [Finding a particular book amidst the <I><FONT color=brown>clutter</FONT></I> of papers and books on his desk was indeed a challenge; to find a rare clock in the <I><FONT color=brown>clutter</FONT></I> of an antique shop; Burglars left the premises in a state of <I><FONT color=brown>disorder</FONT></I> ?the contents of every cupboard and drawer scattered about the floors.] <I><FONT color=brown>Disorder</FONT></I> may of course refer to any lack of order: riots and civil <I><FONT color=brown>disorder</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Disarray</FONT></B> refers specifically to the lack of orderly arrangement, and may apply to people, especially if usually in a disciplined arrangement, as well as to things.

<P>These words mean to have knowledge of the existence or fact of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Aware</FONT></B> is the broadest term, and may mean having knowledge of something in side oneself or of some external fact or condition. Such knowledge may be based on the evidence of one’s senses or on the intellect: to be <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I> of hunger pangs; <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I> of a sharp drop in temperature; <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I> of a new trend in public opinion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conscious</FONT></B> at its most restricted is close to <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I> in indicating the mind’s registering of a sensation, perception or state of affairs: conscious of how dim the room had grown as the twilight deepened; <I><FONT color=brown>conscious</FONT></I> of what the other students thought of her. Even on this level, however, the word may suggest the minimal registering of perception, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I> more often implies a keener response or greater alertness that may encompass evaluation or rational judgement: People had been <I><FONT color=brown>conscious</FONT></I> of the problem before, but the new book made them <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I> of its magnitude. <I><FONT color=brown>Conscious</FONT></I>, furthermore, can apply as aware cannot to the waking state in general, as opposed to a sleeping or comatose state: a local anaesthetic under which a person remains <I><FONT color=brown>conscious</FONT></I> throughout the operation. In a psychological context, the word can apply to those contents of the psyche that are present or available to the ego: a <I><FONT color=brown>conscious</FONT></I> hatred of his mother; slowly becoming <I><FONT color=brown>conscious</FONT></I> of his long-buried feeling of inferiority. Less technically, the word can refer to a deliberate or voluntary judgement: urged to make a <I><FONT color=brown>conscious</FONT></I> choice before events decided the question for them.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cognizant</FONT></B> implies knowledge of a more public character than the other words here considered. To say that one was <I><FONT color=brown>cognizant</FONT></I> of a breeze would be absurdly pretentious, but one may without fear of ridicule claim to be <I><FONT color=brown>cognizant</FONT></I> of new methods in the teaching of foreign languages. [A union leader ought to be <I><FONT color=brown>cognizant</FONT></I> of the attitudes and opinions of the rank and file.] <I><FONT color=brown>Cognizant</FONT></I> thus suggests a deliberate effort to know, and the things known are usually of some public importance. <B><FONT color=blue>Mindful</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>cognizant</FONT></I> a rather formal word, emphasizes the giving of attention more than the acquisition of knowledge. [Because I am always <I><FONT color=brown>mindful</FONT></I> of my own mistakes, I am tolerant of the mistakes of others; <I><FONT color=brown>Mindful</FONT></I> of the strong opinions of his electorate, the member voted against the measure.] <B><FONT color=blue>On to</FONT></B> is a colloquial expression meaning <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I> of, especially of something involving deception or skulduggery. It usually expresses a good deal of indignation, if not outright hostility.

<P>These words refer to a relatively low temperature or to an unexcited, disconcerted or unfriendly attitude. In reference to temperature, <B><FONT color=blue>cold</FONT></B> may refer to something desirably low-key: a co<I><FONT color=brown>l</FONT></I>d drink on a hot day. Aside from this situation, however, the word more often connotes an unpleasantly low temperature: <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I> weather; a <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I> wind; numbed through in the <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I> rooms. <B><FONT color=blue>Frigid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>frosty</FONT></B> are intensifications of <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I>, specifically referring to a temperature below freezing. <I><FONT color=brown>Frigid</FONT></I> factually stresses something that has been frozen solid or a temperature permitting this: a week of absolutely <I><FONT color=brown>frigid</FONT></I> weather. <I><FONT color=brown>Frosty</FONT></I> may suggest a slightly warmer temperature, one at which frost first begins to form or breath vapour can be seen: windows turning <I><FONT color=brown>frosty</FONT></I> overnight; <I><FONT color=brown>frosty</FONT></I> winter gales. Like <I><FONT color=brown>frigid</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>gelid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>icy</FONT></B> imply a temperature cold enough to result in the production of ice: a <I><FONT color=brown>gelid</FONT></I> mass of hailstones; a clear but <I><FONT color=brown>icy</FONT></I> day. <I><FONT color=brown>Icy</FONT></I> may also be merely a hyperbole for <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>icy</FONT></I> waters.</P><P>In reference to temperature, <B><FONT color=blue>cool</FONT></B> often suggests something pleasant or mildly low-key: a heat wave followed by <I><FONT color=brown>cool</FONT></I> weather; a winter that was <I><FONT color=brown>cool</FONT></I> but not cold; moving from the direct sun into the <I><FONT color=brown>cool</FONT></I> shade. <B><FONT color=blue>Chilled</FONT></B> refers to someone who has become <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I> or something that has been caused to turn <I><FONT color=brown>cool</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>chilled</FONT></I> to the bone; <I><FONT color=brown>chilled</FONT></I> wine. <B><FONT color=blue>Chilly</FONT></B>, by contrast, refers more often to air or weather midway between cool and <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>chilly</FONT></I> autumn wind; a <I><FONT color=brown>chilly</FONT></I> house. The word, in fact, may suggest an erratic coming and going of winds: <I><FONT color=brown>chilly</FONT></I> gusts.</P><P>When these words refer to emotional states, their interrelations differ. <I><FONT color=brown>Cold</FONT></I> may refer to an unresponsive attitude or, more drastically, to hostility: a book he remained <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I> to from beginning to end; giving him a <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I> look. In their greater intensity, <I><FONT color=brown>frosty</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>icy</FONT></I> usually stress the hostility implicit in cold: replying to her with <I><FONT color=brown>frosty</FONT></I> disdain; moving with an <I><FONT color=brown>icy</FONT></I> anger. <I><FONT color=brown>Frigid</FONT></I>, however, is now so often used specifically of sexual unresponsiveness in women that it may sound odd or comic in any other emotional context: psychotherapy for the <I><FONT color=brown>frigid</FONT></I> woman.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Cool</FONT></I> suggests reserve based on shyness, lack of enthusiasm, or disapproval: a <I><FONT color=brown>cool</FONT></I> response to all his proposals; curt answers filled with a <I><FONT color=brown>cool</FONT></I> contempt. The word may also suggest an ability to remain objective or impartial or to avoid anger or panic: sorting out the arguments with a <I><FONT color=brown>cool</FONT></I> objectivity; keeping a <I><FONT color=brown>cool</FONT></I> head during the crisis. <I><FONT color=brown>Chilly</FONT></I> suggests manners that are stand-offish or openly hostile: bidding a <I><FONT color=brown>chilly</FONT></I> goodnight to the guests who had overstayed. <I><FONT color=brown>Chilled</FONT></I>, by contrast, pertains mostly to a discouraged or horrified reaction to something else: <I><FONT color=brown>chilled</FONT></I> to see our dwindling store of ammunition.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Gelid</FONT></I> has a rather literary tone and connotes the kind of <I><FONT color=brown>cold</FONT></I> numbness produced by unfriendliness, hostility, fear or horror: nervous laughter that turned into <I><FONT color=brown>gelid</FONT></I> silence when she realized his murderous intent.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aloof">ALOOF</A>, <A href="entry://Distant">DISTANT</A>, <A href="entry://Imperturbable">IMPERTURBABLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: balmy, <A href="entry://Hot">HOT</A>, <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>, <A href="entry://Warm">WARM</A>.</P>

<P>These words are all used to describe material that can catch fire. <B><FONT color=blue>Combustible</FONT></B> is the most formal term here and also the most neutral in simply denoting material that will burn easily: <I><FONT color=brown>Combustible</FONT></I> building materials such as laths have been replaced by highly fire-resistant materials such as asbestos fibre-board.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Burnable</FONT></B> is at the other end of the scale from <I><FONT color=brown>combustible</FONT></I> in its relaxed, almost slangy tone.

come
<B><FONT color=blue>come</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>arrive</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gain</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>reach</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to movement towards a goal. <B><FONT color=blue>Come</FONT></B> is the most informal and general of these words. Its emphasis is on movement towards the observer or movement seen from the perspective of the intended or likely goal: the man <I><FONT color=brown>coming</FONT></I> towards me; trains <I><FONT color=brown>coming</FONT></I> into and leaving the station. The word can indicate the actual appearance of something at the goal, but it can also indicate mere movement towards something without suggesting that it is or will be achieved: He was <I><FONT color=brown>coming</FONT></I> home from work when the accident occurred.</P><P>With the remaining words, there is no suggestion of movement either towards or away from the observer. In contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>come</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>arrive</FONT></B> stresses the actual achievement of a goal: If he were <I><FONT color=brown>coming</FONT></I>, he would have <I><FONT color=brown>arrived</FONT></I> by now ?unless something happened to him along the way. The word is otherwise neutral in its overtones, suggesting in itself neither ease nor effort of movement. At its most neutral, <B><FONT color=blue>reach</FONT></B> can suggest a midway point or stop in an ongoing movement: having <I><FONT color=brown>reached</FONT></I> the third chapter before realizing what the author was getting at; hoping to <I><FONT color=brown>reach</FONT></I> Milan by nightfall and Venice the next day. When the word applies to the achievement of a final goal, however, it often suggests the culmination of a slow, painstaking or methodical process: <I><FONT color=brown>reaching</FONT></I> the summit of Everest after years of planning and countless failures. At any rate, the word can suggest more effort than <I><FONT color=brown>arrive</FONT></I> or possibly the working through of a devious or uncertain course: <I><FONT color=brown>reaching</FONT></I> the address after picking his way through a maze of sinuous streets. <B><FONT color=blue>Gain</FONT></B> intensifies the implications of effort inherent in <I><FONT color=brown>reach</FONT></I>. Successful struggle against odds or in the face of peril or uncertainty can be suggested by the word: <I><FONT color=brown>gaining</FONT></I> the embattled city after heavy casualties. Often, the word specifically suggests upward movement: <I><FONT color=brown>gaining</FONT></I> a precarious perch from which to view the procession.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Reach">REACH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Go">GO</A>, <A href="entry://Leave">LEAVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean feeling or conducing to a feeling of contentment, relief or well-being. <B><FONT color=blue>Comfortable</FONT></B> is the most general word in the group and can apply to a variety of personal feelings and to anything that contributes to those feelings. [I feel very <I><FONT color=brown>comfortable</FONT></I> in this chair; The house is not <I><FONT color=brown>comfortable</FONT></I> tonight because of the high humidity; He makes no more than a barely <I><FONT color=brown>comfortable</FONT></I> income, The patient complained that he had not spent a <I><FONT color=brown>comfortable</FONT></I> night.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cosy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>snug</FONT></B> are suggestive of the kind of comfort that comes from warmth, a compact shelter, security and an easy friendliness: to spend a <I><FONT color=brown>cosy</FONT></I> evening in front of a fireplace; a <I><FONT color=brown>snug</FONT></I> holiday cottage that’s just big enough, and isn’t too much of a housekeeping burden for my wife; a <I><FONT color=brown>snug</FONT></I> job that keeps his family well provided for; a <I><FONT color=brown>cosy</FONT></I> dinner party with a few dear old friends.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Restful</FONT></B> implies the comfort that comes from being quiet, at rest or in repose.

<P>These words pertain either to an authoritative statement that someone is to do something or to the giving of knowledgeable advice or guidance. <B><FONT color=blue>Command</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>order</FONT></B> are the least formal of these words referring to the stated demand of a superior. Of these, <I><FONT color=brown>command</FONT></I> is the more formal and more general; it may pertain to an overall plan that is to be executed, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> might pertain more to a limited action or to a detailed part of such a plan: They received headquarters?<I><FONT color=brown>command</FONT></I> to attack at dawn, together with the special orders each unit was to follow. In addition, <I><FONT color=brown>command</FONT></I> is more forceful, peremptory, and less impersonal: Your wish is my <I><FONT color=brown>command</FONT></I>; a standing <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> to remain in uniform during off-duty hours. But <I><FONT color=brown>command</FONT></I> can refer to a position of control: the general’s ten-year <I><FONT color=brown>command</FONT></I> of the infantry division.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Directive</FONT></B> an <B><FONT color=blue>injunction</FONT></B> are considerably more formal than the foregoing and are much more limited and specific in their application. <I><FONT color=brown>Injunction</FONT></I> now pertains mostly to a legal context, there it indicates a court <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> which is backed by the threat of strenuous punishment for disobedience. An <I><FONT color=brown>injunction</FONT></I> often takes the form of a <I><FONT color=brown>command</FONT></I> to refrain from a specified action: an <I><FONT color=brown>injunction</FONT></I> that prevented the building contractor from working at night. <I><FONT color=brown>Directive</FONT></I> refers to <I><FONT color=brown>orders</FONT></I>, often detailed at length, which those in <I><FONT color=brown>command</FONT></I> send down through channels to gain the compliance of all affected personnel. Where the previous words can suggest either oral or written statements, <I><FONT color=brown>directive</FONT></I> most often suggests written guidelines for action. The word can seem to apply, euphemistically, to advice that carries no explicit threat of punishment for disobedience; but the rulings of a <I><FONT color=brown>directive</FONT></I> are usually mandatory and beyond appeal: a <I><FONT color=brown>directive</FONT></I> isused to all executives concerning a step-up in production during the next quarter; a battalion’s <I><FONT color=brown>directive</FONT></I> on changes in the dress uniform; the vice-chancellor’s <I><FONT color=brown>directive</FONT></I> on admission procedure.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Direction</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>instruction</FONT></B> both have applications referring to <I><FONT color=brown>orders</FONT></I> that may not be contravened; in this sense both are extremely formal. <I><FONT color=brown>Direction</FONT></I> would suggest a less detailed verbal or written statement than <I><FONT color=brown>directive</FONT></I>; it is also less forceful and more euphemistic in tone: a <I><FONT color=brown>direction</FONT></I> on staff-appointment practices that was sent down to the personnel department. Often it can apply to informative but mandatory guidelines: the company’s <I><FONT color=brown>directions</FONT></I> concerning the issuance of new share certificates. In the context of <I><FONT color=brown>orders</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>instruction</FONT></I> stresses that a desired action cannot be done without including the necessary information as part of the command: junior officers awaiting the <I><FONT color=brown>instructions</FONT></I> of the company commander; the judge’s <I><FONT color=brown>instructions</FONT></I> to the jurors; she left detailed <I><FONT color=brown>instructions</FONT></I> to the maid about preparations for the party. When the giving of information is not suggested by the word, it can be even more euphemistic than <I><FONT color=brown>direction</FONT></I>: the sergeant’s <I><FONT color=brown>instruction</FONT></I> to fall out for reveille.</P><P>The last pair pertain more often and less formally to the giving of knowledgeable advice or guidance. In the plural, both can indicate a programmatic or diagrammatic plan for a relatively complicated actions that one wishes or chooses to perform. <I><FONT color=brown>Directions</FONT></I> would be more appropriate for a one-time action, <I><FONT color=brown>instructions</FONT></I> for an action one may wish to learn by heart or perform more than once: printed <I><FONT color=brown>directions</FONT></I> for assembling the components of the sound system; <I><FONT color=brown>instructions</FONT></I> for using the electric frying pan. <I><FONT color=brown>Direction</FONT></I> can apply, of course, to information about reaching a place: She asked for <I><FONT color=brown>directions</FONT></I> to get to the railway station. <I><FONT color=brown>Instruction</FONT></I> most commonly relates to an entirely separate context pertaining to teaching and learning.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Demand">DEMAND</A>, <A href="entry://Law">LAW</A>, <A href="entry://Request">REQUEST</A>, <A href="entry://Require">REQUIRE</A>, <A href="entry://Teach">TEACH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Consent">CONSENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things that are roughly similar but not exactly alike. <B><FONT color=blue>Compare</FONT></B> suggests that one thing is like another in some significant way, however unlike in others: a war that <I><FONT color=brown>compares</FONT></I> to the Korean conflict in its evident stalemate of constructive alternatives.

The word has its own area of meaning, however, in suggesting things that are alike in that they match or complement each other: an availability of funds that seldom <I><FONT color=brown>corresponds</FONT></I> to the needs of units at work in the field. <B><FONT color=blue>Parallel</FONT></B> can also be used as a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>resemble</FONT></I>, but most often it suggests the separateness of two similar things: space research in Russia which <I><FONT color=brown>parallels</FONT></I> that in the United States; proposals that not only <I><FONT color=brown>paralleled</FONT></I> but actually preceded Darwin’s.</P><P>With <B><FONT color=blue>approximate</FONT></B>, the emphasis is on the roughness of the likeness: a bill that only <I><FONT color=brown>approximated</FONT></I> the demands of the opposition. The word may also suggest that one thing falls short of matching another in obvious fashions. <B><FONT color=blue>Approach</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>approximate</FONT></I> in suggesting that one thing cannot measure up to something with which it is <I><FONT color=brown>compared</FONT></I>; the special emphasis here, however, is on quantity or volume: share-market levels that only <I><FONT color=brown>approached</FONT></I> previous highs. Often, the word emphasizes a lower level: a book that <I><FONT color=brown>approaches</FONT></I> his others in quality.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Savour of</FONT></B> suggests that one thing only vaguely <I><FONT color=brown>compares</FONT></I> to another in some almost elusive way. Thus the amount of similarity suggested is even less than for <I><FONT color=brown>approximate</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>approach</FONT></I>: a novel that <I><FONT color=brown>savours of</FONT></I> a feeble attempt to mimic Joyce; a northern port that nevertheless somehow <I><FONT color=brown>savoured of</FONT></I> the Mediterranean in its whitewashed houses and tiled roofs. While <I><FONT color=brown>savour of</FONT></I> can suggest equally well an advantageous or unfortunate likeness, the more pungent and colloquial <B><FONT color=blue>smack of</FONT></B> almost exclusively suggests an undesirable similarity: an offer that <I><FONT color=brown>smacks of</FONT></I> bribery. Both words tend to relate a single example to a larger category of things which it resembles, however distantly.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Counterpart">COUNTERPART</A>, <A href="entry://Duplicate">DUPLICATE</A>, <A href="entry://Similar">SIMILAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: contrast, oppose.</P>

<P>These words all denote the urging or driving of a person to do something or the obtaining of the performance of some action, all by the use of irresistible physical or moral force. <B><FONT color=blue>Compel</FONT></B> may have as its agent a person, an impersonal entity, a law, an action or a set of conditions, and its object may be a person or an action. A parent may <I><FONT color=brown>compel</FONT></I> his child to do his lessons by threatening to suspend his allowance; the government <I><FONT color=brown>compels</FONT></I> young men to perform military service; the law <I><FONT color=brown>compels</FONT></I> one to report one’s income on pain of penalty; an attack <I><FONT color=brown>compels</FONT></I> one to defend oneself; a recession may <I><FONT color=brown>compel</FONT></I> an employer to lay off many of his employees; the government may take steps to <I><FONT color=brown>compel</FONT></I> compliance with the law.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Force</FONT></B> suggests an actual physical process, the use of power, energy or strength to accomplish something or to subdue resistance: to <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I> a confession out of someone; to <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I> the enemy back; to <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I> a lock; to <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I> someone to change an opinion; to <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I> a smile. <B><FONT color=blue>Coerce</FONT></B> can imply the actual use of <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I> but very often suggests its potential in an attempt to secure the surrender of the will: A child may be <I><FONT color=brown>coerced</FONT></I> into obedience by physical punishment or by the threat of it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Constrain</FONT></B> has connotations of repression, restriction, confinement or limitation. It means to <I><FONT color=brown>compel</FONT></I>, but often suggests that the action being prompted or urged is in a negative direction or at least away from that which one may consider positive or pleasant: a man who was <I><FONT color=brown>constrained</FONT></I> by his weak heart to give up all forms of strenuous exercise.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>necessitate</FONT></B> and to <B><FONT color=blue>oblige</FONT></B>, as here considered, mean to make an action necessary by the imposition of conditions that must be reacted to.

<P>These words refer to two or more people or factions struggling against each other to win a given objective. <B><FONT color=blue>Compete</FONT></B> is the most general of these, applying to the widest range of situations: pianists <I><FONT color=brown>competing</FONT></I> in the contest; football teams <I><FONT color=brown>competing</FONT></I> for the premiership; candidates <I><FONT color=brown>competing</FONT></I> for the office; armies <I><FONT color=brown>competing</FONT></I> for victory in the battle; businesses <I><FONT color=brown>competing</FONT></I> for the biggest slice of the market. As can be seen, the objective implied by this word can be, most concretely, a prize or award that is won by a single confrontation, or, more abstractly, a share in something that falls to one side for its continuing effort: television programmes <I><FONT color=brown>competing</FONT></I> for the largest share of the audience.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Contend</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vie</FONT></B> suggest, more strictly, the moment of direct confrontation, and thus are narrowed to one possibility for <I><FONT color=brown>compete</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Contend</FONT></I>, however, adds a note of actual hostility or serious disagreement, where compete may suggest none; furthermore, the word often suggests a dispute carried on verbally, as in a debate: speakers who fell to <I><FONT color=brown>contending</FONT></I> about the least important points in the proposal. Even when the verbal implication is not present, the animus often remains: forces <I><FONT color=brown>contending</FONT></I> bitterly to win the uncommitted delegates. The implications of vie stress a series of countering manoeuvres in an ongoing struggle: neighbours continually <I><FONT color=brown>vying</FONT></I> with each other as to who could display the greater number of status symbols. The word is, however, more like <I><FONT color=brown>compete</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>contend</FONT></I> in lacking overtones of hostility.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Oppose</FONT></B> may often, by implication, restrict the competing ides to two: extroversion, as opposed to introversion; pre-selection ballots in which may <I><FONT color=brown>compete</FONT></I> for the right to <I><FONT color=brown>oppose</FONT></I> the other party’s choice in the main election. This narrowing of sides to tow is not always present in the word: a debate in which many factions <I><FONT color=brown>opposed</FONT></I> one another. In any case, <I><FONT color=brown>oppose</FONT></I> does stress the choosing of clearly defined sides and suggests a greater rigidity of position than any of these words. It may suggest hostility, like <I><FONT color=brown>contend</FONT></I>, or at least a serious discrepancy of views not easily compromised: attitudes towards drug addiction that were sharply <I><FONT color=brown>opposed</FONT></I> to each other. <B><FONT color=blue>Rival</FONT></B> can be specifically used to suggest a struggle of two or more sides to outdo each other: candidates who <I><FONT color=brown>rival</FONT></I> each other in popularity; dresses that <I><FONT color=brown>rival</FONT></I> each other in vulgarity. Even more specifically, the word may suggest that one performance nearly matches another: domestic wines that <I><FONT color=brown>rival</FONT></I> the best French imports; a role in which she <I><FONT color=brown>rivals</FONT></I> the best acting she has previously shown us. These special applications of the word, in this context, make it the most restricted in meaning of words grouped here.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Argue">ARGUE</A>, <A href="entry://Controversy">CONTROVERSY</A>, <A href="entry://Fight">FIGHT</A>, <A href="entry://Opponent">OPPONENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Coincide">COINCIDE</A>, collaborate, co-operate.</P>

<P>These words are applied to persons who exhibit more than average acquired or native skill in the performance of some act or operation. <B><FONT color=blue>Competent</FONT></B> attributes to the subject the ability to carry out the requirements of a specific task. By implication, the completed task is one that can be rated objectively as being either satisfactory or unsatisfactory: No <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I> tax accountant could possibly have made such egregious errors in making out your return. Thus, while <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I> can suggest expertise in a complicated field, adequacy rather than excellence may be indicated by the word. A performing artist, for example, might be insulted if described by this word: <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I> piano-playing that nevertheless lacked inspiration and nuance.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Able</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>capable</FONT></B> at their most neutral may indicate the practicable or possible: an infant barely <I><FONT color=brown>able</FONT></I> to walk. <I><FONT color=brown>Capable</FONT></I> is stronger here in indicating potential, possibly unsuspected, whether for good or ill: a husband <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> of more tenderness than his wife had ever allowed him to express; totalitarian governments <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> of the most unspeakable enormities. Where the words approach <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I> in referring to above-average skill, <I><FONT color=brown>able</FONT></I> suggests versatility and resourcefulness and <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> a practical, problem-solving approach: an <I><FONT color=brown>able</FONT></I> architect; a <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> stenographer. <I><FONT color=brown>Capable</FONT></I> stresses trained proficiency for a specific task, whereas able suggests a wider perspective or potential: <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> lawyers, well-schooled in the intricacies of company law; <I><FONT color=brown>able</FONT></I> children, eager for knowledge, though thwarted by a lack of training in the fundamentals of reading. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> can be applied to things as well as animals: an electronic computer <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> of storing millions of bits of information; a shipyard <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> of producing two nuclear submarines a month. <I><FONT color=brown>Able</FONT></I>, on the other hand, applies only to creatures <I><FONT color=brown>capable</FONT></I> of performing an action.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Qualified</FONT></B> stresses the possession of required skills and is generally applied to professions or trades for which a minimum of schooling or training is required. A <I><FONT color=brown>qualified</FONT></I> teacher has completed the academic training prescribed, but is not necessarily <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Efficient</FONT></B> adds to <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I> the idea of a skill in making the most of the time and material available. A mechanic who is <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I> and efficient will perform a repair job more quickly and cheaply than a mechanic who is merely <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fit</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>good</FONT></B> are general words often used in place of the other words in this list. <I><FONT color=brown>Fit</FONT></I> is usually used predicatively: the manager is not <I><FONT color=brown>fit</FONT></I> for his position (meaning not <I><FONT color=brown>qualified</FONT></I>, not <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I>, not <I><FONT color=brown>efficient</FONT></I>). The specific meaning of good, when used in this sense, is indicated by the context. A <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> teacher is both <I><FONT color=brown>qualified</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> manager is both <I><FONT color=brown>competent</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>efficient</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adequate">ADEQUATE</A>, <A href="entry://Excellent">EXCELLENT</A>, <A href="entry://Genius">GENIUS</A>, <A href="entry://Skill">SKILL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deficient">DEFICIENT</A>, incompetent, inefficient, unfit.</P>

<P>These words refer to the action of finding fault with one’s circumstances. <B><FONT color=blue>Complain</FONT></B> is the most general and also the most neutral of these, suggesting either justified or unjustified dissatisfaction with one’s situation: They <I><FONT color=brown>complained</FONT></I> about the terrible brutality with which they were treated; <I><FONT color=brown>complaining</FONT></I> about imaginary slights from the neighbours. <B><FONT color=blue>Bewail</FONT></B> was once similar to complain in its neutrality, but its archaic flavour now makes it suitable only for the unsympathetic satire of complaining that is motivated by self-pity, especially when the subject is a woman: like a tedious Puccini heroine <I><FONT color=brown>bewailing</FONT></I> her sad fate. <B><FONT color=blue>Grumble</FONT></B> suggests an habitual ill-humour, especially of a man, that does not quite expect to be taken seriously: husbands who <I><FONT color=brown>grumble</FONT></I> every summer as they dutifully pack the car for the family holiday; prisoners <I><FONT color=brown>grumbling</FONT></I> over the poor quality of institutional food. <B><FONT color=blue>Whine</FONT></B> implies a high-pitched, self-pitying tone, often sued for a continually complaining or nagging woman or for a petulant child; its use suggests complete lack of sympathy for the subject: The patient <I><FONT color=brown>whined</FONT></I> on and on about how unfairly her psychoanalyst had treated her. If applied to a man, it suggests weak or cowardly behaviour: he <I><FONT color=brown>whined</FONT></I> about his bad luck while others put out the fire.</P><P>The rest of these words range from the extremely informal to slang. They also range, in the order of their discussion, towards less and less sympathy for the subject. <B><FONT color=blue>Gripe</FONT></B> can be used for any fruitless expression of dissatisfaction, but is especially pertinent to military life: The officers were told to beware of soldiers who have nothing to <I><FONT color=brown>gripe</FONT></I> about. This context has emphasized the word as a normal everyday <I><FONT color=brown>complaining</FONT></I> about trivial things; it would not be used for outraged indignation or even serious dissatisfaction. <B><FONT color=blue>Whinge</FONT></B> is much more common than <I><FONT color=brown>whine</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>gripe</FONT></I> for continual petty expression of dissatisfaction: always <I><FONT color=brown>whingeing</FONT></I> about not getting a fair go; farmers who <I><FONT color=brown>whinged</FONT></I> about too much rain when they weren’t <I><FONT color=brown>whingeing</FONT></I> about too little. <B><FONT color=blue>Grouse</FONT></B> implies a greater animus than <I><FONT color=brown>gripe</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>whinge</FONT></I> and may suggest a more pointed lashing out in accusation or insult: <I><FONT color=brown>grousing</FONT></I> about the food only when the cook could overhear them. <B><FONT color=blue>Beef</FONT></B> works as an intensification of gripe but does not necessarily suggest the bitterness of <I><FONT color=brown>grouse</FONT></I>; it can suggest an unjustified <I><FONT color=brown>complaining</FONT></I>: They <I><FONT color=brown>beefed</FONT></I> about mistreatment only to get front-page treatment in the newspapers. <B><FONT color=blue>Bellyache</FONT></B> suggests <I><FONT color=brown>complaining</FONT></I> that is interminable, tiresome and completely without justification: continually <I><FONT color=brown>bellyaching</FONT></I> no matter how his room-mates tried to shut him up. The slang word <B><FONT color=blue>bitch</FONT></B> is extremely general in its reference to <I><FONT color=brown>complaining</FONT></I>; it can range in application from the fruitless dissatisfaction indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>gripe</FONT></I> to the bitterness of <I><FONT color=brown>grouse</FONT></I>: He <I><FONT color=brown>bitched</FONT></I> about the weather, the food and anything else that crossed his mind; The <I><FONT color=brown>bitched</FONT></I> about the favouritism the teacher showed to the daughter of the headmistress.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deplore">DEPLORE</A>, <A href="entry://Disapproval">DISAPPROVAL</A>, <A href="entry://Upset">UPSET</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: applaud, approve, <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a pleasant or tolerant manner, open to other people’s demands or desires. <B><FONT color=blue>Compliant</FONT></B> suggests a passive nature readily moulded to conform to the wishes of others, one easily persuaded with little effort: meekly <I><FONT color=brown>compliant</FONT></I> to even his harshest expectations. <B><FONT color=blue>Suggestible</FONT></B> is a less formal word for the same idea, but it has an additional implication indicating a naïve or unguarded sensibility that can be influenced even by subtle or indirect methods: The disapproved of showing such violence-ridden films to <I><FONT color=brown>suggestible</FONT></I> children.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Willing</FONT></B> stresses a more conscious decision to do something and does not, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>compliant</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>suggestible</FONT></I>, suggest an innately weak or conforming nature: informing her that he would be <I><FONT color=brown>willing</FONT></I> to run the errand for her; <I><FONT color=brown>willing</FONT></I>, eager students. On the other hand, <B><FONT color=blue>obliging</FONT></B> refers not to a conscious choice but to a nature that is cheerfully ready to assist or that will permit someone else to satisfy a wish: an <I><FONT color=brown>obliging</FONT></I> stewardess; teenage girls who feel they must be <I><FONT color=brown>obliging</FONT></I> on dates or become unpopular. <B><FONT color=blue>Agreeable</FONT></B> stresses the cheerful side of <I><FONT color=brown>obliging</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> personality. It may also suggest anything that is simply pleasurable: an <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> climate. But the word, in another use, can suggest an even more <I><FONT color=brown>willing</FONT></I> and open attitude than <I><FONT color=brown>obliging</FONT></I>: finding that she was <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> to anything he suggested. <B><FONT color=blue>Accommodating</FONT></B> refers to people who are <I><FONT color=brown>willing</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>obliging</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> in the sense of preparedness to do or supply what is wanted: In our search for local historical material the storekeeper was most <I><FONT color=brown>accommodating</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Complaisant</FONT></B> in one of its uses is simply a more formal term for <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>obliging</FONT></I>, but with a greater stress on the conforming character suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>complaint</FONT></I>: her <I><FONT color=brown>complaisant</FONT></I> eagerness to please. The word has a special use, however, to suggest a cheerful or hypocritical indifference to strict moral standards, either in others or oneself: parents who are permissive and <I><FONT color=brown>complaisant</FONT></I> about their children’s behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Broad-minded</FONT></B> is in some ways a more informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>complaisant</FONT></I> in this context; it suggests a lax regard for moral standards, although it does not necessarily imply a cheerful attitude. In other contexts the word might suggest an admirable ability to see all sides of a question.

<P>These words all refer to parts of a whole. <B><FONT color=blue>Component</FONT></B> refers to a part that functions in association with other parts but that can easily be detached from them; this is in contrast to an organic whole in which the parts are fused or have lost their individual identity within the larger entity. In choosing hi-fi equipment, for example, one can buy separate <I><FONT color=brown>component</FONT></I>, such as speakers, turntable and amplifier, and wire them together oneself. Or one can buy a pre-packaged console, designed as a single unit. The word can suggest a more intimate relationship, as in chemistry, where it refers to a substance that in varying degrees is present in a mixture without being chemically integrated into it; in this case, a change in appearance or apparent loss of identity may be indicated: Salt is a <I><FONT color=brown>component</FONT></I> of sea water. <B><FONT color=blue>Ingredient</FONT></B> is a more general word, referring equally well to the unaltered substances mixed together in an amorphous mass and to the fused or transformed parts of an entity or organic whole: Turmeric is an <I><FONT color=brown>ingredient</FONT></I> of curry powder; a novel that contains all the <I><FONT color=brown>ingredients</FONT></I> of good mystery story.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Element</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>constituent</FONT></B> both refer more strictly to essential, necessary or intrinsic parts of a whole. <I><FONT color=brown>Element</FONT></I> comes from a Latin root meaning first principal; this is reflected in its use to indicate the rudiments of a subject: the <I><FONT color=brown>elements</FONT></I> of good writing. As in this example, the word’s stress is often on simple or basic parts of a more complex whole. In chemistry, the word refers to those basic substances, such as oxygen, mercury and copper, that are irreducible by ordinary chemical mans and that are the building blocks of all matter. <I><FONT color=brown>Constituent</FONT></I> refers more generally to a part that is necessary to the functioning of a whole. Such a part often loses it individual identity completely in contributing to the new entity; conversely, withdrawing it from the whole would drastically change the larger entity: The <I><FONT color=brown>element</FONT></I> hydrogen is a constituent of water.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Addition">ADDITION</A>, <A href="entry://Part">PART</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: entity, <A href="entry://Total">WHOLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to pieces of non-fiction writing. <B><FONT color=blue>Composition</FONT></B> indicates a formal work that is planned in advance rather than improvisatory in character.

The word emphasizes organization round a single topic, may suggest briefer treatment, and is even less likely than <I><FONT color=brown>composition</FONT></I> to require factual research: a class <I><FONT color=brown>exercise</FONT></I> of three hundred words. <B><FONT color=blue>Theme</FONT></B> is sometimes used in a similar sense, but this word’s main function is to refer to the dominant idea of any piece of writing: the <I><FONT color=brown>theme</FONT></I> of alienation in his study of middle-class culture.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Essay</FONT></B> is a much more general word than those above. While it may be used in place of any of them to refer to a writing assignment in school, the word more widely indicates any sort of non-fiction writing shorter than book-length, whether scholarly, humorous, propagandist or reflective. The word, moreover, may suggest any approach from the extremely informal and personal to the solemn, stately or stylized: the refreshing irreverence of Addis’s chatty <I><FONT color=brown>essays</FONT></I>; the Ciceronian elegance that Carlyle attempted in his early <I><FONT color=brown>essays</FONT></I>; howlingly funny about the perils of suburban living. <B><FONT color=blue>Article</FONT></B> is restricted to any piece of non-fiction that has appeared in a newspaper, magazine or journal; it ranges in reference from the briefest and most utilitarian news release through all the possibilities inherent in <I><FONT color=brown>essay</FONT></I>, including the more abstruse scholarly or scientific study: an <I><FONT color=brown>article</FONT></I> giving up-to-the-minute election returns; an <I><FONT color=brown>article</FONT></I> treating the effects of radiation on arthropods.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Paper</FONT></B> has two areas of relevance. One relates to <I><FONT color=brown>composition</FONT></I> or exercise in referring to a written assignment for a school class or to a tutorial <I><FONT color=brown>exercise</FONT></I> for a university group. [His <I><FONT color=brown>paper</FONT></I> was well received by the class.] In this use, the word may suggest any sort of approach, from a demonstration of writing ability to the presentation of factual research. The word’s other use refers to a scholarly <I><FONT color=brown>essay</FONT></I> read to one’s colleagues or to a scholarly article published in a learned journal: a <I><FONT color=brown>paper</FONT></I> on disturbances in the earth’s magnetic field. <B><FONT color=blue>Treatise</FONT></B> indicates an exclusively scholarly context, referring to any presentation from <I><FONT color=brown>essay</FONT></I>- to book-length in which conclusions are drawn from a body of data in a formal and systematic way: a <I><FONT color=brown>treatise</FONT></I> on the development of the Gregorian chant.</P><P>The remaining pair of words also is restricted to a scholarly or academic context. <B><FONT color=blue>Thesis</FONT></B> may suggest briefer or less exhaustive treatment that <I><FONT color=brown>treatise</FONT></I>, pointing to the establishing and defending of a principle: a <I><FONT color=brown>thesis</FONT></I> in which he corroborates Keynes’s theory of deficit spending. Like <I><FONT color=brown>theme</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>thesis</FONT></I> may also refer to the dominant idea of contention of a piece of writing, although it pertains mainly to argumentative non-fiction: a collection of <I><FONT color=brown>essays</FONT></I> each of which illustrates his <I><FONT color=brown>thesis</FONT></I> that modern novelists are unable to create memorable women characters. Most concretely, <I><FONT color=brown>thesis</FONT></I> refers to the extended paper, possibly of book-length, that is sometimes required of candidates for a Master’s degree and always for a Ph.D. degree. <B><FONT color=blue>Dissertation</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words and, when used instead of thesis, suggests the most formal sort of writing as well. It may refer to any reasoned treatment, like <I><FONT color=brown>treatise</FONT></I>, but most concretely it indicates such a work, usually of book-length, when it is a requirement for a Ph.D. or other doctoral degree: a <I><FONT color=brown>dissertation</FONT></I> analyzing cold-war strategies. The word may sometimes be used pejoratively for any long-winded and pompous piece of exposition; giving us another dreary <I><FONT color=brown>dissertation</FONT></I> on the evils of imperialism.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Report">REPORT</A>, <A href="entry://Write">WRITE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to confinement or weightiness in a relatively small space. <B><FONT color=blue>Compact</FONT></B> in its most general use suggests a physique that is small but firm and shapely. In a more specific and technical sense, <I><FONT color=brown>compact</FONT></I> suggests that the essentials of something useful have been reduced to a smaller scale for convenience: a <I><FONT color=brown>compact</FONT></I> car; <I><FONT color=brown>compact</FONT></I> luggage for air travel. An intensification of this trend towards utilitarian smallness is designated by the fairly recent <B><FONT color=blue>miniaturized</FONT></B>, which refers to the making of smaller and smaller electronic equipment through the use of transistors; this makes the inclusion of more equipment feasible in situations where bulk and weight are critical, as in space travel: the <I><FONT color=brown>miniaturized</FONT></I> computer; the <I><FONT color=brown>miniaturized</FONT></I> radio.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Solid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dense</FONT></B> emphasize weightiness, but <I><FONT color=brown>solid</FONT></I> does not necessarily suggest reduction to a small space, only the rigidity or firmness of a material. In reference to a physique, it suggests one without fat or flabbiness: <I><FONT color=brown>solid</FONT></I> muscle. <I><FONT color=brown>Dense</FONT></I> suggests the crowding of a heavy substance into a confined space; it may, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>solid</FONT></I>, refer to gases or liquids as well as solids: <I><FONT color=brown>dense</FONT></I> fog; a <I><FONT color=brown>dense</FONT></I> forest.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Concise</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>condensed</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>compressed</FONT></B> suggest progressively greater confinement in space; one use of this progression is to suggest brevity in writing or a lack of wordiness. <I><FONT color=brown>Concise</FONT></I> suggests the use of exactly as many words as are required to express something and no more; it would apply more usually to technical, factual work, but may apply to imaginative prose: a <I><FONT color=brown>concise</FONT></I> report; the <I><FONT color=brown>concise</FONT></I> sentences of Hemingway. <I><FONT color=brown>Condensed</FONT></I> suggests the boiling sown of a longer piece of writing to its rudiments: a <I><FONT color=brown>condensed</FONT></I> book. <I><FONT color=brown>Compressed</FONT></I> suggests extreme conciseness, but not necessarily that something longer has been shortened: a <I><FONT color=brown>compressed</FONT></I> statement that will explain the already <I><FONT color=brown>condensed</FONT></I> report. <I><FONT color=brown>Condensed</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>compressed</FONT></I> also have specific uses in the physical sciences. <I><FONT color=brown>Condensed</FONT></I> refers to the heating of a liquid so that water is driven off and a <I><FONT color=brown>denser</FONT></I> or semi-solid substance remains: <I><FONT color=brown>condensed</FONT></I> milk. <I><FONT color=brown>Compressed</FONT></I> in this context refers to the putting of a gas under pressure to make it occupy less space: <I><FONT color=brown>compressed</FONT></I> air.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Constricted</FONT></B> suggests extreme confinement in general, with an added note of uncomfortable limitation: <I><FONT color=brown>constricted</FONT></I> movement in the crowded bus.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Minute">MINUTE</A>, <A href="entry://Shorten">SHORTEN</A>, <A href="entry://Small">SMALL</A>, <A href="entry://Terse">TERSE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: extended, loose, <A href="entry://Verbose">VERBOSE</A>.</P>

<P>These words describe actions that are judged to be inescapably necessary. <B><FONT color=blue>Compulsory</FONT></B> suggests that someone in authority has imposed a course of action that may not be departed from <I><FONT color=brown>compulsory</FONT></I> attendance of classes. It may further suggest that the <I><FONT color=brown>compulsory</FONT></I> ruling will be enforcing, by coercion if necessary, and that violators will be punished: <I><FONT color=brown>compulsory</FONT></I> blacklisting. <B><FONT color=blue>Mandatory</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>compulsory</FONT></I> in suggesting an imposed rule: <I><FONT color=brown>mandatory</FONT></I> silence in the library. In contrast, it is milder than <I><FONT color=brown>compulsory</FONT></I> in that it stops short of suggesting coercion and punishment as methods of enforcing the ruling.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Binding</FONT></B> also describes a ruling handed down by an authority, but it may specifically suggest a one-time decision concerning a specific dispute between two parties who agree beforehand to abide by the results: <I><FONT color=brown>binding</FONT></I> arbitration. It may also suggest that earlier, more tentative rulings have been submitted to a final authority. [The teacher’s <I><FONT color=brown>compulsory</FONT></I> ruling against wearing Bermuda shorts to class was referred to the principal, whose decision would be <I><FONT color=brown>binding</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Obligatory</FONT></B> is like binding in its legal sense. In a more general use, however, it suggests something expected or made necessary by morality or conscience, rather than by a higher authority as in the previous words: the <I><FONT color=brown>obligatory</FONT></I> chaperone at teenage parties. As such, its force is more what should be done than what is or must be done: attendance at tutorial classes is <I><FONT color=brown>obligatory</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Imperative</FONT></B> refers to a necessity dictated by circumstance rather than by an authority or a code of morality: <I><FONT color=brown>imperative</FONT></I> to get food and water before sundown. If used to refer to an imposed rule, it is more like <I><FONT color=brown>mandatory</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>compulsory</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>De rigueur</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>obligatory</FONT></I>, but is milder in referring to those acts or observance considered necessary according to etiquette or required by good form; it usually appears only as a predicate adjective: an unwritten rule that made evening dress <I><FONT color=brown>de rigueur</FONT></I> for attending her soirées.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Inevitable">INEVITABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Require">REQUIRE</A>, <A href="entry://Sure">SURE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lenient">LENIENT</A>, optional, unnecessary.</P>

<P>These words refer to a person who is afflicted with unwarranted self-admiration or a feeling of his own superiority. <B><FONT color=blue>Conceited</FONT></B> pertains to an excessive affection for oneself that may be revealed by an uncritical smugness and aloofness from others: <I><FONT color=brown>conceited</FONT></I> girls who walk home from school with their noses in the air. More specifically, the word may point to a person who becomes well-headed because of a particular accomplishment or occurrence, often a trivial one: She became unbearably <I><FONT color=brown>conceited</FONT></I> after the football captain asked her out. <B><FONT color=blue>Vain</FONT></B> suggests a person who is extremely concerned about his personal appearance or the impression he makes on others. A <I><FONT color=brown>conceited</FONT></I> person might feel that his superiority is self-evident, whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>vain</FONT></I> person would more likely strive constantly to impress others or improve his appearance: The typical dandy of old was so <I><FONT color=brown>vain</FONT></I> about his appearance that he spent almost as much time primping before a mirror as his female counterpart.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Egotistical</FONT></B> need not suggest an outward show, like <I><FONT color=brown>vain</FONT></I>, so much as an extreme self-preoccupation and lack of interest in the feelings or affairs of others. On the other hand, where <I><FONT color=brown>conceited</FONT></I> usually suggests that someone is self-admiring for clearly defined reasons, however specious, <I><FONT color=brown>egotistical</FONT></I> may suggest a more unconscious, narcissistic habit of mind: an <I><FONT color=brown>egotistical</FONT></I> snob who thought the world began and ended where he lived. Sometimes, however, the word can point to the habit of calling attention to oneself and one’s accomplishments, while ignoring the interests of others: the <I><FONT color=brown>egotistical</FONT></I> artist who monopolized the conversation with talk of his work in progress.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Boastful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vainglorious</FONT></B> concentrate on this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>egotistical</FONT></I>, both referring to self-praise and attention-seeking in public. <I><FONT color=brown>Boastful</FONT></I> emphasizes unsubtle and even boorish public displays of vocal self-approval: after a few drinks, he always became <I><FONT color=brown>boastful</FONT></I> about his wartime activities. <I><FONT color=brown>Vainglorious</FONT></I> focuses more exclusively on hollow show, <I><FONT color=brown>boastful</FONT></I> self-praise, but conspicuous displays of status symbols are often involves: <I><FONT color=brown>vainglorious</FONT></I> dowagers dripping minks and diamonds.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Proud</FONT></B> can, of cause, indicate legitimate satisfaction at accomplishing a goal or honour: <I><FONT color=brown>proud</FONT></I> of his high marks in the examination. It can also apply to things invested with real dignity: a <I><FONT color=brown>proud</FONT></I> history; <I><FONT color=brown>proud</FONT></I> mountains silhouetted in the sunset.

<P>These words are concerned with those moments in a sequence of events that are crucial to bringing about a given result. <B><FONT color=blue>Conclusive</FONT></B> suggests a final act that settles questions at issue in a previous course of action: the atomic-bombing of Hiroshima as the <I><FONT color=brown>conclusive</FONT></I> event of World War II. The word may be used in another sense to refer, not to the events themselves, but to a later analysis of them. In this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>conclusive</FONT></I> refers to an incontrovertible interpretation of these events as a whole: <I><FONT color=brown>conclusive</FONT></I> proof that Richard II was not the villain Shakespeare made him out to be. A <B><FONT color=blue>decisive</FONT></B> event differs from a <I><FONT color=brown>conclusive</FONT></I> event in that it need not necessarily be the last one in a given sequence. Indeed, it may be a situation present almost at the outset, with the whole following course of action merely corroborating it. [The enemy’s lack of inspired leadership was <I><FONT color=brown>decisive</FONT></I> to its defeat, long before a single shot was fired.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Determining</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>decisive</FONT></I>, may refer to something that comes early or late in a course of action. <I><FONT color=brown>Decisive</FONT></I> may be more suitable in describe underlying factors that are inherent in a situation and prejudice the outcome. [No matter how many <I><FONT color=brown>decisive</FONT></I> victories Justinian won, the split of East and West into two alien cultures was the <I><FONT color=brown>determining</FONT></I> factor in his ultimate failure to re-unite the Roman Empire.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Definitive</FONT></B>, when referring to an act, combines the meanings of both <I><FONT color=brown>conclusive</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>decisive</FONT></I>. It applies when a sequence of events has been in doubt until the very last act, which irrevocably settles things: Elizabeth’s <I><FONT color=brown>definitive</FONT></I> victory over the Armada settled the question of British naval superiority for centuries. When the word refers to a later analysis of event, it takes in all that is implied by <I><FONT color=brown>conclusive</FONT></I> in this sense, but adds to it implications of authoritative accuracy and incontestable interpretation not to be surpassed. In this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>definitive</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>conclusive</FONT></I>, need not suggest the settling of controversy or the proposing of any thesis whatsoever; it simply suggests finality of examination and analysis: the <I><FONT color=brown>definitive</FONT></I> history of the Boer War; the <I><FONT color=brown>definitive</FONT></I> biography of Byron that strips away all myth and conjecture to show us the actual man as he was.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Final">FINAL</A>, <A href="entry://Outstanding">OUTSTANDING</A>, <A href="entry://Significant">SIGNIFICANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: inconclusive, indeterminate, <A href="entry://Provisional">PROVISIONAL</A>, tentative.</P>

<P>These words refer to the treating of another person as one’s inferior. <B><FONT color=blue>Condescend</FONT></B> suggests particularly the awareness of a social or class distinction, false or real, which one person bridges in dealing or speaking to someone beneath him. The person who <I><FONT color=brown>condescends</FONT></I>, however, calls attention to the difference and does not wish it forgotten. Once, this word was simply descriptive: Her Highness <I><FONT color=brown>condescends</FONT></I> to recognize the foreign ambassador. Nowadays, in our egalitarian world, the word has an almost exclusively negative implication: tourists who <I><FONT color=brown>condescend</FONT></I> to the "natives." <B><FONT color=blue>Deign</FONT></B> emphasizes choice; it implies that one could very well have chosen an opposite, perhaps more appropriate, course. It is not necessarily restricted solely to dealing with one’s inferiors: He didn’t <I><FONT color=brown>deign</FONT></I> to reply to his colleague’s accusation. The word’s extreme formality limits its use today, except for satirical effect: the salesgirl who actually <I><FONT color=brown>deigned</FONT></I> to wait on me.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stoop</FONT></B> was earlier like <I><FONT color=brown>condescend</FONT></I> in emphasizing social station and like <I><FONT color=brown>deign</FONT></I> in suggesting choice; but it now has uses mostly relating to a discreditable moral act: statesmen who <I><FONT color=brown>stoop</FONT></I> to exchanging political favours. <I><FONT color=brown>Condescend</FONT></I> might suggest a generally grand, arch or pompous behavior; <I><FONT color=brown>stoop</FONT></I> suggests single questionable acts. <B><FONT color=blue>Unbend</FONT></B> is more like <I><FONT color=brown>condescend</FONT></I> on this score, but its overtone is one of approval for a stuffy person who learns to relax or act less officiously. [Why does she have to <I><FONT color=brown>condescend</FONT></I> to me all the time? Can’t she <I><FONT color=brown>unbend</FONT></I> a little and treat me like anyone else?]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Patronize</FONT></B>, even more than <I><FONT color=brown>condescend</FONT></I>, suggests haughtiness of bearing and an overtone of looking down on someone: a teacher who <I><FONT color=brown>patronized</FONT></I> his students by oversimplifying everything he taught them. <B><FONT color=blue>Tolerate</FONT></B>, in this context, has gone through several changes in usage. It has meant and can still mean simply to accept; society women who will <I><FONT color=brown>tolerate</FONT></I> eccentric guests so long as they are artists. The word at one point took on a note of reconciliation: learning to <I><FONT color=brown>tolerate</FONT></I> minority groups. Now this last use is avoided as resembling <I><FONT color=brown>patronize</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>condescend</FONT></I> too closely: Aboriginess who wish to be accepted, not merely <I><FONT color=brown>tolerated</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Overbearing">OVERBEARING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: accept, respect, <A href="entry://Revere">REVERE</A>.</P>

<P>These words can refer to the whole pattern or ordering of something, its make-up or constitution, or its enclosing surfaces. <B><FONT color=blue>Form</FONT></B> is the most general of these, applying in all these ways: the sonnet <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I>; ice is water in solid <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I>; rectangular in <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I>. At one extreme, it can merely indicate external appearance: a form-fitting dress. At the other, it can contrast with content all the interrelated patterns and techniques that make of something an organic unity: The author’s keen sense of <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I> sustains him through a subject that could easily have gone awry.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shape</FONT></B> more readily suggests a three-dimensional bulk, but it is not restricted to this reference: the gnarled <I><FONT color=brown>shapes</FONT></I> of century-old cypresses. The word can also apply to the enclosing surfaces of both a plane or solid object: an elliptical <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I>; a dress to show off her lovely <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I>. When form and <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I> are contrasted, <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I> usually suggests a prescribed or typical pattern, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I> suggests the individual interrelationships that a specific thing exhibits: the startling variety of <I><FONT color=brown>shapes</FONT></I> with which the sculptor had fleshed out the human and animal <I><FONT color=brown>forms</FONT></I> he had chosen as his subjects.</P><P>When <B><FONT color=blue>outline</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>contour</FONT></B> are contrasted, <I><FONT color=brown>outline</FONT></I> may apply to the bounding edges of a plane figure, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>contour</FONT></I> pertains exclusively to the enclosing surface of a solid figure: a star-shaped <I><FONT color=brown>outline</FONT></I>; the graceful <I><FONT color=brown>contours</FONT></I> of a pear. <I><FONT color=brown>Outline</FONT></I>, however, can refer more generally to the containing perimeter of any <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I>, plane or solid; in the latter case, it suggests one of a solid’s possible silhouettes: the jutting <I><FONT color=brown>outline</FONT></I> of his chin in profile.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Figure</FONT></B> refers in plane geometry to any form enclosed by three or more lines: A trapezoid is a <I><FONT color=brown>figure</FONT></I> bounded by four lines. In other uses, the word may suggest something reduced to its diagrammatic essential, or to the characteristic form or set of <I><FONT color=brown>outlines</FONT></I> by which something is recognizable: eyes peeled for the familiar hunched <I><FONT color=brown>figure</FONT></I> of an apple tree that marked the right path to the farmhouse. At the same time, however, the word can refer to the details that fill out and give body to a <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I>: a slow movement memorable for a complex pizzicato <I><FONT color=brown>figure</FONT></I> that recurs in the violins. Like <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I>, the word can refer to the human body, but with a greater emphasis on the total impression made by the relationship of part to part: a trim, clean-cut <I><FONT color=brown>figure</FONT></I>; He cut an imposing <I><FONT color=brown>figure</FONT></I> in his new dinner suit. <B><FONT color=blue>Configuration</FONT></B> can refer like <I><FONT color=brown>contour</FONT></I> to the <I><FONT color=brown>outlines</FONT></I> of a solid <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I>, but whereas <I><FONT color=brown>contour</FONT></I> can sometimes suggest gentle or smooth undulations, <I><FONT color=brown>configuration</FONT></I> can apply to any sort of <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I>; it is particularly relevant to landscape: a house designed by the architect to exploit and fit into the dramatic <I><FONT color=brown>configuration</FONT></I> of the cliff. In more general uses, <I><FONT color=brown>configuration</FONT></I> suggests the exact disposition of all the observable details within a <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I>, as well as its external <I><FONT color=brown>outlines</FONT></I>: the lacework <I><FONT color=brown>configurations</FONT></I> of a snowflake; a <I><FONT color=brown>configuration</FONT></I> of jagged <I><FONT color=brown>shapes</FONT></I> within the symmetrical <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I> of each inkblot.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Structure</FONT></B> concentrates on the disposition of details suggested by one use of <I><FONT color=brown>configuration</FONT></I>. But <I><FONT color=brown>structure</FONT></I> may refer in addition to an underlying form that is not necessarily observable by a glance at the outlines of something: excessive fat disguising what was basically a perfectly formed bone <I><FONT color=brown>structure</FONT></I>. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>structure</FONT></I> emphasizes the organic interrelatedness of a whole, seen from the perspective of function: the complicated <I><FONT color=brown>structure</FONT></I> of the executive branch of the government; the <I><FONT color=brown>structure</FONT></I> of the petrol engine. <B><FONT color=blue>Gestalt</FONT></B> is the most inclusive of these words in pointing to the totality of details that go to make up a moment of experience, referring to all those factors that impinge on a single psychological state. The word is drawn from <I><FONT color=brown>gestalt</FONT></I> psychology, which theorizes that the unity of such a totality is greater than the sum of its parts. The word has since been applied more generally to anything that can be said to have organic structure: Each of the scenes in the novel contributed to an overall <I><FONT color=brown>gestalt</FONT></I> of guilt and redemption.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boundary">BOUNDARY</A>, <A href="entry://Circumscribe">CIRCUMSCRIBE</A>, <A href="entry://Physical">PHYSICAL</A>, <A href="entry://Prototype">PROTOTYPE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: content, formlessness, shapelessness.</P>

confine
<B><FONT color=blue>confine</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gaol</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>imprison</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>incarcerate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>intern</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the shutting up, usually of people, in a particular place. <B><FONT color=blue>Confine</FONT></B> is the most general of these and indicates a reduction of mobility for whatever reason: He felt <I><FONT color=brown>confined</FONT></I> and claustrophobic in a big city; <I><FONT color=brown>confined</FONT></I> by ill-health to her bed. More pertinent to this context, the word suggests removing someone to a prison or mental hospital, usually against the person’s will: a sentence <I><FONT color=brown>confining</FONT></I> him to life imprisonment; a court order <I><FONT color=brown>confining</FONT></I> him indefinitely to an institution for the criminally insane. From one sense of being kept in bed, <I><FONT color=brown>confine</FONT></I> is used (usually in the passive voice) to mean being brought to bed pending the birth of a child: She was <I><FONT color=brown>confined</FONT></I> in the local hospital, awaiting her fifth baby.</P><P>The directness and informality of <B><FONT color=blue>gaol</FONT></B> makes <I><FONT color=brown>confine</FONT></I> sound euphemistic by comparison when it refers to shutting someone up in prison: <I><FONT color=brown>gaoled</FONT></I> on a disorderly-conduct charge. Although identical in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>gaol</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>imprison</FONT></B> gives more formal tone without sounding euphemistic like <I><FONT color=brown>confine</FONT></I>: a régime that <I><FONT color=brown>imprisoned</FONT></I> anyone suspected of dissent. The one possible difference between <I><FONT color=brown>gaol</FONT></I> and impr<I><FONT color=brown>i</FONT></I>son is that <I><FONT color=brown>gaol</FONT></I> might be used for a relatively short stay: <I><FONT color=brown>gaoled</FONT></I> overnight because he had trouble raising bail; <I><FONT color=brown>imprisoned</FONT></I> for ten years in the Bastille. <B><FONT color=blue>Incarcerate</FONT></B> is the most formal of all these words; while close in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>imprison</FONT></I>, it may suggest the initial act of <I><FONT color=brown>imprisoning</FONT></I>: He was <I><FONT color=brown>incarcerated</FONT></I> in the local <I><FONT color=brown>gaol</FONT></I> pending transfer to a maximum-security prison. <I><FONT color=brown>Incarcerated</FONT></I> is sometimes used to suggest a harsh, punitive or brutal <I><FONT color=brown>imprisoning</FONT></I> under inhumane conditions: They <I><FONT color=brown>incarcerated</FONT></I> him in a windowless basement cell. The word, furthermore, can refer like <I><FONT color=brown>confine</FONT></I> to the shutting up of the mentally ill; here the emphasis may be on inhumane treatment: The family <I><FONT color=brown>incarcerated</FONT></I> the wretch in a concealed, airless room in the attic.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intern</FONT></B> is unique among this group, in pertaining to the impounding of people or even equipment, as during war: the policy of <I><FONT color=brown>interning</FONT></I> citizens of German origin during World War II. The word, furthermore, contrasts sharply with the punitive possibilities of <I><FONT color=brown>gaol</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>imprison</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>incarcerate</FONT></I>, in that the <I><FONT color=brown>interning</FONT></I> can conceivably be done for the internee’s own good: They <I><FONT color=brown>interned</FONT></I> the demonstrators to protect them from the fury of the mob.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Circumscribe">CIRCUMSCRIBE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: emancipate, free, liberate, release.</P>

<P>These words refer to a disordered emotional response to complex or puzzling experiences or events. <B><FONT color=blue>Confuse</FONT></B> is the most general of these and suggests the mildest disorientation: detailed directions that only served to <I><FONT color=brown>confuse</FONT></I> me further; <I><FONT color=brown>confused</FONT></I> by his sudden pendulum swings between exuberance and depression. The word may suggest only a temporary lack of equilibrium or resilience. <B><FONT color=blue>Bewilder</FONT></B> deepens the suggestions of <I><FONT color=brown>confuse</FONT></I> and adds a note of harried emotional discomfort: completely <I><FONT color=brown>bewildered</FONT></I> by the crossfire of conflicting commands shouted at him by his parents. The word suggests a disorientation that is longer lasting than <I><FONT color=brown>confuse</FONT></I> and that may paralyse one’s ability to choose or act coherently: She was so <I><FONT color=brown>bewildered</FONT></I> by his accusations that she sat down and cried. <B><FONT color=blue>Confound</FONT></B> suggests a complete and possibly intentional undoing of someone by contravening them at every point or by exposing them to unfriendly scrutiny or ridicule: an appeal for help that was utterly <I><FONT color=brown>confounded</FONT></I> by red tape and bureaucratic double talk.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dumbfound</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>nonplus</FONT></B> are closely related, both suggesting a momentary astonishment at some sudden occurrence or sharp retort. <I><FONT color=brown>Dumbfound</FONT></I> implies an acute emotional shock that leaves one speechless; <I><FONT color=brown>nonplus</FONT></I> suggests a more intellectual surprise at some irrational incongruence, leaving one unable to think clearly for a moment: He was <I><FONT color=brown>dumbfounded</FONT></I> at her insistence that he explain where every cent of his allowance had gone; <I><FONT color=brown>nonplused</FONT></I> by the strange costumes he saw everywhere in the bohemian section of the city.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Doubt">DOUBT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clarify">CLARIFY</A>, <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>, hearten, <A href="entry://Help">HELP</A>, reassure.</P>

<P>These verbs apply to things that are brought or fastened together. <B><FONT color=blue>Connect</FONT></B> is used of things that come into contact at some point while clearly remaining separate. Things may be directly <I><FONT color=brown>connected</FONT></I> or, as is often the case, <I><FONT color=brown>connected</FONT></I> by some intervening means or agency: <I><FONT color=brown>connecting</FONT></I> rooms in a hotel, with a bath between them; two large land masses <I><FONT color=brown>connected</FONT></I> by an isthmus. <I><FONT color=brown>Connect</FONT></I> also may suggest a contact that results in the transfer of power from a source to a receiver. One <I><FONT color=brown>connects</FONT></I> a radio by inserting its plug into an electrical outlet. A switchboard operator can <I><FONT color=brown>connect</FONT></I> two people over the telephone by connecting the proper electric circuits. A boxer who hits his opponent solidly is said to <I><FONT color=brown>connect</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Attach</FONT></B> is applied to things that are or that may be connected securely but that retain their separate identities and are separable. <I><FONT color=brown>Attaching</FONT></I> implies the fastening on of a part to a whole, of a lesser thing to a greater, or of something movable to something fixed. Hence one may <I><FONT color=brown>attach</FONT></I> a flash-gun to a camera, a pin to a dress, or a fire-hose to a hydrant. A barnacle attaches itself to a ship. A door is <I><FONT color=brown>attached</FONT></I> to the doorpost by hinges. Applied to persons, <I><FONT color=brown>connect</FONT></I> may suggest an indefinite relationship, while attach may imply a specific but temporary association. [He is <I><FONT color=brown>connected</FONT></I> with the government in some capacity; An attaché is a person officially <I><FONT color=brown>attached</FONT></I> to a diplomatic mission.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Link</FONT></B> suggests a connection like that of loops in a chain. When things brought directly together are <I><FONT color=brown>linked</FONT></I>, they are interlocked: to <I><FONT color=brown>link</FONT></I> arms. But things not in contact may also be <I><FONT color=brown>linked</FONT></I> by something that forms a bond between them. A <I><FONT color=brown>linking</FONT></I> verb is one that serves to <I><FONT color=brown>connect</FONT></I> the subject of a sentence with the predicate. <I><FONT color=brown>Link</FONT></I> may also mean to find or point out a connection between things: to <I><FONT color=brown>link</FONT></I> cigarette smoking to cancer. <B><FONT color=blue>Couple</FONT></B> stresses pairing. To <I><FONT color=brown>couple</FONT></I> is to connect two things, often by means of a <I><FONT color=brown>linking</FONT></I> device: to couple railway vans. To <I><FONT color=brown>couple</FONT></I> electric circuits is to <I><FONT color=brown>connect</FONT></I> them magnetically or directly, permitting transfer or power from one to the other.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Join</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unite</FONT></B> are applied to things that come together closely or combine. <I><FONT color=brown>Join</FONT></I> stresses the previous, and possibly the future, separateness of the parts, while <I><FONT color=brown>unite</FONT></I> emphasizes the new whole that is formed. Two or more things may <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> through mutual action or adjacent location, or may be <I><FONT color=brown>joined</FONT></I> by being fitted or linked together. [The two groups <I><FONT color=brown>joined</FONT></I> forces against a common enemy; <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> hands and form a circle.] Also, a lesser thing may <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> a greater or a single person may <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> a group, each becoming a part of the whole: to <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> a club. [<I><FONT color=brown>Join</FONT></I> us at our table; The Murrumbidgee and the Darling rivers <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> the Murray.] To <I><FONT color=brown>unite</FONT></I> is to <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> together so as to form one integral whole. Two or more things that <I><FONT color=brown>unite</FONT></I> give up all or part of their separateness in order to exist or act as one: to <I><FONT color=brown>unite</FONT></I> two ingredients in a mixture or compound; The states <I><FONT color=brown>united</FONT></I> to form a nation.</P><P>All these words can be applied to inter-personal relationships. <I><FONT color=brown>Attach</FONT></I> suggests personal ties of affection: He grew <I><FONT color=brown>attached</FONT></I> to her. <I><FONT color=brown>Link</FONT></I> can imply a coupling: Their names were <I><FONT color=brown>linked</FONT></I> in the gossip columns. <I><FONT color=brown>Couple</FONT></I> can mean to copulate. <I><FONT color=brown>Join</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>unite</FONT></I> are applied to marriage, while connect indicates a looser, much less intimate association: to <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> a man and a woman in holy matrimony. [They were <I><FONT color=brown>united</FONT></I> in marriage; Their families are now <I><FONT color=brown>connected</FONT></I> by marriage.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adapt">ADAPT</A>, <A href="entry://Add">ADD</A>, <A href="entry://Component">COMPONENT</A>, <A href="entry://Mixture">MIXTURE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: alienate, dissociate, <A href="entry://Shake">SEPARATE</A>, <A href="entry://Sever">SEVER</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a positive response or to a congruence between or among things. <B><FONT color=blue>Consent</FONT></B> is restricted to the giving of permission or the accepting of a proposal or request. [The adjutant <I><FONT color=brown>consented</FONT></I> to the corporal’s request for emergency leave; She <I><FONT color=brown>consented</FONT></I> to his proposal of marriage.] <I><FONT color=brown>Consent</FONT></I> always implies the power not to <I><FONT color=brown>consent</FONT></I>: The king gave willing <I><FONT color=brown>consent</FONT></I> to his son’s marriage to a princess, and reluctant <I><FONT color=brown>consent</FONT></I> to his daughter’s marriage to a commoner. Where <I><FONT color=brown>consent</FONT></I> often implies the permission of a superior, <B><FONT color=blue>assent</FONT></B> can indicate the approval of an equal. The word, furthermore, is most often limited to an affirmative response to a statement or opinion: She <I><FONT color=brown>assented</FONT></I> to the doctor’s assertion that her son was ill, but would not <I><FONT color=brown>consent</FONT></I> to having him hospitalized. <B><FONT color=blue>Acquiesce</FONT></B> suggests either lukewarm or minimal compliance or a compliance compelled by outside force or circumstances: With a shrug, she <I><FONT color=brown>acquiesced</FONT></I> in his proposal that they go to the football game together; a spontaneous uprising that forced the government to <I><FONT color=brown>acquiesce</FONT></I> to the demands of its citizens. In the latter case, the word does not suggest the uncompromised freedom to choose that is inherent in the previous words.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agree</FONT></B> is much wider in its application than the previous words. It can apply, like <I><FONT color=brown>consent</FONT></I>, to a positive responds: after hearing his prepared statement, many on the committee <I><FONT color=brown>agree</FONT></I> with his stand. But the word can also indicate congruence of opinion that does not involve statement and response, or even previous negotiation or discussion: I met the new manager today and found that we <I><FONT color=brown>agree</FONT></I> on basic policies. In its widest use, the word can indicate things that are alike: Both husband and wife were surprised to find that the balances in their separate chequebooks <I><FONT color=brown>agreed</FONT></I> to the cent. <B><FONT color=blue>Concur</FONT></B> is restricted to statements, findings or opinions, but otherwise can indicate, like <I><FONT color=brown>agree</FONT></I>, positions that are found to be alike: The two scientists, working separately and unknown to each other, had reached conclusions that <I><FONT color=brown>concurred</FONT></I>. More often, however, the word refers to a common position reached by serious deliberation or negotiation: Each member of the committee finally <I><FONT color=brown>concurred</FONT></I> as to what position they should take on the controversial matter. The word can also indicate <I><FONT color=brown>agreeing</FONT></I> to a position already taken by another or other: One Supreme Court judge wrote a separate but <I><FONT color=brown>concurring</FONT></I> opinion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Subscribe</FONT></B> indicates wholehearted approval for an already formulated position. The word’s root suggests the signing of one’s name beneath a statement; the word may sometimes suggest this situation, but much more often it indicates only a comparable willingness to support and defend a position: A public-opinion poll proved that the voters <I><FONT color=brown>subscribed</FONT></I> to the government’s policy. Sometimes the notion of a public avowal is completely absent: They <I><FONT color=brown>subscribed</FONT></I> in secret to discriminatory employment practices.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Approval">APPROVAL</A>, <A href="entry://Coincide">COINCIDE</A>, <A href="entry://Endorse">ENDORSE</A>, submit.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Contradict">CONTRADICT</A>, <A href="entry://Demur">DEMUR</A>, <A href="entry://Disagree">DISAGREE</A>.</P>

<P>These words are concerned with attempts to keep something intact or to possess it in greater quantities. <B><FONT color=blue>Conserve</FONT></B> pertains to the wise use of a valuable item that one already has, with the suggestion that it will be difficult to replace once it has been used up; leaflets requesting citizens to <I><FONT color=brown>conserve</FONT></I> water during the growth; efforts to <I><FONT color=brown>conserve</FONT></I> forest land from the incursions of timber speculators. <B><FONT color=blue>Preserve</FONT></B>, on the other hand, emphasizes keeping something that is valuable exactly as it is, without change and, in some cases, even without using it at all. It suggests greater urgency and, in contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>conserve</FONT></I>, may suggest that the item in question is literally impossible to replace, once it is gone: proposals to <I><FONT color=brown>preserve</FONT></I> the house as it was when Poe lived in it; He was in favour of <I><FONT color=brown>preserving</FONT></I> the area as a wild life sanctuary.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Maintain</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>save</FONT></B> relate somewhat like <I><FONT color=brown>conserve</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>preserve</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Maintain</FONT></I> emphasizes careful use and replenishment of a quantity, like <I><FONT color=brown>conserve</FONT></I>, but it suggests that a steady routine of work will be enough to keep the item in its present state. <I><FONT color=brown>Maintain</FONT></I>, also, does not necessarily suggest something of great value; it can pertain to anything one wishes to keep in good working condition: We can <I><FONT color=brown>maintain</FONT></I> essential services by ensuring a steady flow of revenue; <I><FONT color=brown>maintaining</FONT></I> a house in good condition by an almost predictable annual outlay of time, effort and money. <I><FONT color=brown>Save</FONT></I>, on the other hand, is somewhat more like <I><FONT color=brown>preserve</FONT></I>, suggesting greater urgency and the irreplaceability of what might otherwise be lost. If anything, it is more urgent (and certainly more informal) than <I><FONT color=brown>preserve</FONT></I>, especially in its sense of rescue: action that narrowly <I><FONT color=brown>saved</FONT></I> the country from defeat. In an informal context, however, it can function exactly like the more formal conserve: <I><FONT color=brown>saving</FONT></I> water during the crisis. Where it is distinct from all the words so far discussed is in suggesting the accumulating of a quantity. Both <I><FONT color=brown>conserve</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>preserve</FONT></I> concentrate on what one already has; <I><FONT color=brown>maintain</FONT></I> emphasizes the taking in and giving out to keep an unchanging balance. <I><FONT color=brown>Save</FONT></I>, however, can suggest the adding of new quantities to what already exists: He was <I><FONT color=brown>saving</FONT></I> up money for a university education; As she grew older she took to <I><FONT color=brown>saving</FONT></I> bits of string she found in the street.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Store</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>hoard</FONT></B> relate to this last meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>save</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Store</FONT></I> suggests the piling up of goods that may be bulkier than those suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>save</FONT></I>; but, as with <I><FONT color=brown>save</FONT></I>, the <I><FONT color=brown>stored</FONT></I> item may be valuable or worthless, may be <I><FONT color=brown>stored</FONT></I> for future use ?or for no purpose whatsoever: reservoirs in which to <I><FONT color=brown>store</FONT></I> water against periods of slight rainfall; <I><FONT color=brown>storing</FONT></I> his books with friends until he returned from Europe; She <I><FONT color=brown>stored</FONT></I> every flotsam relic of her life without ever looking at it again. <I><FONT color=brown>Hoard</FONT></I> gives an unpleasant picture of someone saving or storing valuables out of fear, greed or mental derangement: Everyone <I><FONT color=brown>hoarded</FONT></I> food during the famine; <I><FONT color=brown>hoarding</FONT></I> his money while living like a beggar.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Possess">POSSESS</A>, <A href="entry://Recover">RECOVER</A>, <A href="entry://Repair">REPAIR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: disperse, dissipate, scatter, spend, squander, waste.</P>

<P>These words refer to a belief that something is the case. <B><FONT color=blue>Consider</FONT></B> can indicate a belief reached after thoughtful deliberation or intimate experience. [All the critics <I><FONT color=brown>considered</FONT></I> the book a masterpiece; Most of the soldiers <I><FONT color=brown>considered</FONT></I> the guerilla force to be a formidable opponent.] A favourable verdict is not always necessary: Scientists of that day <I><FONT color=brown>considered</FONT></I> his experiments to be without merit. <B><FONT color=blue>Regard</FONT></B> comes from a French word meaning to look at. Compared with <I><FONT color=brown>consider</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I> often reflects its derivation by suggesting a more external assessment or, sometimes, a visual one: He <I><FONT color=brown>regarded</FONT></I> his wife as a beauty, though others found her plain. Again, a positive judgement is not inevitable, despite the word’s related use referring to approval: They <I><FONT color=brown>regarded</FONT></I> him as a harmless fool.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Count</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>reckon</FONT></B> literally to numbering or to figuring sums; in the present context, they seldom carry this sense over, though they do refer to the forming of a judgement. Here, <I><FONT color=brown>count</FONT></I> is most often restricted to stock phrases: <I><FONT color=brown>counting</FONT></I> himself lucky; <I><FONT color=brown>counting</FONT></I> the day well spent. <I><FONT color=brown>Reckon</FONT></I> suggests the weighing of evidence on all sides: He was <I><FONT color=brown>reckoned</FONT></I> by everyone to be an honest man. But the word has lost ground to its informal or dialect use, meaning to suppose or guess: I <I><FONT color=brown>reckon</FONT></I> it’s time to go. This use has been popularized by Western movies and television programs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deem</FONT></B> is now somewhat formal and occurs perhaps more often in legal contexts than in other contexts. It refers more to opinion than belief, but to opinion arrived at after deliberation; if the opinion is that of a judge it may well be as firm or binding as the belief implied by consider and regard: The judge <I><FONT color=brown>deemed</FONT></I> it inadvisable to hear the appeal. <I><FONT color=brown>Deem</FONT></I> almost always carries with it a note of authority: He was <I><FONT color=brown>deemed</FONT></I> a traitor by his own people.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Study">STUDY</A>, <A href="entry://Think">THINK</A>.</P>

<P>These adjectives describe persons or actions that show a kind or courteous concern for other people. <B><FONT color=blue>Considerate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>thoughtful</FONT></B> emphasize the unselfish spirit behind the act, the generous thought that prompts the deed. A <I><FONT color=brown>considerate</FONT></I> person is mindful of other people’s feelings, aware of their circumstances, and responsive to their needs. He considers consequences before he acts, feeling that he should spare others needless annoyance, difficulty or distress. A <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtful</FONT></I> person is <I><FONT color=brown>considerate</FONT></I>, but in a more positive way, having an active regard for others that leads him to anticipate their needs. He thinks of benefits he might bestow and then he acts, hoping to help others or to please them: <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtful</FONT></I> friends who offer to buy groceries for a sick neighbour; <I><FONT color=brown>considerate</FONT></I> people who try not to disturb a convalescent with their noise. Both <I><FONT color=brown>considerate</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtful</FONT></I> are often followed by <I><FONT color=brown>of</FONT></I> plus an object. [He is <I><FONT color=brown>considerate of</FONT></I> older people; It was <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtful of</FONT></I> you to remember my birthday.] Thoughtful is also used for its connotations to describe a welcome remembrance: a very <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtful</FONT></I> gift.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Attentive</FONT></B> emphasizes constant acts of courtesy, indicating an apparent thoughtfulness or devotion that may or may not be real. An <I><FONT color=brown>attentive</FONT></I> escort opens doors for his partner, offers her his arm, helps her with her coat, lights her cigarette. But he may be either gentleman or gigolo, either genuinely <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtful</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>considerate</FONT></I> or anxious to seem so for selfish reasons. [She was <I><FONT color=brown>attentive</FONT></I> to her sick sister, whom she loved; He became very <I><FONT color=brown>attentive</FONT></I> to his aunt when he learned the old lady was rich.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tactful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>diplomatic</FONT></B> emphasize method, an ability to handle sensitive people and situations gracefully without causing hurt or angry feelings. A <I><FONT color=brown>tactful</FONT></I> person is <I><FONT color=brown>considerate</FONT></I> of others and is careful not to embarrass, upset or offend them. He senses instinctively what to say and what to leave unsaid, often practising restraint or taking a round-about approach in order to be kind: a <I><FONT color=brown>tactful</FONT></I> suggestion that another hair style might be more becoming; He know it was a sore subject, and being <I><FONT color=brown>tactful</FONT></I>, he did not bring it up. <I><FONT color=brown>Diplomatic</FONT></I> is a more formal term than <I><FONT color=brown>tactful</FONT></I> and suggests a deliberate rather than an intuitive courtesy. It presupposes the special tact required of a diplomat ?skill in handling delicate or explosive situations, in mediating disputes, and in resolving differences through conciliation and compromise: a situation that requires <I><FONT color=brown>diplomatic</FONT></I> handling, not angry ultimatums.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Benevolence">BENEVOLENCE</A>, <A href="entry://Generous">GENEROUS</A>, <A href="entry://Humane">HUMANE</A>, <A href="entry://Kind">KIND</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Gauche">GAUCHE</A>, <A href="entry://Heedless">HEEDLESS</A>, inattentive, negligent.</P>

<P>These words refer to the assuaging of unhappiness or grief. <B><FONT color=blue>Console</FONT></B> suggests the effort of one person to mitigate the serious grief felt by another: on hand to <I><FONT color=brown>console</FONT></I> him through the whole of his mourning. The word may specifically suggest the attempt to make up for a loss by offering something in its place: They tried to <I><FONT color=brown>console</FONT></I> him for losing the prize by taking him to a theatre. This making up for a loss may occur within the loser’s mind: She was <I><FONT color=brown>consoled</FONT></I> to think that she at least had an understanding husband to turn to. <B><FONT color=blue>Condole</FONT></B> is almost obsolete but, when used, is a great deal more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>console</FONT></I>, almost to the point of sounding fusty and pompous; it does give the specific meaning of actively grieving with someone else: parents who <I><FONT color=brown>condoled</FONT></I> with each other over the loss of their child. The word is now most used in the noun form, <I><FONT color=brown>condolence</FONT></I>, for formal expressions of regret.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Comfort</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cheer up</FONT></B> are less formal than <I><FONT color=brown>condole</FONT></I> and even than <I><FONT color=brown>console</FONT></I>; they also can apply to less serious unhappiness. <I><FONT color=brown>Comfort</FONT></I>, of the two, has the wider range of use, it suggest a tactful and understanding ministering to someone who is unhappy: She <I><FONT color=brown>comforted</FONT></I> the grieving child with a tight embrace. This word can also refer to thoughts within the mourner’s mind that mitigate grief: <I><FONT color=brown>comforted</FONT></I> to know that everything had been carried out exactly as his friend would have wished. <I><FONT color=brown>Cheer up</FONT></I> is decidedly limited to active attempts to ease someone’s mind over a less extreme unhappiness: She knew that if he failed to get the job she would have to exert every wile she possessed in order to <I><FONT color=brown>cheer</FONT></I> him<I><FONT color=brown> up</FONT></I>; a bubbling manner that <I><FONT color=brown>cheered up</FONT></I> the most despondent men in the ward.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Solace</FONT></B> is very formal and might sound precious as a substitute for the more direct <I><FONT color=brown>comfort</FONT></I>; the word can suggest a tender intensity of fellow-feeling: The chaplain’s attempts to <I><FONT color=brown>solace</FONT></I> the wounded and dying during the battle. <B><FONT color=blue>Sympathize</FONT></B> in this context suggests an understanding and attentive manner to the needs of the grief-stricken. The word implies a more passive role than these other words: <I><FONT color=brown>sympathizing</FONT></I> silently with the patient’s rambling accounts of his many ills; all those who <I><FONT color=brown>sympathized</FONT></I> with us in our bereavement.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheer">CHEER</A>, <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: aggravate, <A href="entry://Grieve">GRIEVE</A>, <A href="entry://Hurt">HURT</A>, sadden, <A href="entry://Upset">UPSET</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>consult</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>confer</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>negotiate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>parley</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to discussions held to clarify a question or reach an agreement. <B><FONT color=blue>Consult</FONT></B> emphasizes clarification as the motive without necessarily suggesting ultimate agreement: The Prime Minister <I><FONT color=brown>consulted</FONT></I> his Cabinet on a variety of questions. Often the word may suggest the seeking out of an authority: <I><FONT color=brown>Consult</FONT></I> your dictionary when unsure of your spelling. Similarly, the word can suggest the applying of an inferior to a superior: The salesgirl said she would have to <I><FONT color=brown>consult</FONT></I> the supervisor about the matter. Sometimes, the word points to a secret or private discussion: Have you thought of <I><FONT color=brown>consulting</FONT></I> a psychiatrist? <B><FONT color=blue>Confer</FONT></B> also emphasizes clarification more than agreement, but here the notion of inferior and superior is less often present. What is stressed is the exchanging of views: union meetings at which the management could <I><FONT color=brown>confer</FONT></I> with the men about work problems. The word may suggest intimate and informal but not necessarily secret discussion: The coach sat <I><FONT color=brown>conferring</FONT></I> with the trainer.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Negotiate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>parley</FONT></B> are restricted to situations in which the main motive is the attempt to reach agreement between opposing sides or positions. Both words suggest formal meetings. <I><FONT color=brown>Parley</FONT></I> comes from a French word, meaning to speak, and applies to actual enemies attempting or resolve differences through words rather than force: Representatives of the French and English kings <I><FONT color=brown>parleyed</FONT></I> on the battlefield. The word calls to mind the vanished world of warring European kingdoms and is less often used for comparable contemporary situations. The preferred word now is <I><FONT color=brown>negotiate</FONT></I>; it applies to any formal meeting of opposing sides to settle their differences through compromise rather than through force or some other form of direct action or confrontation. [Labour and management finally <I><FONT color=brown>negotiated</FONT></I> a settlement after two weeks of gruelling bargaining, thus averting a strike; The Secretary-General urged both sides to <I><FONT color=brown>negotiate</FONT></I> a settlement to the bloody war.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Advice">ADVICE</A>, <A href="entry://Argue">ARGUE</A>, <A href="entry://Conversation">CONVERSATION</A>, <A href="entry://Inform">INFORM</A>.</P>

<P>These words express the action of coming together with another or others. <B><FONT color=blue>Meet</FONT></B> is the most general word and has the widest range of application. It may mean simply to come upon: He <I><FONT color=brown>met</FONT></I> her there by chance. Or it may indicate a previous appointment: He promised to <I><FONT color=brown>meet</FONT></I> her at the restaurant at noon. In one specific sense, it may mean to go to or be at the place of a traveller’s arrival: They <I><FONT color=brown>met</FONT></I> her at the station, so she didn’t have to get a taxi. In some contexts, <I><FONT color=brown>meet</FONT></I> refers to a formal introduction or to the making of a new acquaintance. [Have you <I><FONT color=brown>met</FONT></I> my mother?; They <I><FONT color=brown>met</FONT></I> a very interesting couple at the beach.] Or it may indicate an assembling, as for a conference. [What time is the committee to <I><FONT color=brown>meet</FONT></I>?] In a restricted, literal sense, <I><FONT color=brown>meet</FONT></I> may stress a face-to-face approach. [He pulled out to pass and <I><FONT color=brown>met</FONT></I> another car head-on; While going to St. Ives, he <I><FONT color=brown>met</FONT></I> a man with seven wives.]</P><P>Of the remaining words, <B><FONT color=blue>encounter</FONT></B> is the closest synonym for meet, but it strongly implies a casual or unexpected <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I>. [He <I><FONT color=brown>encountered</FONT></I> many interesting people on his travels and mentions a few memorable ones in his memoirs; They came sneaking round the corner and <I><FONT color=brown>encountered</FONT></I> a policeman.] <I><FONT color=brown>Encounter</FONT></I> may also mean to <I><FONT color=brown>meet</FONT></I> in conflict or face in battle. [They <I><FONT color=brown>encountered</FONT></I> one another in the boxing ring; We <I><FONT color=brown>encountered</FONT></I> the enemy in various small border clashes.]</P><P>The phrase <B><FONT color=blue>get in touch with</FONT></B> implies the establishing or renewing of communication. It is conversational in tone. [When you are in London, you might <I><FONT color=brown>get in touch with</FONT></I> a friend of mine.] <B><FONT color=blue>Contact</FONT></B> used as a verb meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>get in touch with</FONT></I> is still regarded as informal, although it seems to be gaining more and more acceptance in the written language. <I><FONT color=brown>Get in touch with</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>contact</FONT></I> are both quite useful when the particular means of communication is not indicated. [I haven’t been able to <I><FONT color=brown>get in touch with</FONT></I> him, though I’ve tried writing to him, phoning him and going to his office; We'll <I><FONT color=brown>contact</FONT></I> you later; I will have to <I><FONT color=brown>contact</FONT></I> my solicitor.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>See</FONT></B> in one sense is close to encounter, referring to a chance meeting.] I <I><FONT color=brown>saw</FONT></I> your husband in town the other day.] In a special sense, it refers to the granting of an appointment or interview, or to the reception of guests. [The doctor will <I><FONT color=brown>see</FONT></I> you now; He asked if he might <I><FONT color=brown>see</FONT></I> her again; Madame is ill and is not <I><FONT color=brown>seeing</FONT></I> anyone today.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Meeting">MEETING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Avoid">AVOID</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>contemptible</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>despicable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>detestable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>execrable</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to people, acts or things that are unworthy, immoral or intensely disapproved of because of bad behaviour, bad execution or bad taste. <B><FONT color=blue>Contemptible</FONT></B> indicates that something merits disapproval because it patently falls short of even minimal standards of worth or adequacy. The standard implied here is usually one pertaining to morals or conduct: the candidate’s <I><FONT color=brown>contemptible</FONT></I> appeal to greed and prejudice; her <I><FONT color=brown>contemptible</FONT></I> rudeness to the guest of honour. But it can extend to any evaluating process: The concerto was a <I><FONT color=brown>contemptible</FONT></I> piece of trash. <B><FONT color=blue>Execrable</FONT></B> can apply through a comparably wide range, but in actual use it applies more often to bad taste or conduct than to immoral acts: dressed in execrable taste; an <I><FONT color=brown>execrable</FONT></I> lack of concern for the feelings of others. Because of this distinction, <I><FONT color=brown>contemptible</FONT></I> is the stronger word, even though it suggests something worthy of scorn, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>execrable</FONT></I> suggests something worthy of hearty condemnation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Despicable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>detestable</FONT></B> are both stronger than the preceding pair, pointing to something worthy of hatred or intense revulsion. <I><FONT color=brown>Despicable</FONT></I> can sometimes apply to work or conduct that one finds utterly worthless: a <I><FONT color=brown>despicable</FONT></I> painting; a <I><FONT color=brown>despicable</FONT></I> bore. But these uses shade off, with weakened force, into hyperbole. At its most intense, the word suggests criminals, even the most vicious, are so <I><FONT color=brown>despicable</FONT></I> as those gangsters who traffic in narcotics and prostitution; a <I><FONT color=brown>despicable</FONT></I> dictator who sentenced thousands to prison and death. While <I><FONT color=brown>despicable</FONT></I> can be used less forcefully to register a personal opinion, <I><FONT color=brown>detestable</FONT></I> is more readily used in this way, since it can suggest an extreme aversion rather than moral outrage: he found early Italian opera utterly <I><FONT color=brown>detestable</FONT></I>. Even when its reference is to moral this note of personal distaste may be present: He was amazed that no one else seemed to notice the <I><FONT color=brown>detestable</FONT></I> cruelty with which she treated her children.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Depraved">DEPRAVED</A>, <A href="entry://Reprehensible">REPREHENSIBLE</A>, <A href="entry://Repulsive">REPULSIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: admirable, <A href="entry://Excellent">EXCELLENT</A>, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Contemptuous</FONT></B>, the strongest word in this list, means viewing something or someone as mean, vile or worthless and actively showing or expressing that view. Attributively, <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I> is applied to a person’s words or actions; predicatively it may be used to describe the person. A man may utter a <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I> remark; he may be <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I> of his associates.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scornful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>disdainful</FONT></B> agree in their application to persons feeling or expressing contempt based on pride or a sense of superiority. The expression of contempt is often limited to the dismissal of the object as unworthy of attention. Like <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I>, these words are used attributively with expressions of contempt and predicatively with the person expressing it: a <I><FONT color=brown>scornful</FONT></I> glance; a <I><FONT color=brown>disdainful</FONT></I> rejection; The nobles were <I><FONT color=brown>disdainful</FONT></I> of the peasants. <I><FONT color=brown>Scornful</FONT></I> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>disdainful</FONT></I> in indicating greater emotional hostility to whatever is being condemned; <I><FONT color=brown>disdainful</FONT></I>, in comparison, may more readily suggest archness or haughtiness based on a sense of social superiority: a <I><FONT color=brown>scornful</FONT></I> attack by his enraged opponent; dismissing her maid with a <I><FONT color=brown>disdainful</FONT></I> nod. <I><FONT color=brown>Scornful</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I> are closer in tone, but <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I> suggest negative evaluation that may be expressed in ironic ways. <I><FONT color=brown>Scornful</FONT></I> points more to reaction than evaluation and might apply to more direct expression: a <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I> look that suggested how worthless he found her proposal to be; a <I><FONT color=brown>scornful</FONT></I> outburst.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Insolent</FONT></B> intensifies aspects implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>disdainful</FONT></I>, suggesting an arrogant or impudent pride that is expressed in rude behaviour: the prima donna’s <I><FONT color=brown>insolent</FONT></I> remarks about the director’s ineptness. Where someone might be justified in feeling <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>scornful</FONT></I> of something ?or even <I><FONT color=brown>disdainful</FONT></I> ?<I><FONT color=brown>insolent</FONT></I> always indicates a peremptory or overweening grandiosity. <B><FONT color=blue>Audacious</FONT></B>, while conveying some sense of boldness or adventurousness, more often applies to reckless behaviour that is conspicuous and outrageous: His <I><FONT color=brown>audacious</FONT></I> manners are a effrontery to good taste.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Supercilious</FONT></B> indicates a haughty or affected manner that is so excessive or unfounded as to become pompous or ridiculous: <I><FONT color=brown>supercilious</FONT></I> flattery; a plain-spoken man who was <I><FONT color=brown>contemptuous</FONT></I> of her <I><FONT color=brown>supercilious</FONT></I> airs and grand gestures. The word comes from the Latin for eyebrow; raised eyebrows are often characteristic of a <I><FONT color=brown>supercilious</FONT></I> expression.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conceited">CONCEITED</A>, <A href="entry://Hostile">HOSTILE</A>, <A href="entry://Overbearing">OVERBEARING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: considerate, humble, <A href="entry://Polite">POLITE</A>, respectful, reverent.</P>

By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>content</FONT></I> almost exclusively appears as a predicated adjective and suggests, not the full or complete filling of needs or desire, but the willingness to accept a modest or reasonable amount: peasants who were thought the be <I><FONT color=brown>content</FONT></I> with their humble station in life; The reporter tried to feel <I><FONT color=brown>content</FONT></I> with the brief interview he was granted.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Satisfied</FONT></B> is closer to contented than to content in suggesting complete appeasement of need or desire: gorging himself until he felt almost uncomfortably <I><FONT color=brown>satisfied</FONT></I>. The word contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>contented</FONT></I> in that the latter may more often refer to a state of mind akin to complacency, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>satisfied</FONT></I> more often suggests the filling of a particular need: dull, <I><FONT color=brown>contented</FONT></I> faces, <I><FONT color=brown>satisfied</FONT></I> about his marks in the exam.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gratified</FONT></B> suggests unambiguous joy in the fulfilling of a need or desire; in this it is more intense than either <I><FONT color=brown>satisfied</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>contented</FONT></I>: a longing for excitement that was only fully <I><FONT color=brown>gratified</FONT></I> when he moved to the big city. <I><FONT color=brown>Gratified</FONT></I> can also function in a wider range than the other words, suggesting happiness at a well-executed task, role or duty: <I><FONT color=brown>gratified</FONT></I> at the way her students took up the challenges she laid down for them. <B><FONT color=blue>Pleased</FONT></B> is less intense than <I><FONT color=brown>gratified</FONT></I> and is the vaguest of these words; it may suggest less demanding needs or desires to begin with: <I><FONT color=brown>pleased</FONT></I> with the refreshing simplicity of her light snack. It would seldom suggest, in fact, that a question of satiation exists, and may have more to do with the expression of mild approval: She was <I><FONT color=brown>pleased</FONT></I> at the courteous way in which he addressed her.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheerful">CHEERFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Comfort">COMFORT</A>, <A href="entry://Joyous">JOYOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: discontent, frustrated, malcontent, <A href="entry://Miserable">MISERABLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the rejection of a previous statement by argument or evidence. <B><FONT color=blue>Contradict</FONT></B> may indicate no more than disagreement with a statement: He flatly <I><FONT color=brown>contradicted</FONT></I> her assertion that he was too lazy to mow the lawn. In this case no attempt at proof may be involved. The word also applies to an obvious discrepancy between statements or things where no proof is necessary: parents who <I><FONT color=brown>contradict</FONT></I> each other when giving orders to their children. [The findings of the two studies <I><FONT color=brown>contradict</FONT></I> each other; His voting record <I><FONT color=brown>contradicts</FONT></I> his claim to be a liberal.] In its widest application, <B><FONT color=blue>deny</FONT></B> can point to something refused or withheld: <I><FONT color=brown>denying</FONT></I> his request for a weekend pass; Substandard schools <I><FONT color=brown>deny</FONT></I> children the chance to learn. In the context of disputes, <I><FONT color=brown>deny</FONT></I> often suggests the specific situation of giving a negative answer to a charge or accusation: The treasurer hotly <I><FONT color=brown>denied</FONT></I> any misappropriation of funds.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gainsay</FONT></B> is a more formal word that is now rarely used in speech; it does suggest that someone gives vocal dissent to an opinion or accusation, perhaps arbitrarily tersely or abruptly, without supporting arguments: her habit of <I><FONT color=brown>gainsaying</FONT></I> anything he suggested. The word most often appears now with a negative: arguments for an appeal that not even the most cautious judge could <I><FONT color=brown>gainsay</FONT></I>; new evidence that simply could not be <I><FONT color=brown>gainsaid</FONT></I>. Here, something is presented as so convincing or conclusive that an arbitrary rejection is not possible. <B><FONT color=blue>Oppose</FONT></B> is far less formal in tone than <I><FONT color=brown>gainsay</FONT></I> and applies widely beyond the context of dispute or argument. It can suggest unreasoning enmity to a position with no attempt to argue or present evidence: They still <I><FONT color=brown>opposed</FONT></I> the new theory despite all the corroborating facts mustered in its defence. <I><FONT color=brown>Oppose</FONT></I> can also suggest reasoned disagreement: the superior skill that his counsel revealed in <I><FONT color=brown>opposing</FONT></I> the prosecution’s arguments.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Contravene</FONT></B> can function like <I><FONT color=brown>contradict</FONT></I> when it points to a discrepancy between statement or things, especially where one entity conflicts with another: No law can stand that <I><FONT color=brown>contravenes</FONT></I> the Consitution. In terms of argument, the word may point to an attempt to overthrow a whole trend of thought by making telling points: a speech in which he marshalled every available argument that might help him to <I><FONT color=brown>contravene</FONT></I> the objections to the bill’s passage.</P><P>The previous words are mainly concerned with situations in which one statement is at odds with another. The remaining words all can indicate the situation in which a statement or position is demolished by facts or evidence. <B><FONT color=blue>Disprove</FONT></B> is the most forceful of these, indicating that a statement, proposition, theory or even something accepted as a fact has been demonstrated as untrue by countering evidence: explorers who <I><FONT color=brown>disproved</FONT></I> the notion that the world was flat; he <I><FONT color=brown>denied</FONT></I> her assertion, but couldn’t <I><FONT color=brown>disprove</FONT></I> it. When two scientific theories contradict each other, for example, further investigation will disprove one or the other or both, whether in whole or in part. <B><FONT color=blue>Controvert</FONT></B>, a more formal word, points to someone who apposes a given view and wishes to disprove it by offering evidence: His opponents searched the data given in his report, hoping to find inconsistencies by which they could <I><FONT color=brown>controvert</FONT></I> his findings. When contrasted with <I><FONT color=brown>contravene</FONT></I>, the emphasis of <I><FONT color=brown>controvert</FONT></I> falls more heavily on <I><FONT color=brown>controvert</FONT></I> them. <B><FONT color=blue>Refute</FONT></B> can suggest the successful demolishing of an argument by reasoning alone but it applies even more forcefully when supporting evidence is suggested: They <I><FONT color=brown>refuted</FONT></I> his claim of innocence with eyewitness testimony.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compete">COMPETE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: affirm, agree, corroborate, maintain, <A href="entry://Uphold">UPHOLD</A>.</P>

contradictory
<B><FONT color=blue>contradictory</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>conflicting</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>contrary</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>opposed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>opposite</FONT></B>:

<P>These words describe statements, opinions, concepts, methods or emotions that are incompatible. The term <B><FONT color=blue>contradictory</FONT></B> refers to things that mutually exclude each other so that both cannot exist in the same object at the same time, as life and death. In formal logic two statements are <I><FONT color=brown>contradictory</FONT></I> if they cannot both be true and cannot both be false. In other words, the statements are so related that if one is true the other must be false, as <I><FONT color=brown>I am</FONT></I> a<I><FONT color=brown> New Zealander</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>I am not</FONT></I> a<I><FONT color=brown> New Zealander</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Contrary</FONT></B> statements, on the other hand, cannot both be true, but they can both be false, as <I><FONT color=brown>I am</FONT></I> an<I><FONT color=brown> Italian</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>I am</FONT></I> a<I><FONT color=brown> Frenchman</FONT></I>. The falsity of either <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I> proves nothing about the other, but the truth of one establishes the falsity of the other. In a general sense, <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I> points to a basic difference in essence or disagreement in purpose or aim: a <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I> viewpoint. Things are <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I> when the highest degree of both cannot exist in the same object at the same time, but where a middle term is possible partaking of the qualities of both. Thus wisdom and folly are <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I>, for the perfection of either excludes any trace of the other; yet most human acts and statements partake of both.</P><P>Loosely, <I><FONT color=brown>contradictory</FONT></I> may mean no more than differing significantly: <I><FONT color=brown>contradictory</FONT></I> versions of an accident. In this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>contradictory</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>conflicting</FONT></B> are often interchangeable. <I><FONT color=brown>Conflicting</FONT></I> means clashing and stresses discord, implying mutual antagonism, as of interest, feelings or ideas: <I><FONT color=brown>conflicting</FONT></I> opinions as to the best location for the new school; The prospect of a return to his home town filled him with <I><FONT color=brown>conflicting</FONT></I> emotions.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Opposite</FONT></B> comes close to contradictory in referring to things that are diametrically different in tendency, character or point of view: <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> opinions; the <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> sex. But <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> is more likely to be applied to difference in direction, position or condition than to mutually exclusive statements. [The condition <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> to cold is heat; the direction <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> to north is south; Black and white are often said to be <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I>.] Where <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> refers to position, tendency or the like, <B><FONT color=blue>opposed</FONT></B> is chiefly used of feeling and intent. People who live on <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> sides of a fence may or may not be <I><FONT color=brown>opposed</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Contrary</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>opposed</FONT></I> are often used interchangeably to mean differing from in any way: to do something that is <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>opposed</FONT></I>) to another person’s wishes. In other uses, <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I> suggests active opposition, and <I><FONT color=brown>opposed</FONT></I> implies passive contrariness. A person holding a <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I> point of view may suggest that a different line of action should be taken. But a person may be <I><FONT color=brown>opposed</FONT></I> to a line and action without proposing any alternative. Both <I><FONT color=brown>contradictory</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>contrary</FONT></I> may be used to describe persons who perversely beg to differ at every possible opportunity.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Controversy">CONTROVERSY</A>, <A href="entry://Disparate">DISPARATE</A>, <A href="entry://Opposed">OPPOSED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: accordant, acquiescent, agreeing, compatible, concordant, consenting, consistent, corresponding, harmonious.</P>

<P>To <B><FONT color=blue>control</FONT></B> is to exercise a restraining or dominating influence over a person or thing. <B><FONT color=blue>Regulate</FONT></B> means to order or <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I> by rule, method or established mode. A major shareholder may <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I> a large block of shares in a company. The police may attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I> an unruly mob. The Department of Civil Aviation <I><FONT color=brown>regulates</FONT></I> private and commercial flying: A government may <I><FONT color=brown>regulate</FONT></I> its balance-of-trade payments by <I><FONT color=brown>controlling</FONT></I> exports.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Direct</FONT></B> stresses guidance and refers to the exercise of leadership: to <I><FONT color=brown>direct</FONT></I> a play. <I><FONT color=brown>Direct</FONT></I> may refer specifically to the <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I> or conduct of affairs: to <I><FONT color=brown>direct</FONT></I> a large company. In this sense, it is close to <B><FONT color=blue>manage</FONT></B>, which emphasizes operational <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>manage</FONT></I> a hotel; to <I><FONT color=brown>manage</FONT></I> a campaign. Of the two verbs, however, <I><FONT color=brown>direct</FONT></I> implies a stronger, overall <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I>, while <I><FONT color=brown>manage</FONT></I> often refers to the actual running or handling of specific affairs, and may imply delegated authority. He personally <I><FONT color=brown>directed</FONT></I> the nation’s foreign policy. A person may be appointed to <I><FONT color=brown>manage</FONT></I> a business for the owner.</P><P>The verb <B><FONT color=blue>administer</FONT></B> implies official management and direction of affairs: a well-<I><FONT color=brown>administered</FONT></I> state government. It indicates the performing of executive functions and may be used of government or institutional officials. The head of a government department <I><FONT color=brown>administer</FONT></I> the funds allotted to his department. The vice-chancellor of a university may <I><FONT color=brown>administer</FONT></I> the establishment’s financial affairs. In a strictly legal sense, <I><FONT color=brown>administer</FONT></I> means to act as an executor or trustee in settling or managing an estate: to <I><FONT color=brown>administer</FONT></I> the estate of a deceased or incompetent person. To <B><FONT color=blue>supervise</FONT></B> an operation or an employee is to be in charge of assigning, <I><FONT color=brown>directing</FONT></I> an inspecting the work done. Like <I><FONT color=brown>direct</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>supervise</FONT></I> involves overseeing and guidance; but it indicates a more personal control than <I><FONT color=brown>administer</FONT></I>, and, like <I><FONT color=brown>manage</FONT></I>, may imply the exercise either of personal or of delegated authority: to act as a group leader and <I><FONT color=brown>supervise</FONT></I> a dozen workers. A housewife may <I><FONT color=brown>supervise</FONT></I> the work done by her maid. An office manager may <I><FONT color=brown>supervise</FONT></I> the work of several departments.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>govern</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I> by authority, arbitrarily or constitutionally. <I><FONT color=brown>Govern</FONT></I> implies the exercise of knowledge and judgement as well as power, and usually involves systematic administration. To <B><FONT color=blue>rule</FONT></B> is more autocratic than to <I><FONT color=brown>govern</FONT></I>, implying the exercise of absolute or dictatorial power and the imposition of arbitrary commands. In a democracy, an administration <I><FONT color=brown>governs</FONT></I> with the consent of the majority. A dictator, by contrast, may <I><FONT color=brown>rule</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>govern</FONT></I>) with an iron hand. In a less specific sense, <I><FONT color=brown>govern</FONT></I> often refers to the exerting of any <I><FONT color=brown>controlling</FONT></I> influence: What motives <I><FONT color=brown>governed</FONT></I> his actions? It may also mean to keep in check, and in this sense it may serve as a more formal synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I>: unable to <I><FONT color=brown>govern</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>control</FONT></I>) his temper.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Command">COMMAND</A>, <A href="entry://Guide">GUIDE</A>, <A href="entry://Possess">POSSESS</A>, <A href="entry://Subdue">SUBDUE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Controversy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>discord</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dissension</FONT></B> mean a prolonged disagreement expressed terms ranging from reasonable to belligerent. <I><FONT color=brown>Controversy</FONT></I> is generally applied to disagreements between groups, such as nations, political parties or religious sects. Internationally one speaks of <I><FONT color=brown>controversy</FONT></I> over disarmament; politically, of <I><FONT color=brown>controversy</FONT></I> over federal versus state power; and religiously, of <I><FONT color=brown>controversy</FONT></I> over priestly celibacy. <I><FONT color=brown>Discord</FONT></I> is controversy carried to unpleasant lengths, ad implies an unlikelihood of easy revolution. <I><FONT color=brown>Discord</FONT></I> between branches of a family often lasts for generations. <I><FONT color=brown>Dissension</FONT></I> is factional <I><FONT color=brown>discord</FONT></I>, and is often expressed in voluble protests or accusations: <I><FONT color=brown>dissension</FONT></I> among the rank and file of the union forced a change in leadership.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Argument</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>debate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dispute</FONT></B> mean verbal expressions of disagreement. An <I><FONT color=brown>argument</FONT></I> is usually between individuals, and suggests a combined appeal to reason and to the emotions. It may or may not result in a resolution of the disagreement. [An <I><FONT color=brown>argument</FONT></I> between parents regarding the rearing of their children often goes on for years; The referee always wins the <I><FONT color=brown>argument</FONT></I> about a free kick in football.] A <I><FONT color=brown>debate</FONT></I> is an <I><FONT color=brown>argument</FONT></I> between selected individuals or groups, and is carefully controlled and monitored; it is normally limited to an appeal to reason, and is usually an attempt to arrive at the truth rather than to overpower by tricks of oratory: A parliamentary <I><FONT color=brown>debate</FONT></I> on a piece of proposed legislation is designed to bring out all the relevant facts to enable members to vote on the merits of the bill. A <I><FONT color=brown>dispute</FONT></I> is an <I><FONT color=brown>argument</FONT></I> carried on over a long period of time and is often marked by heated clashes: The <I><FONT color=brown>dispute</FONT></I> over an international boundary produced a long exchange of strong allegations couched in diplomatic language.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Contention</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>friction</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>conflict</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>strife</FONT></B> mean disagreement carried so far as to be marked by ill will and sometimes by hostile actions. <I><FONT color=brown>Contention</FONT></I> is usually limited to verbal <I><FONT color=brown>discord</FONT></I> carried to extreme lengths, and implies vying for a contested goal. <I><FONT color=brown>Contention</FONT></I> between rival camps at a political convention is often acrimonious. <I><FONT color=brown>Friction</FONT></I> implies a steady and continuous disagreement between individuals or groups, and is characterized by frequent clashes. <I><FONT color=brown>Friction</FONT></I> between labour and management can result in mutual recriminations, strikes and lockouts. <I><FONT color=brown>Conflict</FONT></I> implies a disagreement so violent that resolution by action other than verbal must be resorted to: The <I><FONT color=brown>conflict</FONT></I> between Guelphs and Ghibellines in medieval Italy passed from controversy over papal authority to petty wars between city-states. <I><FONT color=brown>Strife</FONT></I> implies a <I><FONT color=brown>conflict</FONT></I> so basic and contestants so implacable that it is characterized by continuous hostility and an uncompromising attitude: The tactics of the cold war are resorted to in the <I><FONT color=brown>strife</FONT></I> between contending power blocs. <I><FONT color=brown>Strife</FONT></I> is also used loosely and hyperbolically for trouble: If I’m late home I'll be in <I><FONT color=brown>strife</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bickering</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>quarrel</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wrangle</FONT></B> mean <I><FONT color=brown>argument</FONT></I> about petty matters, usually carried on in a petulant manner. These words may be applied to individuals or groups, and carry a suggestion of opprobrium. <I><FONT color=brown>Bickering</FONT></I> suggests a prolonged exchange of ill-tempered remarks: <I><FONT color=brown>bickering</FONT></I> about who should be first in line. <I><FONT color=brown>Quarrel</FONT></I> is more general in application; it is usually highly personal and can range from a mild verbal <I><FONT color=brown>dispute</FONT></I> to a violent <I><FONT color=brown>argument</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>quarrel</FONT></I> between neighbours about a borrowed lawn mower; violent <I><FONT color=brown>quarrels</FONT></I> in which she hurled pots and pans at him and he knocked her about like a rag doll. A <I><FONT color=brown>wrangle</FONT></I> is an angry or noisy <I><FONT color=brown>quarrel</FONT></I>; the suggestion of petulant intransigence is especially strong, and the word often implies an unwillingness to listen to reason or to be understanding of the other person’s point of view: a long <I><FONT color=brown>wrangle</FONT></I> over who should pay the bill.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Disagree">DISAGREE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: agreement, coincidence, consensus, unanimity.</P>

<P>These words refer to formal or informal vocal exchanges. <B><FONT color=blue>Conversation</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>discussion</FONT></B> are the most general of these, the former applying mainly to an informal social situation, the latter applying often but not exclusively to a formal or official situation. <I><FONT color=brown>Conversation</FONT></I>, of course, can and does take place at extremely formal affairs, but in this case the word points to incidental exchanges that are not usually the main point of such a gathering. Much more often the tone of the word suggests a relaxed, informal atmosphere, either festive or intimate: a party at which the <I><FONT color=brown>conversation</FONT></I> flowed like wine; a long <I><FONT color=brown>conversation</FONT></I> between the two of them over nightcaps of brandy. Any situation, however, in which two or more people speak to each other at some length and constitute a <I><FONT color=brown>conversation</FONT></I>: He warned her against getting into <I><FONT color=brown>conversation</FONT></I> with other passengers on the train. When <I><FONT color=brown>discussion</FONT></I> indicates formal or arranged situation, it still suggests a free-and easy meeting in which people express their views or sentiments to one another: asking the committee to hold open <I><FONT color=brown>discussions</FONT></I> on the sousing project. The word can specifically point to a period that follows some sort of one-sided presentation, one during which audience reaction is heard: a <I><FONT color=brown>discussion</FONT></I> that was to take place after the play; the general <I><FONT color=brown>discussion</FONT></I> following his speech. When <I><FONT color=brown>discussion</FONT></I> suggests an even more informal situation, the word still differs from <I><FONT color=brown>conversation</FONT></I> in indicating a purposeful approach that limits itself to a given theme, possibly to arrive at conclusions or determine a course of action: family <I><FONT color=brown>discussions</FONT></I> in which each member can openly present his grievances; an innocuous <I><FONT color=brown>conversation</FONT></I> that turned into a heated <I><FONT color=brown>discussion</FONT></I> on police brutality.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dialogue</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>colloquy</FONT></B> are more formal than the previous words, particularly the latter. <I><FONT color=brown>Dialogue</FONT></I> can refer to speeches in a play or to essays in play form. In the context of conversation, it strictly suggests a two-person exchange, yet this distinction is commonly ignored. The word has recently come to mean arranged discussions among people of dissimilar views: a new <I><FONT color=brown>dialogue</FONT></I> among the Protestant denominations and the Catholic church; a year-round <I><FONT color=brown>dialogue</FONT></I> between labour and management. <I><FONT color=brown>Colloquy</FONT></I> is an extremely formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>discussion</FONT></I>, and is typically used of formal situations: an extended <I><FONT color=brown>colloquy</FONT></I> between the witness and the defence counsel. It may refer to a high-level prearranged conference: a continuing <I><FONT color=brown>colloquy</FONT></I> on disarmament at the ambassadorial level. It might also be used humorously to suggest guarded verbal exchanges: my tense <I><FONT color=brown>colloquy</FONT></I> with the customs inspector.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Talk</FONT></B> is both relatively informal and very general. It can serve as an informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>conversation</FONT></I>, with greater emphasis on intimacy, sincerity and frankness: looking forward to having a good long <I><FONT color=brown>talk</FONT></I> with all his old friends; feeling relieved after their heart-to-heart <I><FONT color=brown>talk</FONT></I>. It can also refer to the substance of <I><FONT color=brown>conversations</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>discussions</FONT></I>: soirées where the people were interesting and the <I><FONT color=brown>talk</FONT></I> scintillating. The word can also refer informally to a one-sided presentation, as a speech or a lecture: a <I><FONT color=brown>talk</FONT></I> on the housing project. Sometimes, the word is a more general substitute for gossip: indiscreet behaviour that caused <I><FONT color=brown>talk</FONT></I> among the neighbours.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chat</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tête-à-tête</FONT></B> are emphatic about the informality and intimacy of the conversation they point to. But <I><FONT color=brown>chat</FONT></I>, most informal of all these words, can refer to two or more people and most strongly suggests light, pleasant, and rambling <I><FONT color=brown>talk</FONT></I> in which personal matters, if touched on, are purused without great intensity: an hour’s <I><FONT color=brown>chat</FONT></I> about the doings of their mutual friends; a <I><FONT color=brown>chat</FONT></I> between mother and daughter about the girl’s growing-up problems. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>tête-à-tête</FONT></I> specifically indicates a talk between two people (literally, head-to-head), in which the emphasis is on sincerity and frankness of a confidential, romantic or even conspiratorial sort: seen having a <I><FONT color=brown>tête-à-tête</FONT></I> with her husband’s employer; a <I><FONT color=brown>tête-à-tête</FONT></I> between representative of the two deadlocked candidates.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Argue">ARGUE</A>, <A href="entry://Chatter">CHATTER</A>, <A href="entry://Patter">PATTER</A>, <A href="entry://Speech">SPEECH</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a pleasant, warm, cheerful or high-spirited disposition or manner. <B><FONT color=blue>Blithe</FONT></B> indicates an attitude that is cheerful, mirthful, joyous or gay: <I><FONT color=brown>blithe</FONT></I> crowds enjoying the sunny weather in the park. The word can have a less favourable application to a manner that is casual, indifferent or airy, particularly when directed towards something that should be taken seriously: listening to my grievance with a <I><FONT color=brown>blithe</FONT></I> lack of concern.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Genial</FONT></B> points to a more low-key or long-term good-humoured attitude that is exhibited in a kindly, pleasant or warm manner; it suggests an unruffled or even temper and an ability to put people at ease: an extremely <I><FONT color=brown>genial</FONT></I> host. <B><FONT color=blue>Light-hearted</FONT></B> is closer in tone to <I><FONT color=brown>blithe</FONT></I>, since it suggests an absence of care or a positive state of buoyant delight: <I><FONT color=brown>light-hearted</FONT></I> youngsters singing as the hiked through the bush. A contrast of how one feels, whereas the very essence of <I><FONT color=brown>light-hearted</FONT></I> is its suggestion of a spontaneous welling up of high spirits. <I><FONT color=brown>Genial</FONT></I>, furthermore, suggests friendly relationships with others; <I><FONT color=brown>light-hearted</FONT></I> may pertain to someone completely alone.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Convivial</FONT></B> serves as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>genial</FONT></I>, suggesting jolly sociability and warm fellow-feeling; its Latin root pertains to a feast or banquet and this is often reflected in the English use of the word: <I><FONT color=brown>convivial</FONT></I> merrymakers at the carnival. <B><FONT color=blue>Jovial</FONT></B> may suggest sociability, but it is less specific in indicating any sort of good-natured amiability. The word is very often used to describe a jolly but dignified fat man, so much so that the word is sometimes taken to specify this situation. Similarly, <I><FONT color=brown>blithe</FONT></I> sometimes suggests a spry, elfin or fey person, particularly a woman.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Elated</FONT></B> an <B><FONT color=blue>ebullient</FONT></B> both refer, like <I><FONT color=brown>light-hearted</FONT></I>, to a welling up of high spirits. <I><FONT color=brown>Elated</FONT></I>, however, can often refer to a response to some external occurrence or news, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>ebullient</FONT></I> suggests the same spontaneity as light-hearted. <I><FONT color=brown>Ebullient</FONT></I> stems from the root of a Latin word meaning to boil out, and the English word reflects this in pointing to a bubbling over with enthusiasm, excitement or exuberance: fans who were <I><FONT color=brown>elated</FONT></I> when the team scored another goal; an <I><FONT color=brown>ebullient</FONT></I> personality that always seemed to overflow with vivacity and zest.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Pleasure">PLEASURE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dismal">DISMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Gloomy">GLOOMY</A>, ill-humoured, melancholic, morose, <A href="entry://Sad">SAD</A>, sullen, <A href="entry://Tranquil">TRANQUIL</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to involuntary upheavals that disrupt normal processes. <B><FONT color=blue>Convulsion</FONT></B>, most specifically, suggests a violent contraction of muscles, as when the body is struggling to throw off a poison; since these contractions come in a series, the plural is often used in this physiological sense: a case of ptomaine poising that resulted in fatal <I><FONT color=brown>convulsion</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Spasm</FONT></B> refers to any involuntary convulsive muscular contraction. When manifested by alternate contractions and relaxations it is a <I><FONT color=brown>clonic spasm</FONT></I>; when persistent and steady, it is a <I><FONT color=brown>tonic spasm</FONT></I>. Like <I><FONT color=brown>convulsion</FONT></I>, spasm can be used to refer figuratively to any sudden, violent change or burst of feverish activity: a <I><FONT color=brown>spasm</FONT></I> of fear every time she recalled the accident; a series of <I><FONT color=brown>convulsions</FONT></I> due to the abrupt rise in tariffs. <I><FONT color=brown>Convulsion</FONT></I>, both in its figurative and physiological sense, suggests involuntary movement of greater intensity and severity than spasm.</P><P>F<B><FONT color=blue>i</FONT></B>t is more informal than convulsion and suggests a malfunction of psychological or physiological processes rather than the attempt to reject a poison. It is still commonly used to describe an attack of epilepsy: an epileptic <I><FONT color=brown>fit</FONT></I>. But the word may sound outdated when applied to a psychological malfunction: a <I><FONT color=brown>fit</FONT></I> of madness. It is, however, frequently used jocosely to describe being overcome by any extremely intense emotion that has physical manifestations: a <I><FONT color=brown>fit</FONT></I> of anger; a <I><FONT color=brown>fit</FONT></I> of laughter that left us weak; a <I><FONT color=brown>fit</FONT></I> of hiccups.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Seizure</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>convulsion</FONT></I>, can apply in a number of context. It can be used in conjunction with <I><FONT color=brown>convulsion</FONT></I> and as a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>fit</FONT></I>. It emphasizes the involuntary nature of the affliction: a <I><FONT color=brown>seizure</FONT></I> of <I><FONT color=brown>convulsions</FONT></I>; an epileptic <I><FONT color=brown>seizure</FONT></I>. In the latter case, the substitution might once have seemed euphemistic; now, however, it is merely more dispassionate and objective than fit, which when used in this sense evokes the pre-Freudian era when epileptics were considered accursed. <I><FONT color=brown>Seizure</FONT></I> can apply to other intense physical or emotional upheavals: a <I><FONT color=brown>seizure</FONT></I> of coughing; a psychotic <I><FONT color=brown>seizure</FONT></I>. It can also refer to group responses: a nation paralysed by a <I><FONT color=brown>seizure</FONT></I> of terror following the assassination.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Paroxysm</FONT></B> may pertain to a physiological situation, referring the one of series: <I><FONT color=brown>convulsions</FONT></I> in which each <I><FONT color=brown>paroxysm</FONT></I> was more prolonged than the one before. More commonly, however, it is used in the plural to refer to an acute emotional attack. In this case, it is like seizure in avoiding the jocose overtones of fit, but is more intense than either, even to the point of hyperbole: <I><FONT color=brown>paroxysms</FONT></I> of anger; <I><FONT color=brown>paroxysms</FONT></I> of grief.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: HEART <A href="entry://Attack">ATTACK</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to something that resembles, completes or corresponds to another thing. <B><FONT color=blue>Counterpart</FONT></B>, the most general, can function in all these ways, though it specifically suggests a close relationship between the two things considered. In reference to resemblance, it suggests a precise or near likeness: the very <I><FONT color=brown>counterpart</FONT></I> of his father. In reference to completion, it suggests two things that form an entity: finding that he had the first volume of the work but lacked its <I><FONT color=brown>counterpart</FONT></I>. In reference to correspondence, the word particularly suggests one of a matching pair of things that are alike but opposite: a coffee table that separated one piece of the sectional lounge from its <I><FONT color=brown>counterpart</FONT></I>. In this last sense <B><FONT color=blue>opposite</FONT></B> number is sometimes used, but unlike <I><FONT color=brown>counterpart</FONT></I>. It need indicate no likeness in appearance, only in function. An <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> number is a person or thing that corresponds to another in terms of each’s relation to the sets of which they are part. In some instances <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> numbers may be physically opposed, as forwards in a football game; in others they may simply play similar roles, as full-backs of two <I><FONT color=brown>opposing</FONT></I> teams. Two men doing similar kinds of work with different firms may be called <I><FONT color=brown>opposite</FONT></I> number or counterparts. It is to be noted that when the <I><FONT color=brown>opposition</FONT></I> becomes more a matter of role than of physical position, <I><FONT color=brown>counterpart</FONT></I> comes into play as a synonyms for opposite number. But <I><FONT color=brown>counterpart</FONT></I> is in any event more elevated in tone.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Correlate</FONT></B> indicates a much closer relationship than <I><FONT color=brown>counterpart</FONT></I>, but need not imply likeness at all. It indicates instead interdependence or reciprocity, with or without the suggestion that one of two things is a cause of the other: the high crime rate that is an inevitable <I><FONT color=brown>correlate</FONT></I> of slum conditions. The word can, however, suggest one of two similar things, each existing in mutually exclusive areas; in this case any notion of causality is distinctly absent: tales of the Samurai that have their <I><FONT color=brown>correlate</FONT></I> in European Arthurian legends. <B><FONT color=blue>Parallel</FONT></B> Is related to this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>correlate</FONT></I>, but, in this case, a slighter resemblance may be suggested; again, no causality is implied. [The current birth-control controversy has a <I><FONT color=brown>parallel</FONT></I> in the similar dispute about usury in medieval times.] <I><FONT color=brown>Parallel</FONT></I> can point to a more essential likeness, correspondence or match, but the word’s clear reference to the geometric situation of lines that run equidistant to each other gives strong implications of kinship but not of close contact or causality. <I><FONT color=brown>Parallel</FONT></I>, however, is the one word here that readily suggests similarity between several things, rather than just two: a plot that has innumerable <I><FONT color=brown>parallels</FONT></I> in the detective novels of the past decade.</P><P>Of all the words here, <B><FONT color=blue>complement</FONT></B> puts the least stress on likeness and similarity; none at all, in fact, need be suggested by the word. Instead, the word points to one of two things that together make up a whole. These two things, furthermore, need not be equal halves or mirror images as is the case with <I><FONT color=brown>counterpart</FONT></I>: a woman in whom intelligence and femininity were not antagonists but <I><FONT color=brown>complements</FONT></I> to each other; a year-end bonus that was a small but by no means negligible <I><FONT color=brown>complement</FONT></I> to his annual earnings. The word should not, of course, be confused with <I><FONT color=brown>compliment</FONT></I>, which refers to praise or flattery given by one person to another.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Copy">COPY</A>, <A href="entry://Duplicate">DUPLICATE</A>, <A href="entry://Similar">SIMILAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: antithesis, contradiction, contrast, opposite.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>countless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>immeasurable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>incalculable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>innumerable</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to quantities or sizes that are great, infinite or difficult to determine. <B><FONT color=blue>Countless</FONT></B> refers to large amounts that are difficult or impossible to total either because of their vastness or because their full extent is not known or unknowable: <I><FONT color=brown>countless</FONT></I> grains of sand scattered by the wind. Though the visible stars in the sky are often hyperbolically referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>countless</FONT></I>, they have in fact been counted, as well as those studied by other means. In the strictest sense, only those that may exist beyond any observation are <I><FONT color=brown>countless</FONT></I>, though these may be few or great or even infinite in number. Similarly, <I><FONT color=brown>countless</FONT></I> may refer to large quantities that cannot now be totalled: the <I><FONT color=brown>countless</FONT></I> numbers who died of malaria before the discovery of quinine. While <I><FONT color=brown>countless</FONT></I> may sometimes refer to instances in time and <B><FONT color=blue>innumerable</FONT></B> may refer to quantities in space, the latter is particularly used for occurrences that cannot be totalled because of frequency or lack of record: <I><FONT color=brown>innumerable</FONT></I> instances in the past when a new idea was found dangerous to the established order. The word is frequently used merely as a hyperbole for may: <I><FONT color=brown>innumerable</FONT></I> occasions on which he had stayed out all night carousing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Immeasurable</FONT></B> refers more strictly to spatial size or to dimensions that are either infinite or completely impossible to determine. Thus, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>countless</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>innumerable</FONT></I>, the word is less likely to be used hyperbolically, whether to refer to greatness or difficulty of reckoning: distances that in an infinite universe would be literally <I><FONT color=brown>immeasurable</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>immeasurable</FONT></I> quantities of natural resources that were lost forever through misuse. <B><FONT color=blue>Incalculable</FONT></B> most strictly resembles the first pair of words in referring to large amounts difficult to total. The word may also be used like <I><FONT color=brown>immeasurable</FONT></I> for large volumes, but in this case the size may be hard to determine because of its uncertain dimensions: a deep trough on the sea floor, one of <I><FONT color=brown>incalculable</FONT></I> size. More commonly, however, the word refers particularly to the effects something has, when these are difficult or impossible to determine or can never be known: the <I><FONT color=brown>incalculable</FONT></I> effects of Luther’s break with Rome, effects that still have not run their course; the <I><FONT color=brown>incalculable</FONT></I> benefits that ripple outwards from even the most trivial act of kindness; aware that he was taking an <I><FONT color=brown>incalculable</FONT></I> risk.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Infinite">INFINITE</A>, <A href="entry://Massive">MASSIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: calculable, limitary, measurable, numbered.</P>

<P>These words refer to a bold and determined attitude that is undaunted by difficulties and fearless in the face of danger. <B><FONT color=blue>Courage</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bravery</FONT></B> are the most general words embracing all the rest. They indicate a dauntless spirit and the ability to act fearlessly under stress or to endure in times of adversity: the <I><FONT color=brown>courage</FONT></I> of the fighting men; his <I><FONT color=brown>bravery</FONT></I> under fire; the rocklike <I><FONT color=brown>courage</FONT></I> of a mother who lost three sons in the war. A person may show <I><FONT color=brown>courage</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>bravery</FONT></I> in response to circumstances, doing what is necessary despite the personal brisk involved. But <I><FONT color=brown>courage</FONT></I> may also imply a firmness that arises from a strong belief in the moral rightness of a position or course of action: he has the <I><FONT color=brown>courage</FONT></I> of his convictions.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fortitude</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words, indicating firmness or strength of mind. It emphasizes the facing of obstacles with brave and unwavering resourcefulness: an ordeal that required every ounce of <I><FONT color=brown>fortitude</FONT></I> he possessed; the <I><FONT color=brown>fortitude</FONT></I> of a Daniel in the lion’s den. <B><FONT color=blue>Resolution</FONT></B> is far less inclusive than <I><FONT color=brown>fortitude</FONT></I>. It implies a determination to be firm in conviction, faithful in allegiance, unswerving in course or unwavering in devotion to a task. <I><FONT color=brown>Resolution</FONT></I> does not necessarily suggest fearlessness but emphasizes the firm pushing aside of any mental reservations or qualms about attaining an objective: the <I><FONT color=brown>resolution</FONT></I> with which he ran into the burning house despite the terror that possessed him.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Nerve</FONT></B> may be compared to <I><FONT color=brown>fortitude</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>pluck</FONT></B> to <I><FONT color=brown>resolution</FONT></I>, although both these words are considerably more informal than the previous pair. <I><FONT color=brown>Nerve</FONT></I> is particularly emphatic in stressing the unflustered, cook and steady daring with which someone takes calculated risks to win an objective: the <I><FONT color=brown>nerve</FONT></I> with which he drew himself, hand over hand, along the last cable of the broken rope bridge. Sometimes, even more informally, the word suggests brashness or rudeness in a social situation. [He had a lot of <I><FONT color=brown>nerve</FONT></I> to ask her the day before the dance; You’ve got some <I><FONT color=brown>nerve</FONT></I> coming in here without knocking.] <I><FONT color=brown>Pluck</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>resolution</FONT></I>, need not suggest the fearlessness of <I><FONT color=brown>fortitude</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>nerve</FONT></I>, but it does suggest a jaunty willingness to try anything, whether out of high spirits, conviction or the zealous eagerness of the good sport: any lowering of moral could endanger the <I><FONT color=brown>pluck</FONT></I> of our fighting forces; a stripling who showed more <I><FONT color=brown>pluck</FONT></I> on the climb than many a seasoned mountaineer.</P><P>The remaining words are more informal still, with less clearly defined spheres of separate meanings, all being colourful substitutes for <I><FONT color=brown>courage</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Backbone</FONT></B> may suggest strength of character or stubborn determination, while <B><FONT color=blue>grit</FONT></B> may refer to a resolute spirit or a tenacious enduring power: having the <I><FONT color=brown>backbone</FONT></I> to endure ridicule for his unpopular views; showing his <I><FONT color=brown>grit</FONT></I> by taking every indignity the drill sergeant foisted upon him. <B><FONT color=blue>Guts</FONT></B>, a slang word, implies brashness or presumptuous audacity: having the <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I> to ask his boss for a rise after his first month in the job; everyone hates his <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I>. But <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I> more often indicates an admirable display of <I><FONT color=brown>courage</FONT></I> when it really counts, and is in this sense synonymous with the cliché intestinal <I><FONT color=brown>fortitude</FONT></I>: the policeman who showed real <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I> in a running gunfight with bank robbers; It took <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I> to stand up against the mob.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Brave">BRAVE</A>, <A href="entry://Effrontery">EFFRONTERY</A>, <A href="entry://Opportunistic">OPPORTUNISTIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: cowardice, cowardliness, <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>, pusillanimity, timidity, timorousness.</P>

<P>These words denote promises or understandings made between two or more parties as to a course of action.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Covenant</FONT></B> carries strong overtones of obligation and responsibility. A <I><FONT color=brown>covenant</FONT></I> is often a solemn pledge made by members of a religious or other dedicated group to maintain and promote a body of doctrine or a set of principles: the <I><FONT color=brown>Covenant</FONT></I> of the Liberty of Worship drawn up on Scotland in 1557; the <I><FONT color=brown>Covenant</FONT></I> of the League of Nations. A <I><FONT color=brown>covenant</FONT></I> in a legal contract or agreement places some obligation on the parties concerned, usually against some possible action: a <I><FONT color=brown>covenant</FONT></I> on the sale of building land stipulating that only brick dwelling shall be erected.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agreement</FONT></B> is the most general and most positive term, suggesting that a settlement has already been reached. <I><FONT color=brown>Agreements</FONT></I> range in importance from those made informally between persons to those drawn up between countries or state. [By tacit <I><FONT color=brown>agreement</FONT></I>, Clark’s friends all avoided any mention of his mentally ill wife; During the course of history, many <I><FONT color=brown>agreements</FONT></I> have been made between France and England.]</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>contract</FONT></B> is a formal <I><FONT color=brown>agreement</FONT></I> almost always in written form and enforceable by law. <I><FONT color=brown>Contracts</FONT></I> may be drawn up for the performance of work at a fixed rate and within a given period: a <I><FONT color=brown>contract</FONT></I> to deliver military supplies to the government; a <I><FONT color=brown>contract</FONT></I> signed by an author to write a history of the town for its forthcoming centenary. Or it may be a binding, legalized <I><FONT color=brown>agreement</FONT></I> between persons: a marriage <I><FONT color=brown>contract</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Compact</FONT></B> carries the idea of a solemn agreement between persons or between political groups or states. A <I><FONT color=brown>compact</FONT></I> may or may not be in written form, but the chief guarantee of its being carried out is that each party is under strong pressures of obligation and mutual trust. [The two brothers made a <I><FONT color=brown>compact</FONT></I> that the family business would always be handed down to their descendants; Faust made a <I><FONT color=brown>compact</FONT></I> with Satan; The seven nations made a <I><FONT color=brown>compact</FONT></I> to regulate tariffs.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Concordat</FONT></B> is confined to formal <I><FONT color=brown>agreements</FONT></I> between the papacy and a national government to terminate or avert dissension between the Roman Catholic Church and civil power.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Treaty">TREATY</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>cowardly</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>craven</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pusillanimous</FONT></B>:

<P>These words mean lacking courage to a degree that arouses disapproval and disgust. <B><FONT color=blue>Cowardly</FONT></B> is the most common word of the three, and is applied opprobriously to persons who are unwilling or unable to prevent their fear or timidity from influencing their actions unduly; it can also refer to the actions themselves: In the Wild West, shooting a man in the back was considered <I><FONT color=brown>cowardly</FONT></I>; too <I><FONT color=brown>cowardly</FONT></I> to stand up and fight.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Craven</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pusillanimous</FONT></B> are formal words encountered mainly in writing. <I><FONT color=brown>Craven</FONT></I> is applied to persons or conduct that is outrageously or abjectly <I><FONT color=brown>cowardly</FONT></I>, and that flagrantly violates the prevailing cultural standards of courage: The <I><FONT color=brown>craven</FONT></I> captive grovelled at our feet, begging for mercy. <I><FONT color=brown>Pusillanimous</FONT></I> differs from the other terms in pointing more strongly to temperamental timidity than to fear as the basis of the resulting action or inaction. <I><FONT color=brown>Pusillanimous</FONT></I> represents a contemptible moral squeamishness rather than a physical cowardliness, although it is quite possible for the same person to be both <I><FONT color=brown>pusillanimous</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>cowardly</FONT></I>. What chiefly distinguishes the pusillanimous person, however, is his unwillingness to press for his right: His <I><FONT color=brown>pusillanimous</FONT></I> reaction was to sigh and say, "Well, it really won’t do to make a fuss."</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Afraid">AFRAID</A>, <A href="entry://Timid">TIMID</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bold">BOLD</A>, <A href="entry://Brave">BRAVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words apply to the active, exploratory mind and to its products, describing creators or creations that employ ordinary materials in extraordinary ways. <B><FONT color=blue>Creative</FONT></B> suggests the entire process whereby things that did not exist before are conceived, given form and brought to being. <B><FONT color=blue>Original</FONT></B> is more limited in scope and more specific, pointing to the creator not as maker but as source. The <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I> mind, slipping free of the conventional and the commonplace, comes up with things no one else has thought of ?the new idea, the different approach: an <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I> insight; a highly <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I> poet. The <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> mind goes further, combining the fruits of experience and imagination in an <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I> way to recreate reality in a new form: the <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> process; a mind in <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> ferment.</P><P>Where <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I> describe the mind, <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>imaginative</FONT></B> have to do with the imagination. Great literary works are produced by the <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> imagination; but the creators of such works and the works themselves are called <I><FONT color=brown>imaginative</FONT></I>, not <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>imaginative</FONT></I> writers; <I><FONT color=brown>imaginative</FONT></I> literature. <I><FONT color=brown>Creative</FONT></I>, when applied to people and what they do, makes an elementary distinction. The <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> people in an advertising agency are the artists and writers, as distinguished from the bookkeepers and businessmen. <I><FONT color=brown>Creative</FONT></I> writing is the writing of fiction or poetry, as distinguished from the writing of fact or opinion. But the word <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> is also used pretentiously in advertising lingo to mean novel, new or different: <I><FONT color=brown>creative</FONT></I> hair styling.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Imaginative</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>inventive</FONT></B> are alike in indicating an active fancy, a nimble exercise of mind; and both words apply to works that are strikingly original. But where the <I><FONT color=brown>imaginative</FONT></I> person may visualize things very different from reality, the <I><FONT color=brown>inventive</FONT></I> person works out how to put things together in a new way so that they will function. Inventiveness is a practical kind of creativity. It calls into play analytical qualities of mind, often in the service of a common-sense idea of what is needed.</P><P>The <B><FONT color=blue>resourceful</FONT></B> mind solves it problems despite limitations, finding whatever means are available and adapting them to its ends. Where an <I><FONT color=brown>inventive</FONT></I> mind poses its own problems, a <I><FONT color=brown>resourceful</FONT></I> mind copes with externally imposed problems. [The <I><FONT color=brown>resourceful</FONT></I> Scarlett O扝ara made a ball gown from her curtains.] An <I><FONT color=brown>imaginative</FONT></I> child may express himself by drawing. An <I><FONT color=brown>inventive</FONT></I> child may do wonders with a Meccano set. A <I><FONT color=brown>resourceful</FONT></I> child may drape an old sheet over a card table to make his own private cubby-house. Imposed limitations are not always implied. Faced with the same abundance of toys, one child still might become easily bored; a <I><FONT color=brown>resourceful</FONT></I> child, by contrast, might soon begin to develop new games, using untried combinations of these elements.</P><P>The <B><FONT color=blue>ingenious</FONT></B> person is both <I><FONT color=brown>inventive</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>resourceful</FONT></I>, but above all, he is brilliantly clever. <I><FONT color=brown>Ingenious</FONT></I> may, in fact, sometimes suggest superficial cleverness indulged in for its own sake, without a cause.

<P>These words refer to the articles of faith on which a group of adherents, as to a religion, are agreed. <B><FONT color=blue>Creed</FONT></B> most specifically refers to a concise statement of the essential points to which all believers must subscribe: the Athanasian <I><FONT color=brown>creed</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Doctrine</FONT></B> suggests a particular stand that may be briefly summarized but which usually can involve complex or extensive theological discussion for full treatment: the easily affirmed doctrine of the Trinity to which so many church fathers devoted at least a volume of explanation. The word may also refer to any item that makes up a <I><FONT color=brown>creed</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>doctrine</FONT></I> of the Resurrection. By extension, the word can also sometimes refer, in other fields, to views generally subscribed to: the Keynesian economic <I><FONT color=brown>doctrine</FONT></I> of stimulating growth through the unbalanced budget.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dogma</FONT></B> refers to an authoritative stand or a body of such stands that all believers must accept as correct. A <I><FONT color=brown>dogma</FONT></I>, however, need not be of such first-rank importance as to be part of a religion’s <I><FONT color=brown>creed</FONT></I>; it best suggests, in fact, an accretion of moral stands that have become institutionalized by time into an inflexible set of rules for the living of life: the shattering of worn-out <I><FONT color=brown>dogma</FONT></I> during the Reformation and Counter Reformation. By extension, the word refers to any set of unquestioned assertions or attitudes in any field: Maoist <I><FONT color=brown>dogma</FONT></I> that branded the Soviet Union as a betrayer of the revolution. <B><FONT color=blue>Tenet</FONT></B> refers to an attitude, principle or precept that may or may not be part of a body of <I><FONT color=brown>dogma</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>doctrine</FONT></I>. In any case, tenet suggests something more provisional in nature than these other words and thus more susceptible to change: holding to the <I><FONT color=brown>tenet</FONT></I> that the best officers are those who come up through the ranks.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Idea">IDEA</A>, <A href="entry://Opinion">OPINION</A>, <A href="entry://Religion">RELIGION</A>.</P>

<P>These words pertain to the breaking of a law. <B><FONT color=blue>Crime</FONT></B> refers specifically to serious misconduct, <B><FONT color=blue>violation</FONT></B> specifically to lesser breaches of regulation; <B><FONT color=blue>offence</FONT></B> generically includes both kinds of law-breaking: slums rife with theft, murder and other <I><FONT color=brown>crimes</FONT></I>; a traffic <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I>; a motorist who repeats the minor <I><FONT color=brown>offence</FONT></I> of illegal parking and, by ignoring the bookings, becomes guilty of a major <I><FONT color=brown>offence</FONT></I>; a light sentence because it was a first <I><FONT color=brown>offence</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Crime</FONT></I> may be used as an abstract noun to suggest all illegal activity: a mogul of organized <I><FONT color=brown>crime</FONT></I>. It may be used hyperbolically to mean any misjudgement: It’s a <I><FONT color=brown>crime</FONT></I> to waste your money on such a movie. It may also imply a breach of a moral standards: a <I><FONT color=brown>crime</FONT></I> against nature; a <I><FONT color=brown>crime</FONT></I> against humanity. Outside the legal context, <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> may suggest a breaking of faith or the rape or desecration of something held sacred: the <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of a confidence; a <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of the test-ban treaty; soldiers responsible for the widespread <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of the captured city’s women; the <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of holy relics. <I><FONT color=brown>Offence</FONT></I>, outside the legal context, may suggest extremely bad taste or injury to someone’s sensibility: a film so ribald as to give <I><FONT color=brown>offence</FONT></I>.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Crime</FONT></I> commonly subdivided into two categories ?<B><FONT color=blue>misdemeanours</FONT></B>, the less serious, and <B><FONT color=blue>felonies</FONT></B>, the more serious <I><FONT color=brown>offences</FONT></I>. The line between <I><FONT color=brown>misdemeanour</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>felony</FONT></I> is arbitrarily set by tradition or law. Severity of sentence may also be a determining factor. <B><FONT color=blue>Treason</FONT></B> is distinct in kind rather than degree from <I><FONT color=brown>misdemeanour</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>felony</FONT></I>; it involves a deliberate betrayal of one’s country to an enemy, whether in peace or war. Of these three words, only <I><FONT color=brown>treason</FONT></I> is occasionally used in other than its legal sense. In this case it refers to some monstrous desecration or ethical <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I>: Nazi doctors whose experiments constituted moral <I><FONT color=brown>treason</FONT></I> against our most deeply ingrained human instincts. During periods of heated political controversy, <I><FONT color=brown>treason</FONT></I> is often used loosely to describe any act deemed unpatriotic or damaging to the national interest: In my book, burning our flag is an act of <I><FONT color=brown>treason</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Mischievous">MISCHIEVOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Sin">SIN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: benefaction, good deed, service.</P>

<P>These words pertain to harsh or harmful acts that inflict pain on others or to inhumane temperaments and attitudes that are lacking in sensitivity or compassion. <B><FONT color=blue>Cruel</FONT></B> can apply to both the act and the attitude: the <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I> way he mistreated the helpless child; <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I> and vicious prison warders. While the word can suggest the gratuitous or unmotivated infliction of pain, <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I> is also used to describe situations where punishment may be deserved or thought desirable, but is meted out unjustly or excessively: a constitutional ban on <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I> and unusual punishment; a <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I> and repressive régime. But the word can also apply to anything that causes pain or harm, even where all intent to hurt or punish is absent: the <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I> sea; the <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I>, inexorable forces of nature. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>sadistic</FONT></B> always implies a deliberate wish to cause pain </P><P>and even more specifically focuses on inflicting it for its own sake rather than out of necessity or as punishment. The word suggests a warped mind that gets pleasure from seeing or causing other living things to suffer: the disturbed child who tore butterflies apart with <I><FONT color=brown>sadistic</FONT></I> gusto; a <I><FONT color=brown>sadistic</FONT></I> man who got sexual release only from flogging his female partner. Such pleasure often masquerades itself in the guise of meting out necessary discipline or authorized punishment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brutal</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bestial</FONT></B> both compare <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I> behaviour to that of animals. <I><FONT color=brown>Brutal</FONT></I> emphasizes a lack of sensitivity or compassion and can suggest a gross and unintelligent person given to the use of excessive and indiscriminate force in attaining his objective: Many a movie mogul reached the top by trampling on others in the most <I><FONT color=brown>brutal</FONT></I> way. By contrast, it is possible to be both clever and <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I>; also, the <I><FONT color=brown>sadistic</FONT></I> mentality may contrive intricate ways of inflicting pain. <I><FONT color=brown>Brutal</FONT></I> alone stresses sheer, savage force. Because of this, <I><FONT color=brown>brutal</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I>, can be used to refer to non-human actions, especially those that are harsh or energetic. The ship was beleaguered by the <I><FONT color=brown>brutal</FONT></I> pounding of the violent storm. <I><FONT color=brown>Bestial</FONT></I> is applied exclusively to humans; it does not point solely to forcefulness as does <I><FONT color=brown>brutal</FONT></I> nor necessarily to the inflicting of pain like the first pair. It indicates, instead, any sort of behaviour that is thought unworthy of a human being because of its depravity, degeneracy or viciousness: the <I><FONT color=brown>bestial</FONT></I> society that gave rise to Auschwitz and Treblinka. In a related use, the word can apply to unrestrained or unnatural appetite of any sort: the <I><FONT color=brown>bestial</FONT></I> lust he felt for his own daughter. As Mark Twain pointed out, it may well be inaccurate to call <I><FONT color=brown>cruel</FONT></I> behaviour <I><FONT color=brown>bestial</FONT></I>, since most animals inflict pain only out of such necessities as hunger and self-defence, whereas man has often been known to do so gratuitously.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Nasty</FONT></B> is the mildest of these words; at its most informal it can describe anything that is severe, serious or harmful: a <I><FONT color=brown>nasty</FONT></I> cut. Used of behaviour, it points to extreme unkindness or callousness and not necessarily to inflicting physical pain at all: She told him that she wouldn’t put up with his <I><FONT color=brown>nasty</FONT></I> remarks any longer. In describing personality, it can point to an extremely disagreeable temperament or to a habitual mistreatment of other: He woke up in a <I><FONT color=brown>nasty</FONT></I> frame of mind; a <I><FONT color=brown>nasty</FONT></I> man who treated other people like dirt.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Depraved">DEPRAVED</A>, <A href="entry://Hostile">HOSTILE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: gentle, <A href="entry://Humane">HUMANE</A>, kind, merciful.</P>

<P>These words refer to the denouncing of something or the calling down of evil on someone. <B><FONT color=blue>Curse</FONT></B> is the only relatively informal word here and the one most widely used in a variety of ways. Most informally, it can refer to any blasphemous oath or example of profanity, but more pertinent here, it suggests the denunciation of someone in whatever terms: <I><FONT color=brown>cursing</FONT></I> her for being an unfaithful wife. Behind this use lies the more specific situation of appealing to a supernatural power to punish a wrongdoer or enemy: King Lear’s calling upon the gods to <I><FONT color=brown>curse</FONT></I> his ungrateful daughters. The word can also pertain to any condition seen as a handicap or misfortune: the <I><FONT color=brown>curse</FONT></I> of being a woman in a man’s world. Behind this use lies the more specific situation of seeing the occurrence of some affliction as a punishment sent by fate: arguing that his misfortunes were a <I><FONT color=brown>curse</FONT></I> of his inconstancy.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Execration</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>imprecation</FONT></B> are more formal substitutes for <I><FONT color=brown>curse</FONT></I> in the sense of denouncing or calling down harm upon someone. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>execration</FONT></I> is the more intense, suggesting greater violence and loathing; his <I><FONT color=brown>execration</FONT></I> of his son’s misbehaviour before the whole family. The word can also refer to the denunciations themselves: the columnist’s predictable <I><FONT color=brown>execrations</FONT></I> of the party in power. <I><FONT color=brown>Imprecation</FONT></I> derives from a Latin word meaning to pray and this was reflected in a now obsolete use of the word for any sort of praying. More recently, the word points exclusively to the expressing of wishes or hopes that someone will meet with misfortune. This may be expressed verbally or in thought only, but the word suggests a private, even guarded expression to oneself of ill wishes, rather than the face-to-face denunciation of the person involved, as suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>execration</FONT></I>: muttering <I><FONT color=brown>imprecations</FONT></I> to himself against his mother-in-law; voodoo <I><FONT color=brown>imprecations</FONT></I> conducted in secret and employing wax dolls through which pins are stuck.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Malediction</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>anathema</FONT></B> are the most formal of these words. Where <I><FONT color=brown>execration</FONT></I> can refer to a face-to-face attack and <I><FONT color=brown>imprecation</FONT></I> to a completely solitary expression of ill-will, both these words refer most often to public denunciation expressed to arouse general disapproval. <I><FONT color=brown>Malediction</FONT></I> compares with its opposite, benediction, and may similarly suggest a formalized, ritual or clerical denunciation: priestly <I><FONT color=brown>maledictions</FONT></I> against heresy within the church; a full-page ad taken by university professors to present their <I><FONT color=brown>malediction</FONT></I> against the government’s foreign policy. Its public nature can be seen in that the word is sometimes used as a synonym for slander: spreading unfounded <I><FONT color=brown>maledictions</FONT></I> that amounted to a character assassination of his ex-colleague. <I><FONT color=brown>Anathema</FONT></I> at its most specific refers to a formal ecclesiastical ban or <I><FONT color=brown>curse</FONT></I>, in which a person is excommunicated or a book or idea is condemned: pronouncing an <I><FONT color=brown>anathema</FONT></I> against the teachings of psychoanalysis. More generally, the word can refer to anything disliked or detested by anyone: explaining that his old crony was now <I><FONT color=brown>anathema</FONT></I> to him.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Profanity">PROFANITY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: benediction, blessing.</P>

<P>These words refer to giving less than full attention or effort to a demanding task. <B><FONT color=blue>Cursory</FONT></B>, the most formal of these words, is also both the most specific and most inclusive, as well, referring to a deliberately rushed or shallow treatment: rejecting the manuscript after a <I><FONT color=brown>cursory</FONT></I> glance at it; only a <I><FONT color=brown>cursory</FONT></I> attempt to keep in mind the requirements of his clients. The other words here all emphasize one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>cursory</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Careless</FONT></B> suggests that the poor performance results from sloppiness and inattention to details: so <I><FONT color=brown>careless</FONT></I> as to render her best efforts <I><FONT color=brown>cursory</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Hasty</FONT></B>, by contrast, emphasizes a refusal or inability to spend the time necessary to a more adequate performance: after a <I><FONT color=brown>hasty</FONT></I> thumbing through the pamphlet of instruction; a <I><FONT color=brown>hasty</FONT></I> consideration of the merits of the case. <I><FONT color=brown>Slapdash</FONT></I> approaches <I><FONT color=brown>cursory</FONT></I> in inclusiveness since it combines the implication of both <I><FONT color=brown>careless</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>hasty</FONT></I>, suggesting a sloppy, rushed performance: trying to work from a <I><FONT color=brown>slapdash</FONT></I> sketch instead of a painstakingly executed blueprint.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Superficial</FONT></B> limits <I><FONT color=brown>cursory</FONT></I> to a refusal or inability to look into the deeper meanings or complexities of something: a <I><FONT color=brown>superficial</FONT></I> analysis of the poem; <I><FONT color=brown>superficial</FONT></I> competence that could hardly face any serious challenge. <I><FONT color=brown>Superficial</FONT></I> is in sharp contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>careless</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>hasty</FONT></I>, since one might give adequate care and time to an effort and still come up with a <I><FONT color=brown>superficial</FONT></I> result. Most often in fact, <I><FONT color=brown>superficial</FONT></I> suggests an inability to do better and thus contrasts with all these words when they imply a deliberate refusal to meet the demands of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Scant</FONT></B>, in this context, refers specifically to brevity of effort: paying <I><FONT color=brown>scant</FONT></I> attention to his class assignments. This word differs from <I><FONT color=brown>hasty</FONT></I>, however, in emphasizing a short amount of time rather than work done too rapidly. One might have a great deal of time and still do <I><FONT color=brown>hasty</FONT></I> work; conversely, one might work methodically in the <I><FONT color=brown>scant</FONT></I> time allotted a task. Only in <I><FONT color=brown>cursory</FONT></I> are both the tendencies necessarily combined.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Neglect">NEGLECT</A>, <A href="entry://Scanty">SCANTY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Careful">CAREFUL</A>, minute, painstaking, profound, searching, thorough.</P>

<P>These words refer to things that are commonplace or that occur every twenty-four hours or during daylight. <B><FONT color=blue>Daily</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>everyday</FONT></B> are the most informal of these. <I><FONT color=brown>Daily</FONT></I> refers most specifically to something that occurs once every twenty-four hours: a <I><FONT color=brown>daily</FONT></I> newspaper; a tantrum that was almost a <I><FONT color=brown>daily</FONT></I> occurrence. It may also refer to things that inevitably occur each day, regardless of number. Give us this day our <I><FONT color=brown>daily</FONT></I> bread. It may even suggest things accounted for by the day or things that differ from one day to the next: a <I><FONT color=brown>daily</FONT></I> record of expenditures; restaurants that have daily menus. Everyday, by contrast, refers almost exclusively to anything usual or ordinary, whether or not it can be strictly said to occur once every twenty-four hours: the <I><FONT color=brown>everyday</FONT></I> life of the town. More specifically it refers to things appropriate for ordinary, humble occasions rather than for special events: <I><FONT color=brown>everyday</FONT></I> clothes.

It can indicate something that occurs daily: a <I><FONT color=brown>quotidian</FONT></I> fever. <I><FONT color=brown>Diurnal</FONT></I> suggests something that goes through its cycle of changes once every twenty-four hours: the <I><FONT color=brown>diurnal</FONT></I> motion of the stars.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Temporary">TEMPORARY</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: nightly, nocturnal, <A href="entry://Unparalleled">UNPARALLELED</A>, <A href="entry://Unusual">UNUSUAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the possibility of harm or destruction. <B><FONT color=blue>Danger</FONT></B>, the most general of these, can refer to any situation that confronts one with an undesirable or injurious eventuality: He had stayed up so late that he was in <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I> of oversleeping and being late for word; discussions to reduce the <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I> of a military confrontation between the two nations. The word is a familiar warning on road signs. [<I><FONT color=brown>Danger</FONT></I>, Winding road.] As in the last example, <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I> often suggests a difficulty that can still be avoided through forethought. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>peril</FONT></B> exclusively points only to grave <I><FONT color=brown>dangers</FONT></I> and may sometimes suggest a worsening situation that can no longer be averted by the use of forethought alone: Many species are already in <I><FONT color=brown>peril</FONT></I> of extinction because of our destruction of their natural habitat. More broadly, the word can suggest the unpredictable <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I> that must be faced in pursuing a course of action: the great perils that the earliest Arcitc explorers confronted.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Risk</FONT></B> is related to this last use of <I><FONT color=brown>peril</FONT></I>, but is more general and can indicate less extreme or imminent <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I>. At its most specific, it indicates the chance of misfortune that accompanies an act undertaken in hope of gain or benefit: a business insured against the <I><FONT color=brown>risk</FONT></I> of failure. Here, the negative possibilities can to some extent be foreseen and weighted against the possibility of success: a calculated risk. <B><FONT color=blue>Hazard</FONT></B> can function as a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>risk</FONT></I>, though it may suggest that greater danger attends the action. In this, it combines the gravity of <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I> suggested by peril with the weighing or taking of chances suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>risk</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>hazards</FONT></I> of mountain climbing. The word can also function as a hyperbole for the predictable liabilities in any situation: He braced himself for the <I><FONT color=brown>hazards</FONT></I> of an evening spent with his mother-in-law. It is also commonly used to refer to taking an unwise <I><FONT color=brown>risk</FONT></I>: Storing petrol in garage is a fire <I><FONT color=brown>hazard</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Jeopardy</FONT></B> can substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>risk</FONT></I> at an even greater level of formality than <I><FONT color=brown>hazard</FONT></I>. It now mainly appears in the phrase in <I><FONT color=brown>jeopardy</FONT></I>: Such a gamble against odds would put their whole venture in <I><FONT color=brown>jeopardy</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Threat</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>menace</FONT></B> can both refer not <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I> inevitably accompanying an act but to a malevolent or coercive <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I> independent or external to oneself: an escaped psychopath who became a <I><FONT color=brown>menace</FONT></I> to the community. <I><FONT color=brown>Menace</FONT></I> suggests the possibility of violence or destruction and points to a graver <I><FONT color=brown>danger</FONT></I> than any of these words except <I><FONT color=brown>peril</FONT></I>. The word can also refer more emphatically than <I><FONT color=brown>hazard</FONT></I> to something that represents an unwise <I><FONT color=brown>risk</FONT></I>: a rickety stairway that was a <I><FONT color=brown>menace</FONT></I> to life and limb. <I><FONT color=brown>Threat</FONT></I> is milder than <I><FONT color=brown>menace</FONT></I> and much more general. Most concretely, it can indicate an expressed intention to harm: a <I><FONT color=brown>threat</FONT></I> against the witness’s life; a <I><FONT color=brown>threat</FONT></I> to expose him unless he continued to work for the gang. More generally, the word can indicate a situation or act that puts something in danger: provocations that were a <I><FONT color=brown>threat</FONT></I> to peace.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Precarious">PRECARIOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: defence, <A href="entry://Protection">PROTECTION</A>, safeguard, safety, security.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>daring</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>adventurous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>venturesome</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>venturous</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a fearless willingness to take risks. <B><FONT color=blue>Daring</FONT></B> stresses bold, decisive, forceful or startling acts that set the performer apart and that may be viewed with awe or fear: a <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I> trapezist. Usually, the word implies admirable fortitude, cool-headed proficiency in the face of danger, or an unusual or original approach: a <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I> foray into enemy territory; a <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I> proposal to eliminate slums. Often the word is favourable and implies the successful execution of an action: a <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I> novel and implies the successful execution of an action: a <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I> novel brilliantly executed. Sometimes the word is used as a euphemism for risqué or salacious: <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I> photos of nude models. <B><FONT color=blue>Adventurous</FONT></B> indicates a habit of mind that is interested in exploring the new or untried, but the word gives fewer implications about the manner of execution. In this it is more general, being as applicable to a more relaxed or casual approach as to the decisive forcefulness indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>adventurous</FONT></I> mind that could painstakingly digest vast areas of new knowledge. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I> more often implies a single or specific goal, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>adventurous</FONT></I> can point to a general curiosity or zest for exploration: a <I><FONT color=brown>daring</FONT></I> manoeuvre; <I><FONT color=brown>adventurous</FONT></I> students out on a prank ready to try anything.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Venturesome</FONT></B> also concentrates more on single or specific goals, but is otherwise less rich than daring in its implication. It can suggest a canny ?even prudent ?weighing of odds before action, however unconventional the action itself may be: a <I><FONT color=brown>venturesome</FONT></I> gamble with new shares that paid off on the market largely because of the investor’s shrewdness. <B><FONT color=blue>Venturous</FONT></B> is now less common in use, pointing to the taking of risks, but with no necessary implications of shrewdness or decisiveness: a <I><FONT color=brown>venturous</FONT></I> fellow who had at least learnt to roll with the blows.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bold">BOLD</A>, <A href="entry://Brave">BRAVE</A>, <A href="entry://Opportunistic">OPPORTUNISTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Reckless">RECKLESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cautious">CAUTIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Cowardly">COWARDLY</A>, <A href="entry://Timid">TIMID</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to something that is no longer in existence. <B><FONT color=blue>Dead</FONT></B> refers, most concretely, to any once-living thing that has died: his <I><FONT color=brown>dead</FONT></I> rabbit; a <I><FONT color=brown>dead</FONT></I> tree. It can even refer to anything that no longer functions: a <I><FONT color=brown>dead</FONT></I> battery. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>deceased</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>departed</FONT></B> are exclusively restricted in reference to <I><FONT color=brown>dead</FONT></I> people. <I><FONT color=brown>Deceased</FONT></I> is a legal term that seems euphemistic in any other context, although it sometimes appears in ordinary use. <I><FONT color=brown>Departed</FONT></I>, by contrast, would strike many as a euphemism for <I><FONT color=brown>dead</FONT></I>; it is meant to be delicate by suggesting that the <I><FONT color=brown>dead</FONT></I> person has gone to a better world. Compared to <I><FONT color=brown>departed</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>dead</FONT></I> is simple, dignified, and universally unoffending.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Defunct</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>extinct</FONT></B> contrast with the foregoing by not referring to the death of a living individual at all (except for comic effect). Although <I><FONT color=brown>defunct</FONT></I> could with all seriousness once be used of a <I><FONT color=brown>dead</FONT></I> person, it now applies mainly to the lapsing or closing down of non-living things: a <I><FONT color=brown>defunct</FONT></I> literary magazine; an anthropomorphic attitude that is now <I><FONT color=brown>defunct</FONT></I> in the biological sciences; a <I><FONT color=brown>defunct</FONT></I> restaurant. <I><FONT color=brown>Extinct</FONT></I> refers to the lapsing of a whole species or line of individuals: when the brontosaurus became <I><FONT color=brown>extinct</FONT></I>; a family name that became <I><FONT color=brown>extinct</FONT></I> when the only heir died without issue.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lifeless</FONT></B> has a wide range of uses from the literal to the lyrical: <I><FONT color=brown>lifeless</FONT></I> inorganic compounds; dawn lighting the <I><FONT color=brown>lifeless</FONT></I> streets of the city. When used of someone dead, the implication may be of a recent death: staring down at his <I><FONT color=brown>lifeless</FONT></I> face on the pillow.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Corpse">CORPSE</A>, <A href="entry://Die">DIE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: existent <A href="entry://Living">LIVING</A>.</P>

<P>These words pertain to the use of misrepresentation to win the trust or approval of others. <B><FONT color=blue>Deception</FONT></B> has the widest range of uses; at its mildest, the word can suggest a necessary or inconsequential misrepresentation: She referred to the pills as sweets, a harmless <I><FONT color=brown>deception</FONT></I> that made it easier to administer them to the child. At its most disapproving the word can point to selfish dishonesty: a candidate who prectised all kinds of <I><FONT color=brown>deception</FONT></I> on the voters to win their confidence. <B><FONT color=blue>Deceit</FONT></B>, which is wholly negative in tone, is considerably harsher than <I><FONT color=brown>deception</FONT></I> in its disapproval. It can suggest a habitual liar or schemer or refer to an involved plan to take advantage of someone else: the flagrant <I><FONT color=brown>deceit</FONT></I> by which he kept his wife from knowing about the affair. Where <I><FONT color=brown>deceit</FONT></I> often stresses the dishonesty of one person to another, <B><FONT color=blue>fraud</FONT></B> more often points to a complex, more impersonal system for cheating all comers or the public at large. It often suggests official dishonesty or financial malfeasance: a land-development <I><FONT color=brown>fraud</FONT></I> that bankrupted a dozen elderly couples. Sometimes the word is used hyperbolically for anything one finds utterly worthless: That play was a total <I><FONT color=brown>fraud</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Equivocation</FONT></B> is most closely related to the mildest sense of <I><FONT color=brown>deception</FONT></I>, but can be even less severe, since it need indicate no intent to deceive. Instead, it points to an evasive or pussyfooting approach: Her <I><FONT color=brown>equivocations</FONT></I> sometimes seemed to be nothing more than a reluctance to give him a straight yes or no answer. In some case, the word is used as a mere euphemism for a lie: He denied having lied to her, although he admitted that he had been guilty of an <I><FONT color=brown>equivocation</FONT></I> or two. <B><FONT color=blue>Trickery</FONT></B> points less to verbal misrepresentation alone than to the deliberate giving of false appearances. It is milder in its disapproval than <I><FONT color=brown>deceit</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fraud</FONT></I>, although it can apply to either personal or public behaviour. <I><FONT color=brown>Trickery</FONT></I> is a harsher term than deception, however, in suggesting the selfish seeking of gain, often by means of a systematic scheme: the <I><FONT color=brown>trickery</FONT></I> they practised on their fair-weather friends in order seem richer and more famous than they were; He had gained control of the company by <I><FONT color=brown>trickery</FONT></I> in manipulating the proxy votes entrusted to him. While <B><FONT color=blue>chicanery</FONT></B> suggests less serious offences than do <I><FONT color=brown>trickery</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fraud</FONT></I>, the word adds a note of disgust for shoddy methods: Press agents for film stars will stoop to any kind of <I><FONT color=brown>chicanery</FONT></I> to get their clients publicity.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheat">CHEAT</A>, <A href="entry://Guile">GUILE</A>, <A href="entry://Trick">TRICK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: candour, frankness, honesty, sincerity, veracity.</P>

decide
<B><FONT color=blue>decide</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>determine</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>resolve</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>settle</FONT></B>:

<P>These words pertain to the reaching of conclusions. <B><FONT color=blue>Decide</FONT></B> stresses the making of a choice, regardless of how it is arrived at: jurors who have already <I><FONT color=brown>decided</FONT></I> what to think before hearing a shred of evidence; an investigative committee that took months to sift testimony and decide if new legislation should be drafted. Sometimes a conclusive factor may be the subject: Above all, it was his earnestness that <I><FONT color=brown>decided</FONT></I> her. Using a passive construction is often thought to make the conclusion seem more objective, impassive and official: It was <I><FONT color=brown>decided</FONT></I> at our meeting to abolish the honour system of borrowing from the library.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Settle</FONT></B> is considerably more forceful than <I><FONT color=brown>decide</FONT></I>, pointing exclusively to the reaching of a definite or final choice after a period of indecision or dispute: a new hearing to <I><FONT color=brown>settle</FONT></I> the question once and for all; He had considered a number of jobs before <I><FONT color=brown>settle</FONT></I> on a career in advertising. With for, the word can indicate a reluctant or compromise choice: They had wanted to spend a week in Rome, but <I><FONT color=brown>settled</FONT></I> for a few days. A related context for <B><FONT color=blue>determine</FONT></B> pertains to investigation or discovery; here, in reference to choice, the word still implies thoughtful or searching consideration: She asked him for help in <I><FONT color=brown>determining</FONT></I> where to hang the pictures in her new flat. The force of the word changes considerably when it is used as a past participle to express a decisive choice, purpose or conviction: He was <I><FONT color=brown>determined</FONT></I> to win the game. <B><FONT color=blue>Resolve</FONT></B> is closely related in meaning to this one sense of <I><FONT color=brown>determine</FONT></I>, referring to an even greater conviction or purpose with which something is <I><FONT color=brown>decided</FONT></I>. [He <I><FONT color=brown>resolved</FONT></I> to clear his father’s name; She was <I><FONT color=brown>resolved</FONT></I> to become a ballet dancer.] The word can also refer to the <I><FONT color=brown>settling</FONT></I> of a question by a group, most often after debate: The clerical staff <I><FONT color=brown>resolved</FONT></I> to lodge a protest against the new award. More generally, the word can refer, like one use of <I><FONT color=brown>decide</FONT></I>, to something that is conclusive: means to <I><FONT color=brown>resolve</FONT></I> the questions surrounding the assassination.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Consider">CONSIDER</A>, <A href="entry://Find">FIND</A>, <A href="entry://Judge">JUDGE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: fluctuate, <A href="entry://Hesitate">HESITATE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the releasing of information or rulings in official or public ways. More informally, <B><FONT color=blue>declare</FONT></B> can relate simply to forceful or direct assertion: She <I><FONT color=brown>declared</FONT></I> that she didn’t want to see him again. This possible implication of forcefulness may or may not be present when the word applies to official rulings. [The judges <I><FONT color=brown>declared</FONT></I> the contest a tie; The military police <I><FONT color=brown>declared</FONT></I> the hotel out of bounds.] In any case, the word here emphasizes an authoritative utterance.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Announce</FONT></B> pertains almost exclusively to public or official statements, but these can be <I><FONT color=brown>declared</FONT></I> in any medium and they may be informative as well as authoritative decisions. [He called a press conference to announce his candidacy; They <I><FONT color=brown>announced</FONT></I> to the assembled guests that they were engaged to be married. The officials <I><FONT color=brown>announced</FONT></I> new rules to cover the championship bout.] On an informal level, <B><FONT color=blue>proclaim</FONT></B> can indicate the <I><FONT color=brown>declaring</FONT></I> of a considered and definite decision or judgement: She proclaimed the dress to be too daring for her personality. Pertaining to official utterance, the word stresses extreme formality: the ceremony at which he would officially be <I><FONT color=brown>proclaimed</FONT></I> archbishop. The word can also indicate resolute conviction: I <I><FONT color=brown>proclaim</FONT></I> the honourable member’s statement to be a complete falsehood. <B><FONT color=blue>Enunciate</FONT></B> carries over its reference to clear speech when it applies to official statements, since here it stresses the careful but authoritative spelling out of detailed rules or doctrine: the pope who first <I><FONT color=brown>enunciated</FONT></I> the doctrine of the Assumption of the Virgin.</P><P>The remaining words all now pertain primarily to the dissemination of information through various communication media. <B><FONT color=blue>Publish</FONT></B> pertains to books, magazines, newspapers and other printed media. <B><FONT color=blue>Broadcast</FONT></B> once referred merely to making something known far and wide, but more often now it pertains to anything programmed on radio or television or announced over a public-address system. <B><FONT color=blue>Advertise</FONT></B> now indicates a paid presentation to win popularity for a product or candidate. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>publish</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I>, however, <I><FONT color=brown>advertise</FONT></I> can suggest every conceivable medium in which paid messages can appear.

<P>These words refer to a lessening in numbers, intensity or volume. <B><FONT color=blue>Decrease</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dwindle</FONT></B> can both be applied widely but are particularly pertinent to a reduction in numbers. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>decrease</FONT></I> is the more general and has fewer connotations. [In winter, the number of arrests generally <I><FONT color=brown>decrease</FONT></I>; The number of nations allied with us <I><FONT color=brown>decreased</FONT></I> as the war continued.] Where <I><FONT color=brown>decrease</FONT></I> can apply as well to a reduction in undesirable things, <I><FONT color=brown>dwindle</FONT></I> usually suggests a loss of something valuable; the word often gives a lyrical or elegiac tone and can suggest a wasting process. [Sanctuaries for wildlife have <I><FONT color=brown>dwindled</FONT></I> alarmingly in the last decade; His health <I><FONT color=brown>dwindled</FONT></I> slowly day by day.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>subside</FONT></B> both point to a slow reduction in intensity: The ferocity of the enemy’s counter attack <I><FONT color=brown>abated</FONT></I> after the first few hours. <I><FONT color=brown>Subside</FONT></I> can in particular suggest a return to clam or repose after agitation: a violent struggle after which he <I><FONT color=brown>subsided</FONT></I> into a feverish sleep. Like one possibility for <I><FONT color=brown>dwindle</FONT></I>, both these words are often applied to a slow loss of strength or health.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Decline</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sink</FONT></B> are particularly relevant to a reduction in volume. <I><FONT color=brown>Decline</FONT></I> is more neutral and factual, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>sink</FONT></I> can give a lyrical or elegiac tone. While both can apply to illness, both also can refer factually to the gradual reduction in the measurable level of something: The volume of shares traded <I><FONT color=brown>declined</FONT></I> as prices continued to sink throughout the day. Both refer metaphorically to a downward trend, but <I><FONT color=brown>sink</FONT></I> is more graphic here can suggest a more drastic or quicker movement: daylight that declined almost infinitesimally at first and then <I><FONT color=brown>sank</FONT></I> away rapidly when the sun had set. <I><FONT color=brown>Sink</FONT></I> is relatively-informal when compared to the previous words.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Drop</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>fall</FONT></B> both concentrate on a sudden downward movement or a reduction in numbers, intensity or volume. Both, like <I><FONT color=brown>sink</FONT></I>, are relatively informal. A possible distinction between the two exists in that drop might more naturally describe reduction and <I><FONT color=brown>fall</FONT></I> an unfortunate eradication programme; The standard of debate <I><FONT color=brown>fell</FONT></I> to a new low, with name-calling and denunciation replacing rational discourse.] When <I><FONT color=brown>fall</FONT></I> in used with off, the word applies more generally to any decline, slow or rapid, good or bad: Unemployment continued to <I><FONT color=brown>fall</FONT></I> off in the third quarter.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Reduce">REDUCE</A>, <A href="entry://Wane">WANE</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Climb">CLIMB</A>, <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Escalate">ESCALATE</A>, grow, strengthen, wax.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>dedicate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>consecrate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>devote</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hallow</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a resolute commitment or a bestowing of honour, credit, reverence or respect. <B><FONT color=blue>Dedicate</FONT></B> can pertain to a formal or public act in which something is metaphorically assigned to the honour or credit of someone who is not its immediate creator: He <I><FONT color=brown>dedicated</FONT></I> the book to his wife; a holiday <I><FONT color=brown>dedicated</FONT></I> to the memory of those who died in the nation’s battles. Parallel to this, a person may <I><FONT color=brown>dedicate</FONT></I> himself to a particular goal; in this case, the word stresses resolution and conviction: He <I><FONT color=brown>dedicated</FONT></I> his life to the abolition of slavery.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Devote</FONT></B> relates almost exclusively to this last sense of dedicate, but the word puts less stress on an idealistic commitment and more on something purused out of warmth, affection or personal inclination: a man <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> to his wife; a waster <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> to a life of pleasure-seeking. Even where the word approaches <I><FONT color=brown>dedicate</FONT></I> in use, a more intimate or personal note is felt: She was to <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> herself to a simple life in the service of others.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Consecrate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>hallow</FONT></B>, both relatively formal, are specifically religious in tone; at their most restricted, they suggest a ritual in which something is set aside for a sacred purpose: <I><FONT color=brown>consecrated</FONT></I> ground; <I><FONT color=brown>hallowed</FONT></I> by Thy name. Both apply outside the religious context to any extreme or solemn commitment, although here, <I><FONT color=brown>consecrate</FONT></I> possibly applies more widely; a truly great ruler who <I><FONT color=brown>consecrated</FONT></I> himself to seeking and upholding the public good; a day set aside to <I><FONT color=brown>hallow</FONT></I> the founding of the country.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Award">AWARD</A>, <A href="entry://Entrust">ENTRUST</A>, <A href="entry://Respect">RESPECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: desecrate, dishonour, profane.</P>

<P>These words agree when they mean to overcome an opponent in a competition or struggle. <B><FONT color=blue>Defeat</FONT></B>, the most general of these terms, has a wide range of applications, but does not itself connote any particular margin of victory or the ease with which it has been effected: barely <I><FONT color=brown>defeated</FONT></I> after a long, fiercely waged struggle; utterly and humiliatingly <I><FONT color=brown>defeated</FONT></I> and put to rout. Sports writers have adopted <I><FONT color=brown>defeat</FONT></I> and the other terms to their own use: All Blacks <I><FONT color=brown>defeat</FONT></I> England, 13-8.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Best</FONT></B> implies merely that one gets the better of his opponent: The secretary was <I><FONT color=brown>bested</FONT></I> by the treasurer in the controversy over the proposed increase in membership fees. <I><FONT color=brown>Best</FONT></I> has a more formal tone to it than <I><FONT color=brown>defeat</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Beat</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>defeat</FONT></I>, implies that one’s opponent is completely overcome: Achilles <I><FONT color=brown>beat</FONT></I> Hector. <I><FONT color=brown>Beat</FONT></I>, though quite often used in formal contexts, is equally at home in informal contexts, and can be used to describe any competition, however far removed from the field of physical combat: to <I><FONT color=brown>beat</FONT></I> someone at draughts. <I><FONT color=brown>Defeat</FONT></I> would sound a little pretentious in this context unless the draughts match were part of a formal competition.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lick</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>clean up</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wipe</FONT></B> are colloquial terms meaning to beat easily. <I><FONT color=brown>Lick</FONT></I> sounds a little old-fashioned and is a reminder of yesterday’s adolescents, but it is still often used as a challenge. I can <I><FONT color=brown>lick</FONT></I> any man in the room. Like <I><FONT color=brown>clean up</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>wipe</FONT></I>, it would sound misplaced in more serious contexts. The Australian Davis Cup team may <I><FONT color=brown>wipe</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>clean up</FONT></I> the challenging nation at tennis, but we could hardly say that the Allies <I><FONT color=brown>wiped</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>cleaned up</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>licked</FONT></I> the Nazis in World War II. <B><FONT color=blue>Drub</FONT></B> is more definite, if anything, than these words in implying that the <I><FONT color=brown>defeated</FONT></I> party has been so badly <I><FONT color=brown>beaten</FONT></I> that the competition was no contest; the score was lopsided, the loser humiliated. <I><FONT color=brown>Drub</FONT></I> has a meaning of to <I><FONT color=brown>beat</FONT></I> physically and retains connotations of severe punishment, suggesting satisfaction in the administration of a sound beating.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: subjugate, <A href="entry://Vanquish">VANQUISH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: give up, surrender.</P>

deficient
<B><FONT color=blue>deficient</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inadequate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>poor</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unsatisfactory</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to what is substandard or low in quality. <B><FONT color=blue>Deficient</FONT></B> is by far the most specific and exact in meaning. The word points to a lack of something that is required to accomplish a given goal or purpose; a cheque returned because of <I><FONT color=brown>deficient</FONT></I> funds; Rickets can result from a diet <I><FONT color=brown>deficient</FONT></I> in vitamin D. Usually the word does not suggest a lack that is a matter of degree but one, whether small or large, that fails to meet a minimum level of need below which something cannot function at all. Applied to aspects of character, the word suggests a flaw or failing, whether correctable or not, that makes someone unable to perform some activity: an armchair theorist <I><FONT color=brown>deficient</FONT></I> in practical experience.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Poor</FONT></B>, the least specific and most wide-ranging of all these words, applies in this context to a matter of degree rather than to a cut-off point at which something ceases to function: <I><FONT color=brown>poor</FONT></I> eating habits that, miraculously, did not result in a vitamin deficiency; anaemia that resulted from a diet <I><FONT color=brown>poor</FONT></I> in iron. <B><FONT color=blue>Inadequate</FONT></B> relates more closely to deficient in indicating a failure to meet minimal standards. <I><FONT color=brown>Deficient</FONT></I>, however, often points to a minimum that can be objectively measured whereas <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I> can point to a more subjective evaluation: <I><FONT color=brown>deficient</FONT></I> by two votes of passing the proposed legislation; a pianist whose technique seemed <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I> to the demands of the pieces he had chosen to play. But <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I> can indicate lacks that are a matter of fact rather than of taste: a water supply <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I> to the needs of the city. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>unsatisfactory</FONT></B> stresses the first sense of <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I>, pointing more to subjective evaluation than to measurable lack: The teacher informed him that he was making <I><FONT color=brown>unsatisfactory</FONT></I> progress in his studies. It can also indicate a matter of degree, like <I><FONT color=brown>poor</FONT></I>: many brilliant scenes in a ply that on the whole was <I><FONT color=brown>unsatisfactory</FONT></I>. As in the last example, the word at its most literal can refer to a failure to give satisfaction or pleasure.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Scanty">SCANTY</A>, <A href="entry://Weak">WEAK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adequate">ADEQUATE</A>, good.</P>

<P>These words refer to mental experiences that appear realistic or believable but have, despite their vividness, no objective reality. <B><FONT color=blue>Delusion</FONT></B> refers to the most extreme and inclusive form of this mental phenomenon, since it may combine vivid sensory imagery with complex notions or conceits; in the psychotic person, these <I><FONT color=brown>delusions</FONT></I> are totally mistaken for reality and are not voluntarily called up: a <I><FONT color=brown>delusion</FONT></I> that he heard voices urging him to kill; a <I><FONT color=brown>delusion</FONT></I> that he was Winston Churchill; the final stages of alcoholism in which <I><FONT color=brown>delusions</FONT></I> are commonplace. The phrase <I><FONT color=brown>delusions of grandeur</FONT></I> is actually a clinical term but is often used commonly for anyone with inflated self-regard.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fantasy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>illusion</FONT></B> are considerably less extreme than <I><FONT color=brown>delusion</FONT></I>, referring to mental activity that everyone, not just a psychotic person, has commonly experienced. <I><FONT color=brown>Fantasy</FONT></I> applies mostly to an imaginary scene, such as that in a day dream, whether called up voluntarily or not, which is acted out mentally with vivid sensory imagery, but which is not, except in the mentally ill, mistaken for reality. The word may emphasize a general tendency of imagination towards the fanciful, whimsical, surrealistic or grotesque: a <I><FONT color=brown>fantasy</FONT></I> in which he watched his parents mourning over his coffin; a delightful element of <I><FONT color=brown>fantasy</FONT></I> that makes his ghost stories chilling and also convincing. <I><FONT color=brown>Illusion</FONT></I> can refer to an ideational cluster of notions that everyone experiences, voluntarily or not, but which do not correspond to any objective view of things: under the <I><FONT color=brown>illusion</FONT></I> that he could accomplish the whole job without the help of his co-workers. Two related, but milder, uses of this word exist; one refers to the bundle of ideals or necessary lies each person maintains to buoy up his ego: an <I><FONT color=brown>illusion</FONT></I> that the society in which he lived was very near perfect; an <I><FONT color=brown>illusion</FONT></I> that he was well liked by his fellow workers. Another use of <I><FONT color=brown>illusion</FONT></I> refers to confused optical phenomena that trick the eye into seeing a situation as other than it is: Heavy fog had created an optical <I><FONT color=brown>illusion</FONT></I> that made the opposite shore seem closer than it was. <B><FONT color=blue>Mirage</FONT></B> is specifically restricted to this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>illusion</FONT></I>: a mirage that made the highway ahead seem to be flooded with water. When a person is under extreme stress, however, his inward mental disturbance may co-operate with deceptive optical clues to create something more similar to a full-blown <I><FONT color=brown>delusion</FONT></I>: gasping through lips cracked by the desert sun, he claimed that he saw a silver palace just over the next dune, unaware that the whole vision was nothing but a <I><FONT color=brown>mirage</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hallucination</FONT></B> is mainly restricted to vivid sensory experience, like <I><FONT color=brown>fantasy</FONT></I>, but in its intensity a <I><FONT color=brown>hallucination</FONT></I> approaches the believability of a <I><FONT color=brown>delusion</FONT></I>. This experience would tend to occur involuntarily to any person under certain extreme circumstances, as during a long-term fever, after heavy dosages of painkilling or other drugs, during delirium tremens, or in connection with certain physical illnesses such as brain tumours. In this sense, a <I><FONT color=brown>hallucination</FONT></I> might be most typically fleeting, like a waking dream. In other uses, however, the word may point to nervous malfunction expressive of a deep-seated mental imbalance, in which case it indicates one possible constituent of a psychotic <I><FONT color=brown>delusion</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Imagination">IMAGINATION</A>, <A href="entry://Misleading">MISLEADING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: actuality, fact, reality, truth, verity.</P>

<P>These verbs all refer to rather forceful communications between a speaker and another person. <B><FONT color=blue>Demand</FONT></B> most commonly suggests a speaker in authority who bluntly insists upon being obeyed and does not intend to be contradicted: <I><FONT color=brown>demanding</FONT></I> your compliance with all our regulations. Its forcefulness may be weakened in some uses to a less blunt insistence: a book that <I><FONT color=brown>demands</FONT></I> your full attention; to be surrendered when the bearer <I><FONT color=brown>demands</FONT></I> payment. <B><FONT color=blue>Request</FONT></B> is considerably weaker than any sense of <I><FONT color=brown>demand</FONT></I>; it suggests a courteous statement of desire: <I><FONT color=brown>requesting</FONT></I> the orchestra to play her favourite tune. The word has a special relevance here, however, in that it is more and more used as a euphemism for <I><FONT color=brown>demand</FONT></I> in order to disguise the latter’s harshness: The manger firmly <I><FONT color=brown>requested</FONT></I> the head storeman’s resignation. <B><FONT color=blue>Require</FONT></B> may suggest a stated set of rules listing necessary conduct: employers who <I><FONT color=brown>require</FONT></I> perfect punctuality and flawless performance. <I><FONT color=brown>Require</FONT></I> is like <I><FONT color=brown>demand</FONT></I> in suggesting authority and insistence, but unlike the latter in that it stresses need and may suggest an impartial code drawn up in advance. [No rational person would <I><FONT color=brown>require</FONT></I> such constant reassurances as she <I><FONT color=brown>demand</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ask</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>request</FONT></I> in depending on context for whatever overtone of harshness or force it may suggest: <I><FONT color=brown>asking</FONT></I> timidly if he might see a menu; political parties that <I><FONT color=brown>ask</FONT></I> for the complete surrender of all individuality. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>order</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>demand</FONT></I> in its peremptoriness, suggesting power and authority on the part of the person who directs someone else to do something. It is further removed than <I><FONT color=brown>demand</FONT></I>, however, from any suggestion of anger; it may be, like <I><FONT color=brown>require</FONT></I>, quite impersonal, especially in a military context. [I’m not <I><FONT color=brown>asking</FONT></I> you to fall out for drill, I’m <I><FONT color=brown>ordering</FONT></I> you.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Claim</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>exact</FONT></B> involve a slightly different situation than these other words. <I><FONT color=brown>Claim</FONT></I> suggests that a right is being asserted: <I><FONT color=brown>claiming</FONT></I> this land in the name of the Queen: unions that <I><FONT color=brown>claimed</FONT></I> a right to share in the company’s profits. <I><FONT color=brown>Exact</FONT></I> is stronger than <B><FONT color=blue>claim</FONT></B> in suggesting someone with enough authority to back up his <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I>, possibly with force, if necessary: a dictator who <I><FONT color=brown>exacts</FONT></I> grotesque extremes of obedience from his underlings. In this, it is similar to but stronger than some uses of <I><FONT color=brown>require</FONT></I>. In other uses, the word shades off, like require, into impersonality, with less suggestion of force: cities that <I><FONT color=brown>exact</FONT></I> tolls on newly built highways.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Claim">CLAIM</A>, <A href="entry://Request">REQUEST</A> (v.) <A href="entry://Request">REQUEST</A> (n.) <A href="entry://Require">REQUIRE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Forgo">FORGO</A>, <A href="entry://Relinquish">RELINQUISH</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the act of hanging back from full participation or full assent. <B><FONT color=blue>Demur</FONT></B> suggests mild dissent or personal objection, possibly in reply to a direct request: gently <I><FONT color=brown>demurring</FONT></I> to her notion of leaving the party early. It may also imply hesitation prompted by doubt or indecision: Though urged to stay to dinner, she still politely <I><FONT color=brown>demurred</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Demur</FONT></I>, in comparison with the other words in this set, might now seem too stiffly formal. <B><FONT color=blue>Scruple</FONT></B>, closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>demur</FONT></I> and only a little less formal, points specifically to hesitation or objection on moral or ethical grounds. [A single girl of that era often <I><FONT color=brown>scrupled</FONT></I> about being left alone with a gentleman; He did not <I><FONT color=brown>scruple</FONT></I> to tell lies when it served his interests.] The verb <I><FONT color=brown>scruple</FONT></I> might now especially apply to over-fussy or niggling from <B><FONT color=blue>shy</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Shy</FONT></I> emphasizes instead a skittish starting aside or squeamish holding back out of fear, doubt or caution. It thus suggests a more intense negation than <I><FONT color=brown>demur</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>scruple</FONT></I>, pointing to a reaction based less on reflection than on instinct. [The horse <I><FONT color=brown>shied</FONT></I> at the first hiss of the snake; The girl <I><FONT color=brown>shied</FONT></I> away from looking the strange man in the eye.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Recoil</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>shrink</FONT></B> relate more closely to shy than to <I><FONT color=brown>demur</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>scruple</FONT></I>. Recoil suggests a sudden springing back out of surprise, distaste or fear. <I><FONT color=brown>Shrink</FONT></I> does not carry the implication of suddenness but emphasizes an indecisive cringing from something ominous, frightening or even disgusting. [She <I><FONT color=brown>shrank</FONT></I> from entering the grimy bar with him but once inside, she <I><FONT color=brown>recoiled</FONT></I> at every depraved face that met her gaze.] <I><FONT color=brown>Shrink</FONT></I> may also suggest excessive timidity: a <I><FONT color=brown>shrinking</FONT></I> violet.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Balk</FONT></B> suggests a holding back that is more determined than <I><FONT color=brown>shrink</FONT></I>, but not necessarily sudden, as with <I><FONT color=brown>recoil</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I>. The determination implied by <I><FONT color=brown>balk</FONT></I>, in fact, extends to downright stubbornness: workers who simply <I><FONT color=brown>balked</FONT></I> at the poor conditions in the factory. The word also has a special overtone implying that the subject has put up with a situation as long as possible, but now makes a defiant stand as a result of weariness or anger. [They <I><FONT color=brown>balked</FONT></I> at going another step until their guide agreed to name a fee for his services; The donkey <I><FONT color=brown>balked</FONT></I> at climbing the next hill until he had food and water.] <B><FONT color=blue>Boggle</FONT></B>, by contrast, implies a refusal at the outset, triggered by disbelief, shock or amazement. In one sense, it is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>recoil</FONT></I>: Cabinet members who <I><FONT color=brown>boggled</FONT></I> at the Prime Minister’s astonishing proposal; the mind <I><FONT color=brown>boggle</FONT></I> at such an idea.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shirk</FONT></B> has a special sense that separates it sharply from these other words. The holding back, here, is simply an expression of laziness or unwillingness to co-operate: teachers who <I><FONT color=brown>shirk</FONT></I> the responsibilities they have to their students.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Disagree">DISAGREE</A>, <A href="entry://Hesitate">HESITATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: accede, accept, <A href="entry://Consent">CONSENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words designate bodies of believers who are united in a common faith and form of worship. By derivation, the word <B><FONT color=blue>denomination</FONT></B> is precisely directed to this concept. It comes from the Latin word for name and applies to a religious group adhering to a particular creed under a distinctive name. In its broadest sense, <I><FONT color=brown>denomination</FONT></I> may refer to any such group: State aid to <I><FONT color=brown>denomination</FONT></I> is a subject of fierce controversy. The adjectival form, <I><FONT color=brown>denominational</FONT></I>, is often used in this sense as a synonyms for parochial: <I><FONT color=brown>denominational</FONT></I> schools. But in a restricted sense, the noun <I><FONT color=brown>denomination</FONT></I> is commonly reserved for specific Protestant communions: Representatives of several Protestant <I><FONT color=brown>denominations</FONT></I> were present ?Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians. <B><FONT color=blue>Church</FONT></B> is interchangeable with denomination in this sense. The Methodist denomination, for example, is more often referred to as the Methodist <I><FONT color=brown>Church</FONT></I>. But <I><FONT color=brown>church</FONT></I> has a much wider range of application than <I><FONT color=brown>denomination</FONT></I>. In its broadest sense it may refer to ecclesiastical organization and authority as distinguished from secular authority: the separation of <I><FONT color=brown>church</FONT></I> and state. In the context of Christianity it may designate all, or a major part, of Christendom. [All Christians are members of the universal <I><FONT color=brown>Church</FONT></I>; The Pope is the head of the Roman Catholic <I><FONT color=brown>Church</FONT></I>; The Archbishop of Canterbury is the highest prelate of the <I><FONT color=brown>Church</FONT></I> of England.] In its most strictly limited sense it may refer to an individual congregation or to the building in which that congregation worships. [Which <I><FONT color=brown>church</FONT></I> do you belong to?; My <I><FONT color=brown>church</FONT></I> (or the Presbyterian <I><FONT color=brown>Church</FONT></I>) is just round the corner.] Also, where <I><FONT color=brown>church</FONT></I> stresses the union of believers in one body, <I><FONT color=brown>denomination</FONT></I> emphasizes separateness. Hence, in an ecumenical age of interdenominational activity, the word <I><FONT color=brown>denomination</FONT></I> is less often used in its religious context than formerly.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Religion</FONT></B> is a general word embracing all systems of religious belief. It can be used to refer to the major faiths or to their larger subdivisions: the Christian <I><FONT color=brown>religion</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>religion</FONT></I> of the Mormons; the Jewish <I><FONT color=brown>religion</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>religion</FONT></I> of the Essenes; Islam is the <I><FONT color=brown>religion</FONT></I> of the Moslems. Like denomination, <I><FONT color=brown>religion</FONT></I> may sometimes emphasize differences in belief and in this sense it is often used with reference to Catholicism, Protestantism and Judaism: to marry outside one’s <I><FONT color=brown>religion</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sect</FONT></B> may designate a smaller group within a denomination, especially one that differs from the larger body in a particular matter of faith or worship. <I><FONT color=brown>Sect</FONT></I> is also used derogatorily of a relatively small, unorthodox <I><FONT color=brown>denomination</FONT></I> to stress its separateness or peculiarity: odd <I><FONT color=brown>sects</FONT></I> that spring up and bank on emotional appeal. The word <I><FONT color=brown>sect</FONT></I> acquired this derogatory connotation as a result of the many historical instances when <I><FONT color=brown>sects</FONT></I> were formed by groups that had split from their parent <I><FONT color=brown>religion</FONT></I> because of doctrinal discontent: the <I><FONT color=brown>sects</FONT></I> of the Gnostics.</P><P>The term <B><FONT color=blue>cult</FONT></B> is often applied to the forms or followers of a religious system that is looked on with suspicion or disfavour: The <I><FONT color=brown>cult</FONT></I> of Dionysus inspired orgiastic revelry during the celebrations of the Eleusinian mysteries. It also denotes a kind of worship or veneration that is not theistic in principle and is sometimes faddish in practice: the <I><FONT color=brown>cult</FONT></I> of nature; teenage worship that found momentary expression in the <I><FONT color=brown>cult</FONT></I> of the Beatles.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Faction">FACTION</A>, <A href="entry://Religion">RELIGION</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer either to sincere or censorious disapproval or to an aggrieved or regretful feeling of loss. <B><FONT color=blue>Deplore</FONT></B> often suggests a feeling of righteous indignation. It refers to disapproval that is thoroughgoing and is called up by some affront to decency, taste, propriety or morality: to <I><FONT color=brown>deplore</FONT></I> a stateman’s vacillating policies; <I><FONT color=brown>deploring</FONT></I> the book’s bad writing; <I><FONT color=brown>deploring</FONT></I> the man’s boorish manners.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bemoan</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bewail</FONT></B> are often used in tandem to suggest a <I><FONT color=brown>deploring</FONT></I> attitude that is over-solemn, hypocritical or censorious: <I><FONT color=brown>bemoaning</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>bewailing</FONT></I> their capture as though they were innocent victims. Both words once were used with serious intent but now they are mostly restricted to pejorative or satirical uses. While both words indicate a verbal display of sorrow or grief, <I><FONT color=brown>bemoan</FONT></I> might suggest a greater incoherence, one more nearly reduced to wordless sounds; <I><FONT color=brown>bewail</FONT></I>, by contrast, might suggest a self-indulgent rush of sanctimonious or hypocritical rhetoric. Often no distinction can be seen between the two in actual usage: <I><FONT color=brown>bemoaning</FONT></I> the effort he had to make to support his family; loudly <I><FONT color=brown>bewailing</FONT></I> her husband’s treatment of her to the neighbours.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lament</FONT></B> can also be used pejoratively or satirically, like <I><FONT color=brown>bemoan</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>bewail</FONT></I>; it more specifically suggests, in this case, a hypocritical or self-pitying expression of bereavement or loss: <I><FONT color=brown>lamenting</FONT></I> the passing of the good old days. The word still has legitimate serious uses, however, to indicate sincere grief or remorse: <I><FONT color=brown>lamenting</FONT></I> the fact that it was her own lack of concern that had driven the boy from the house that night. <B><FONT color=blue>Mourn</FONT></B> has pejorative possibilities, but it is much more commonly used to refer to serious expression s of deep loss: a whole nation unashamedly <I><FONT color=brown>mourning</FONT></I> the loss of their leader.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Complain">COMPLAIN</A>, <A href="entry://Grieve">GRIEVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: applaud, approve, cheer, commend, <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>depraved</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>corrupt</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>degenerate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>evil</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>heinous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>infamous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>nefarious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>vicious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>vile</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>villainous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>wicked</FONT></B>:

<P>These adjectives describe persons, qualities or actions that are morally base, malicious or malevolent. <B><FONT color=blue>Depraved</FONT></B> is perhaps the most sinister word. It points to utter perversion, meaning, by derivation, completely bad or totally immoral. In its most common use, it suggests a compulsive or wilful turning away from the good, indicating a warped character or a twisted mind: a <I><FONT color=brown>depraved</FONT></I> sadist; <I><FONT color=brown>depraved</FONT></I> taste. Where <I><FONT color=brown>depraved</FONT></I> tends to be absolute, <B><FONT color=blue>degenerate</FONT></B> is relative, implying a descent from a higher state or better condition. It may indicate moral, physical or mental deterioration from a standard or norm: the <I><FONT color=brown>degenerate</FONT></I> heir to a fortune; the decline of a <I><FONT color=brown>degenerate</FONT></I> empire; a <I><FONT color=brown>degenerate</FONT></I> drug addict. Since <I><FONT color=brown>degenerate</FONT></I> focuses on the results of degradation, however, it is commonly applied to persons or things that may never have been normal to start with: a sexual <I><FONT color=brown>degenerate</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>degenerate</FONT></I> habits. <B><FONT color=blue>Corrupt</FONT></B> is clearer than <I><FONT color=brown>degenerate</FONT></I> in its implication of a lapse from a better condition, even when the resulting adulteration has totally vitiated any positive values that may originally have been present. But where <I><FONT color=brown>degenerate</FONT></I> is applied to very low specimens of humanity, <I><FONT color=brown>corrupt</FONT></I> is often used of persons in high positions whose moral decay may not be apparent on the surface: a <I><FONT color=brown>corrupt</FONT></I> government shot through with graft, vice and venality; a <I><FONT color=brown>corrupt</FONT></I> official who was always receptive to a bribe.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Wicked</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>evil</FONT></B> are both general words with wide application. <I><FONT color=brown>Evil</FONT></I> means morally bad: <I><FONT color=brown>evil</FONT></I> practices; <I><FONT color=brown>evil</FONT></I> companions. In an abstract sense, it is the polar opposite of good and can suggest utter and insidious malevolence: the eternal struggle between good and <I><FONT color=brown>evil</FONT></I> forces in the moral universe. Hence <I><FONT color=brown>evil</FONT></I> can be a much stronger word than <I><FONT color=brown>wicked</FONT></I>, which implies sinfulness and may sound downright old-fashioned: a <I><FONT color=brown>wicked</FONT></I> and unrepentant old reprobate. <I><FONT color=brown>Wicked</FONT></I> is now often used in a humorous, tongue-in-cheek or even admiring way: a tennis player with a <I><FONT color=brown>wicked</FONT></I> serve.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Vile</FONT></B> suggests something noxious or loathsome in its depravity, something utterly despicable or repulsive. A <I><FONT color=brown>corrupt</FONT></I> official might present a pleasant or attractive appearance, but <I><FONT color=brown>vile</FONT></I> indicates disgusting qualities that are readily apparent: a <I><FONT color=brown>vile</FONT></I> mass of putrescence. <I><FONT color=brown>Vile</FONT></I> may, however, be used in a looser sense as a colourful intensive of awful or terrible. [What <I><FONT color=brown>vile</FONT></I> weather!; She’s in a <I><FONT color=brown>vile</FONT></I> mood; Don’t use such <I><FONT color=brown>vile</FONT></I> language.] <B><FONT color=blue>Villainous</FONT></B> suggests egregious wickedness and can be applied disapprovingly to anyone thought guilty of <I><FONT color=brown>evil</FONT></I> behaviour: a <I><FONT color=brown>villainous</FONT></I> traitor. Even more than <I><FONT color=brown>wicked</FONT></I>, however, <I><FONT color=brown>villainous</FONT></I> now imparts an old-fashioned, melodramatic flavour to a denunciation: The <I><FONT color=brown>villainous</FONT></I> scoundrel absconded with her life’s savings; a <I><FONT color=brown>villainous</FONT></I> deed.</P><P>Unlike the other words in this set, <B><FONT color=blue>infamous</FONT></B> refers to notoriety and ill fame, indicating a vile reputation. It points to evil that has gained wide publicity or that deserves universal condemnation and it may apply to a person, action or place: the <I><FONT color=brown>infamous</FONT></I> commandant of Auschwitz; the <I><FONT color=brown>infamous</FONT></I> Nazi concentration camp; his <I><FONT color=brown>infamous</FONT></I> act of treason. <B><FONT color=blue>Nefarious</FONT></B> is the most formal word in the group and the word least often encountered. It may suggest a glaring disregard for law or accepted morality, or a shocking disrespect for things that are worthy of reverence. It often has implications of premeditated group activity that is clandestine and underhand: a <I><FONT color=brown>nefarious</FONT></I> dope ring; a <I><FONT color=brown>nefarious</FONT></I> scheme. <B><FONT color=blue>Vicious</FONT></B> calls to mind a mean, snarling animal baring its fangs and preparing to attack. It is used to describe persons, things or ways of acting that are cruel or brutal, whether or not an <I><FONT color=brown>evil</FONT></I> act is intended: a <I><FONT color=brown>vicious</FONT></I> dog; a <I><FONT color=brown>vicious</FONT></I> gunman. <I><FONT color=brown>Vicious</FONT></I> may also mean spiteful or malicious, as in a <I><FONT color=brown>vicious</FONT></I> lie; <I><FONT color=brown>evil</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>depraved</FONT></I>, as in <I><FONT color=brown>vicious</FONT></I> associates; or morally injurious, as in <I><FONT color=brown>vicious</FONT></I> habits. <B><FONT color=blue>Heinous</FONT></B> comes from an Old French word meaning to hate. It is applied to something so atrocious as to inspire hatred, horror or outrage: Jack the Ripper’s <I><FONT color=brown>heinous</FONT></I> crimes. The word <I><FONT color=brown>heinous</FONT></I>, however, is distinctly high-flown or old fashioned in flavour.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, <A href="entry://Pollute">POLLUTE</A>, profligate.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chaste">CHASTE</A>, <A href="entry://Sincere">HONEST</A>, <A href="entry://Innocent">INNOCENT</A>, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>, pious.</P>

<P>These words refer to downward movement. <B><FONT color=blue>Descend</FONT></B> suggests slow or gradual movement, often down an incline: mountain climbers <I><FONT color=brown>descending</FONT></I> from their overnight camp near the peak’s summit; an aeroplane <I><FONT color=brown>descending</FONT></I> for a landing. <B><FONT color=blue>Drop</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>fall</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggest a sudden and sharp downward movement. <I><FONT color=brown>Fall</FONT></I> may refer to any such movement regardless of how it is caused; <I><FONT color=brown>drop</FONT></I> most strictly suggests something released or set free at a height: a misstep that sent him <I><FONT color=brown>falling</FONT></I> down the stairs; <I><FONT color=brown>dropping</FONT></I> food by parachute to the stranded survivors. This distinction is not always adhered to, however, in the case of <I><FONT color=brown>drop</FONT></I>: Prices <I><FONT color=brown>dropped</FONT></I> drastically during the last hour of heavy trading.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sink</FONT></B> refers to direct downward movement through water or air rather than along an incline. The word often suggests a relatively slow or gradual <I><FONT color=brown>fall</FONT></I>, although this is not always the case: watching the boat fill with water and finally <I><FONT color=brown>sink</FONT></I>; the sun <I><FONT color=brown>sinks</FONT></I> in the West; cold air <I><FONT color=brown>sinking</FONT></I> into the low-lying valley; iron bars that <I><FONT color=brown>sank</FONT></I> quickly without a bubble. <I><FONT color=brown>Sink</FONT></I> may also suggest the fading away of energy or consciousness or a gradual decrease in volume: She <I><FONT color=brown>sank</FONT></I> into a coma; the tide <I><FONT color=brown>sinking</FONT></I> back along the beach. <B><FONT color=blue>Decline</FONT></B> is exclusively concerned with this last sense of sink, specifically pointing to a dying down or running out of something: wondering how long it would be before the fever began to <I><FONT color=brown>decline</FONT></I>; a recession in which prices slowly <I><FONT color=brown>declined</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Decline</FONT></I> would most appropriately suggest a gradual lessening, failing or waning. If a sharp or sudden downward source were indicated, <I><FONT color=brown>drop</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fall</FONT></I> would render this meaning less ambiguously.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Decrease">DECREASE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Climb">CLIMB</A>, increase, lift, soar.</P>

descent
<B><FONT color=blue>descent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ancestry</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lineage</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pedigree</FONT></B>:

<P>These words may designate, collectively, those from whom one is descended or may indicate characteristics inherited from them. <B><FONT color=blue>Descent</FONT></B> is the most general word. It is frequently used to refer to the nationality, race or ethnic characteristics of one’s immediate forebears: a woman of Swedish <I><FONT color=brown>descent</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Ancestry</FONT></B> refers most strictly to all one’s progenitors on both sides: He could trace his <I><FONT color=brown>ancestry</FONT></I> all the way back to William the Conqueror. It may also like <I><FONT color=brown>descent</FONT></I>, mean ancestral derivation of whatever kind: a youth of royal <I><FONT color=brown>ancestry</FONT></I>; a mongrel of dubious <I><FONT color=brown>ancestry</FONT></I>. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>descent</FONT></I>, however, <I><FONT color=brown>ancestry</FONT></I> sometimes points specifically to noble or distinguished forebears: He thought he was better than other people because of his <I><FONT color=brown>ancestry</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Lineage</FONT></B> emphasizes a direct line of <I><FONT color=brown>descent</FONT></I> from a particular <I><FONT color=brown>ancestor</FONT></I>. It may embrace in one family, for purposes of genealogy, all the descendants of such a progenitor: St. Joseph was of the house and <I><FONT color=brown>lineage</FONT></I> of David. <I><FONT color=brown>Lineage</FONT></I>, however, excludes all other branching of the family tree. Many people are of the <I><FONT color=brown>lineage</FONT></I> of William the Conqueror, but the rest of their <I><FONT color=brown>ancestry</FONT></I> varies so greatly that their being of William’s <I><FONT color=brown>lineage</FONT></I> has relatively little significance in accounting for their individual characteristics.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pedigree</FONT></B> stresses notable ancestry that is documented in detail and that usually includes many outstanding forebears. It may also refer to a list or table of <I><FONT color=brown>descent</FONT></I>, often a genealogical register of an animal. [A <I><FONT color=brown>pedigreed</FONT></I> pet is one of pure breed; Many dog owners are prouder of their pets <I><FONT color=brown>pedigree</FONT></I> than they are of their own.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Ancestor">ANCESTOR</A>, <A href="entry://Kin">KIN</A>.</P>

desecration
<B><FONT color=blue>desecration</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>debasement</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>defilement</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>profanation</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sacrilege</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>violation</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all refer to irreverent or improper acts. <B><FONT color=blue>Desecration</FONT></B> is the opposite of consecration. It indicates the dishonoring of something sacred by wrongful use or irreverent treatment and it commonly implies a conscious or intentional act. Specifically, the word often points to the deliberate degrading, damaging or destroying of a religious building or place: The stabling of horses in a church would be a <I><FONT color=brown>desecration</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>desecration</FONT></I> of Jewish synagogues and cemeteries by the Nazis. Outside a religious context, <I><FONT color=brown>desecration</FONT></I> may suggest the contemptuous abuse of anything that is held dear or regarded as sacred: a <I><FONT color=brown>desecration</FONT></I> of our country’s flag. <B><FONT color=blue>Profanation</FONT></B> is a milder word than <I><FONT color=brown>desecration</FONT></I> and is less commonly used. It may or may not involve physical abuse of a sacred place but focuses on a lack of proper respect or a callous or shocking act of irreverence: the <I><FONT color=brown>profanation</FONT></I> of a shrine by thoughtless sightseers; a cult that considered it a <I><FONT color=brown>profanation</FONT></I> to visit its temple without a full day of fasting. Literally, <I><FONT color=brown>profanation</FONT></I> suggests a reduction of something sacred to the level of the secular; but the word has few general uses outside the religious context. <B><FONT color=blue>Sacrilege</FONT></B> comes from a Latin word meaning temple robber. In a theological sense, it may imply the improper use of a sacrament, as by one unfit to give or receive it. In a broader sense, it often points to an irreligious or taboo act that <I><FONT color=brown>profanes</FONT></I> the sacred character person, place or thing in a shocking way: The primitive tribe considered it a <I><FONT color=brown>sacrilege</FONT></I> to utter the sacred name. <I><FONT color=brown>Sacrilege</FONT></I> is even less concrete than <I><FONT color=brown>profanation</FONT></I>, though, since the irreverence involved can consist of a thought as well as an act and need not occur within religious surroundings: It was deemed a <I><FONT color=brown>sacrilege</FONT></I> to question the witch doctor’s teachings even for a moment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Defilement</FONT></B> suggests the dirtying or profanation of something that should be cherished or kept pure. In a religious sense it may indicate the act of rendering something ceremonially (though not literally) unclean the <I><FONT color=brown>defilement</FONT></I> of the temple by the presence in it of infidels. In a broader sense, it may indicate either a physical or spiritual sullying: the <I><FONT color=brown>defilement</FONT></I> of justice by prejudiced and corrupt officials. <B><FONT color=blue>Debasement</FONT></B> is less often used in a religious sense and does not suggest befouling or pollution. Instead, it focuses on a lowering in character, quality or worth: determined to tolerate no <I><FONT color=brown>debasement</FONT></I>, however slight, of the club’s standards. Applied to persons, <I><FONT color=brown>debasement</FONT></I> may indicate a public humiliation, as though verbal attack: the accusations he shouted at her during the formal dinner made his <I><FONT color=brown>debasement</FONT></I> of her complete.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>desecration</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>profanation</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>violation</FONT></B> may apply to the irreverent treatment of a sacred thing or holy place: the <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of the shrine by souvenir hunters; the vandals?<I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of the sanctuary. But this word more often carries legal connotations than religious ones, suggesting the breaking of a law or a failure to abide by the terms of a binding contract: a <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of the tenancy clause. Outside this specific context it can be used of a sexual attack: medical tests to determine if there had been a sexual <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of the woman. In its most general sense, it can refer to any outrage of decency: a <I><FONT color=brown>violation</FONT></I> of his sense of fair play.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Crime">CRIME</A>, <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, <A href="entry://Disgrace">DISGRACE</A>, <A href="entry://Pollute">POLLUTE</A>, <A href="entry://Worldly">WORLDLY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: consecration, purification, sanctification.</P>

<P>These words refer to a defeated, pessimistic attitude. <B><FONT color=blue>Despair</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of these. It implies the loss or abandonment of hope and may suggest a permanent state of mind or a momentary one bought about by some calamity: lives doomed to want and uncreative <I><FONT color=brown>despair</FONT></I>; their silent <I><FONT color=brown>despair</FONT></I> at having lost the election. It may also refer specifically to pessimism about the future, whether momentary or permanent: a growing <I><FONT color=brown>despair</FONT></I> of ever getting a salary rise. <B><FONT color=blue>Hopelessness</FONT></B> relates exclusively to this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>despair</FONT></I>, implying a pessimism more deep-seated and long lasting: the utter <I><FONT color=brown>hopelessness</FONT></I> with which she regarded her narrow range of choices. The word may also suggest that someone’s present position is extremely imperilled with or without his realizing it: they were not yet aware of the <I><FONT color=brown>hopelessness</FONT></I> of their situation, given the lack of fresh water on the lifeboat.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Discouragement</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dejection</FONT></B> are much milder words than the others of this group. They restrict themselves to one possibility of despair in that they pertain almost exclusively to a let-down feeling at some misfortune or rebuff: the understandable <I><FONT color=brown>discouragement</FONT></I> with which he took the dismissal of his application; in constant <I><FONT color=brown>dejection</FONT></I> ever since his girl went away. <I><FONT color=brown>Dejection</FONT></I> is a state of existence, while <I><FONT color=brown>discouragement</FONT></I> most often suggests a response to the thwarting of frustration of an on-going process of effort; it can be momentary (as above), gradual or total: growing <I><FONT color=brown>discouragement</FONT></I> with his life that he couldn’t even explain or analyse. <B><FONT color=blue>Despondency</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>depression</FONT></B> also pertain to a thwarted or frustrated feeling, but are more intense than <I><FONT color=brown>discouragement</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>dejection</FONT></I> in suggesting more strictly a sense of total defeat that is expressed in lethargy, introversion and apathy: days of <I><FONT color=brown>despondency</FONT></I> in which he hardly bothered to get out of bed; a long period of <I><FONT color=brown>depression</FONT></I> before the first suicide attempt. These words relate tangentially to <I><FONT color=brown>hopelessness</FONT></I> in that such thoroughgoing defeat as the words suggest usually implies, as well, a feeling that the future will not improve one’s situation. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>depression</FONT></I> is the more intense, probably because it is the medical and psychological term for such a state.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Desperation</FONT></B> is unique among these words in suggesting such an intensity of <I><FONT color=brown>despair</FONT></I> that one may easily be goaded into wild, blind or reckless action as a last resort. Thus the word contrasts drastically with <I><FONT color=brown>despondency</FONT></I> and its implications of lethargy: fighting back at his tormentors with the <I><FONT color=brown>desperation</FONT></I> of a cornered rat; willing to risk anything in his seizure of <I><FONT color=brown>desperation</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Miserable">MISERABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Misery">MISERY</A>, <A href="entry://Sad">SAD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Confidence">CONFIDENCE</A>, encouragement, <A href="entry://Expectation">EXPECTATION</A>, hope, hopefulness, optimism.</P>

destiny
<B><FONT color=blue>destiny</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fortune</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lot</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a situation or outcome as though it were fixed or predetermined. <B><FONT color=blue>Destiny</FONT></B> is the most general and lease specific of these. It can suggest an occult prearrangement of the future: No man can escape his <I><FONT color=brown>destiny</FONT></I>. At the other extreme, it can refer simply to a result without suggesting any forces at work beyond cause and effect: Parliament meeting to decide the <I><FONT color=brown>destiny</FONT></I> of the abortion reform law. <B><FONT color=blue>Fate</FONT></B>, by contrast, is much stronger in implications of a deterministic pattern. Where <I><FONT color=brown>destiny</FONT></I> might point to a desired goal without rejecting the notion of free will, <I><FONT color=brown>fate</FONT></I> points to an outcome, good or bad, as though choice, chance or cause and effect played no part in its working out: Oriental religions that advise man to accept his <I><FONT color=brown>fate</FONT></I> without bitterness.

By contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>fate</FONT></I>, it often indicates good luck or a pleasant outcome, especially when personified: hoping that <I><FONT color=brown>fortune</FONT></I> would smile on their efforts. A related use refers to a favourable future goal towards which one can work or struggle: going off to seek wealth and <I><FONT color=brown>fortune</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Lot</FONT></B> once suggested a <I><FONT color=brown>fate</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fortune</FONT></I> that befell one by chance; now, however, it refers mainly to one’s station in life, however, arrived at: peasants whose <I><FONT color=brown>lot</FONT></I> in life was hard and bitter; each person must learn how to bear his <I><FONT color=brown>lot</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chance">CHANCE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: choice, freedom, free will, will.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>destroy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>annihilate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>demolish</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>eradicate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>exterminate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>extinguish</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>extirpate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>raze</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ruin</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>uproot</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>wreck</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the complete and usually forcible breaking up or damaging of something so that it is no longer recognizable or effective. <B><FONT color=blue>Destroy</FONT></B> is a general word with few overtones beyond its emphasis on force and thoroughness: the cyclone that <I><FONT color=brown>destroyed</FONT></I> dozens of houses in the town. <B><FONT color=blue>Ruin</FONT></B> is even more general, pointing only to the thoroughness of the damage; force, however, may not be involved and a single destructive act may not be at issue: manuscripts <I><FONT color=brown>ruined</FONT></I> by long exposure in the cold, damp cellar. <B><FONT color=blue>Wreck</FONT></B> suggests a battering action that breaks something up into an unusable mass or heap of fragments: companies that specialize in <I><FONT color=brown>wrecking</FONT></I> buildings. These three words, particularly, have a wide range of use beyond actual physical destruction. Here, <I><FONT color=brown>destroy</FONT></I> may suggest malevolent action that makes something impossible: escalation that <I><FONT color=brown>destroyed</FONT></I> all hopes for a negotiated peace. <I><FONT color=brown>Ruin</FONT></I> points to anything that spoils or mars something good or desirable: a thunderstorm that <I><FONT color=brown>ruined</FONT></I> our picnic. <I><FONT color=brown>Wreck</FONT></I> suggests the breaking down of some cohesive unity: the constant squabbling that finally <I><FONT color=brown>wrecked</FONT></I> their marriage.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Demolish</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>raze</FONT></B> are generally applied to big or substantial things, such as buildings or other edifices. A building is <I><FONT color=brown>demolished</FONT></I> if smashed to pieces and <I><FONT color=brown>razed</FONT></I> if levelled to the ground. <I><FONT color=brown>Demolish</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>raze</FONT></I>, is often used figuratively of the reduction of any complex whole to <I><FONT color=brown>ruins</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>demolish</FONT></I> a theory with a few incisive comments. <I><FONT color=brown>Raze</FONT></I> is used almost invariably of buildings or their remains: to <I><FONT color=brown>raze</FONT></I> the upright timbers left in the aftermath of the fire.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Annihilate</FONT></B> is the most extreme word in this list, and literally means to reduce to nothingness. As more commonly used, however, it denotes a severe degree of damage to a thing or person. An army may <I><FONT color=brown>annihilate</FONT></I> an enemy force by so damaging it as to render it incapable of further offensive or defensive action, but without literally removing all traces of its existence. A debater may be said to <I><FONT color=brown>annihilate</FONT></I> his opponent if he defeats him decisively.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Eradicate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>uproot</FONT></B> are etymological equivalents, but differ in their applications. To <I><FONT color=brown>eradicate</FONT></I> weeds is not only to <I><FONT color=brown>destroy</FONT></I> their visible parts but to pull them out by the roots and thus prevent their reappearance. <I><FONT color=brown>Eradicate</FONT></I> can mean simply to eliminate completely: the new vaccine <I><FONT color=brown>eradicated</FONT></I> all traces of the disease within three months: <I><FONT color=brown>Uproot</FONT></I> means to pull up by the roots, and is used figuratively as well as literally: trees <I><FONT color=brown>uprooted</FONT></I> by the hurricane; a family <I><FONT color=brown>uprooted</FONT></I> by the decision to build a highway through its property.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Exterminate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>extinguish</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>extirpate</FONT></B> often mean to <I><FONT color=brown>destroy</FONT></I> purposefully. <I><FONT color=brown>Exterminate</FONT></I> means to wipe out or kill in great numbers: to <I><FONT color=brown>exterminate</FONT></I> insects by spraying with DDT. <I><FONT color=brown>Extinguish</FONT></I> means to put out, as a fire; the word is also used metaphorically as a synonym for die, thus implying a comparison between life and a spark or flame: His life was finally <I><FONT color=brown>extinguished</FONT></I> by the onset of pneumonia. <I><FONT color=brown>Extirpate</FONT></I> refers to the rooting out or utter destruction of something: to <I><FONT color=brown>extirpate</FONT></I> a disease by <I><FONT color=brown>destroying</FONT></I> the organisms that cause it; to <I><FONT color=brown>extirpate</FONT></I> heresy within the church.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Break">BREAK</A>, <A href="entry://Harm">HARM</A>, <A href="entry://Remove">REMOVE</A>, <A href="entry://Vanquish">VANQUISH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Build">BUILD</A>, <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Devise">DEVISE</A>, establish, <A href="entry://Repair">REPAIR</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to any actions that prevent something from pursuing its natural or intended course forward. <B><FONT color=blue>Delay</FONT></B> may suggest either a slowing down of movement or a temporary but full stop in a forward motion. <B><FONT color=blue>Detain</FONT></B>, in contrast, suggests a longer, possibly permanent halt. <B><FONT color=blue>Retard</FONT></B>, in distinction from both, suggests a considerable slowing down of movement but not necessarily a halt at all; it is also more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>delay</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>detain</FONT></I>. [I was <I><FONT color=brown>delayed</FONT></I> several times on my walk by people seeking my name on various petitions; I was <I><FONT color=brown>detained</FONT></I> from keeping our appointment by a business conference that lasted most of the day; Economic progress in Latin America has been consistently <I><FONT color=brown>retarded</FONT></I> by a high birth rate.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hold</FONT></B> is more informal than the previous words but also implies direct intervention and possible physical contact: It is often followed by <I><FONT color=brown>back</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>up</FONT></I>: a man who would have joined the fight but for two friends who <I><FONT color=brown>held</FONT></I> him <I><FONT color=brown>back</FONT></I>; a flight that was <I><FONT color=brown>held up</FONT></I> for several hours because of poor visibility. As can be seen <I><FONT color=brown>hold</FONT></I> suggests the temporary full stop possible for <I><FONT color=brown>delay</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Keep</FONT></B> also hares this suggestion; it often appears with <I><FONT color=brown>out</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>back</FONT></I> and suggests the imposition of a barrier, not necessarily physical, that must be removed before progress can be resumed. [He was <I><FONT color=brown>kept</FONT></I> from entering the burning house by several neighbours; She was <I><FONT color=brown>kept</FONT></I> from speaking out by her distaste for unpleasant scenes; They were <I><FONT color=brown>kept out</FONT></I> of the square by the large demonstration that was under way; Traffic was <I><FONT color=brown>kept back</FONT></I> by hastily erected barricades.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, <A href="entry://Subdue">SUBDUE</A>, <A href="entry://Thwart">THWART</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Further">FURTHER</A>, <A href="entry://Quicken">QUICKEN</A>, <A href="entry://Send">SEND</A>, <A href="entry://Speed">SPEED</A>.</P>

<P>These words are concerned with the development of plans for solving a particular problem. <B><FONT color=blue>Devise</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>contrive</FONT></B> both stress the actual working out of the plan, detail by detail. <I><FONT color=brown>Devise</FONT></I> is neutral in tone, making no comment on the value of the plan or its objective; it also emphasizes the tentative nature of the proceedings, suggesting that many possibilities are entertained, used, rejected or revised: <I><FONT color=brown>devising</FONT></I> proposals to deal with air pollution; <I><FONT color=brown>devising</FONT></I> a strategy that could win the battle. <I><FONT color=brown>Contrive</FONT></I> is similar in most respects to devise except for its tone which may now suggest a conspiratorial or illicit plotting towards unworthy ends: <I><FONT color=brown>contriving</FONT></I> a fool-proof scheme for robbing the bank. In a different but also negative sense <I><FONT color=brown>contrive</FONT></I> may suggest unrealistic planning, needless complication or artificial devices that avoid the problem rather than solve it: a law so <I><FONT color=brown>contrived</FONT></I> that the average person could not possibly understand or obey it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conceive</FONT></B> refers to a point in the planning process that must precede <I><FONT color=brown>devising</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>contriving</FONT></I>. The word suggests the first ideas that form themselves in a person’s mind when faced with a problem, but before these ideas have necessarily been tested by the process implied in <I><FONT color=brown>devise</FONT></I>. He <I><FONT color=brown>devise</FONT></I> an escape from it. <B><FONT color=blue>Formulate</FONT></B>, by contrast, refers to an act that follows <I><FONT color=brown>devising</FONT></I>, in which the rough plan is spelt out, formalized, or put into words. Each step of the whole planning process may be evaluated separately. [The proposed law, while brilliantly <I><FONT color=brown>conceived</FONT></I>, has been poorly <I><FONT color=brown>devised</FONT></I> to do the job at hand; even worse, it is so vaguely <I><FONT color=brown>formulated</FONT></I> that it invites misinterpretation.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Invent</FONT></B> is a word much larger in scope than the others here. It includes the whole planning process ?<I><FONT color=brown>conceiving</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>devising</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>formulating</FONT></I>. Also, its product is more often an actual object than simply a set of procedural techniques: <I><FONT color=brown>inventing</FONT></I> new synthetic fibres; <I><FONT color=brown>inventing</FONT></I> new techniques for coping with juvenile delinquency.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Intend">INTEND</A>, <A href="entry://Suppose">SUPPOSE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Die</FONT></B> is the simplest word in this group, the most straightforward and direct way of saying to stop living, to experience the permanent cessation of all vital functions. It is used figuratively in reference to anything that ceases to exist. [The smile <I><FONT color=brown>died</FONT></I> on his lips; The flames in the fireplace <I><FONT color=brown>died</FONT></I> slowly, keeping the room warm for an hour or more.] To <B><FONT color=blue>die with one’s boots on</FONT></B> originally designated the end of a person who <I><FONT color=brown>died</FONT></I> violently, especially in battle and in the kind of battle dress which included boots. Today a person who <I><FONT color=brown>dies with his boots on</FONT></I> is one who <I><FONT color=brown>dies</FONT></I> while engage in some activity, as his work, profession, etc., not during a period of prolonged illness or retirement. <B><FONT color=blue>Expire</FONT></B> means to breathe out air from the lungs. This sense is extended somewhat euphemistically to a breathing out of one’s last breach and so is synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>die</FONT></I>: the old man <I><FONT color=brown>expired</FONT></I> only after he’d made a final confession and been administered extreme unction. It is also used figuratively of things that cease to exist by reaching a natural limit: my lease will <I><FONT color=brown>expire</FONT></I> on September 30<SUP>th</SUP> of this year. To <B><FONT color=blue>perish</FONT></B> is to die untimely or in a violent way: hundreds of sheep <I><FONT color=brown>perished</FONT></I> that year because of drought. <I><FONT color=brown>Perish</FONT></I> is a rather literary word and is often used to denote complete destruction and decay: a civilization that perished of greed and decadence. <B><FONT color=blue>Depart</FONT></B> is a euphemism suggestive of the soul’s leaving this plane of existence at the time of death and going on to another life elsewhere. <B><FONT color=blue>Pass away</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pass on</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pass over</FONT></B> all are like <I><FONT color=brown>depart</FONT></I> in their implication of moving to an afterlife, while <B><FONT color=blue>go to meet one’s Maker</FONT></B> is even more explicit in its designation of the terminal point of the soul’s journey. <B><FONT color=blue>Bite the dust</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>kick the bucket</FONT></B> are both slang expressions for <I><FONT color=brown>die</FONT></I>. The former once pertained especially to death on the battlefield where one literally bit the dust in a fall from a horse when wounded. Today it applies not only to actual death but to the figurative death that is caused by failure or ruin: Another small business <I><FONT color=brown>bit the dust</FONT></I> this week. <I><FONT color=brown>Kick the bucket</FONT></I> is thought by some to be derived from the last act of a person who hangs himself by fixing round his neck a noose which is attached to the ceiling and then kicking away an upturned bucket on which he has been standing.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Corpse">CORPSE</A>, <A href="entry://Dead">DEAD</A>, <A href="entry://Fatal">FATAL</A>, <A href="entry://Kill">KILL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Exist">EXIST</A>, <A href="entry://Persist">PERSIST</A>, survive.</P>

<P>These words are here compared as they apply to persons who do not accomplish tings quickly or to actions which consume a great deal of time, often more than is thought necessary. <B><FONT color=blue>Slow</FONT></B>, the most general word, means extending or occurring over a relatively long span of time. <I><FONT color=brown>Slow</FONT></I> may be positive in its application to persons: a <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I> but meticulous craftsman; a man <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I> to anger. It may also suggest such undesirable traits as laziness or stupidity: <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I> in her work because she talks constantly to fellow workers; a person of such limited ability that he is <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I> to understand the simplest directions. Often the word indicates no more than not fast in progress or prompt in action: proceeding down the street at a <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I> walk.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gradual</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>leisurely</FONT></B> are never applied to persons. <I><FONT color=brown>Gradual</FONT></I> stresses advancement by slow or even imperceptible steps or degrees, but it involves a continuous progress: a <I><FONT color=brown>gradual</FONT></I> change for the better in one’s health; to make <I><FONT color=brown>gradual</FONT></I> improvements in an old house. Anything that is leisurely is performed with no thought of a time limit and may be <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I> or simply unhurried and relaxed: a <I><FONT color=brown>leisurely</FONT></I> drive, a <I><FONT color=brown>leisurely</FONT></I> holiday.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deliberate</FONT></B> in this context adds the connotation of caution and care to <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I>. A person is <I><FONT color=brown>deliberate</FONT></I> if he acts after weighing all the aspects of a situation; thus, what may appear slow may save time in the long run; A methodical man plans his work in a <I><FONT color=brown>deliberate</FONT></I> manner.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dilatory</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>laggard</FONT></B> bring the concept of delay to slow. The <I><FONT color=brown>dilatory</FONT></I> person wastes time by being slow in doing what he could or should do promptly, and procrastinates either because he is not self-disciplined or is unwilling to exert himself: a <I><FONT color=brown>dilatory</FONT></I> correspondent. <I><FONT color=brown>Laggard</FONT></I>, a stronger and more censorious word, implies lingering and falling behind in progress through laziness and a refusal to make an effort: <I><FONT color=brown>laggard</FONT></I> in paying his debt; <I><FONT color=brown>laggard</FONT></I> in finding a job, thus letting his parents support him.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Slack</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sluggish</FONT></B> both stress having little motion or alertness. To be <I><FONT color=brown>slack</FONT></I> is not only to be <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I>, but the word indicates negligence in the performance of one’s duties: police who are <I><FONT color=brown>slack</FONT></I> in enforcing traffic rules; a <I><FONT color=brown>slack</FONT></I> housekeeper. Used of a period of time, it refers to a temporary lessening of activity in some endeavour: a <I><FONT color=brown>slack</FONT></I> season in the fur trade. <I><FONT color=brown>Sluggish</FONT></I> more than slack implies reluctance and sometimes an inability to move forward: a <I><FONT color=brown>sluggish</FONT></I> digestive system; a <I><FONT color=brown>sluggish</FONT></I> river. In a general sense <I><FONT color=brown>sluggish</FONT></I> is often applied to both physical and mental lethargy: to feel sense <I><FONT color=brown>sluggish</FONT></I> is often applied to both physical and mental lethargy: to feel <I><FONT color=brown>sluggish</FONT></I> in hot, humid weather; a mind too <I><FONT color=brown>sluggish</FONT></I> to entertain new ideas.</P><P>At one time <B><FONT color=blue>retarded</FONT></B> meant <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I> or delayed [a <I><FONT color=brown>retarded</FONT></I> watch], but it is now applied mainly to describing children who are slow or backward in mental development and in school achievement.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Listless">LISTLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Sloth">SLOTH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: agile, fast, <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>, quick, rapid, speedy.</P>

<P>These words describe the continual painstaking exertion of intense care and effort. <B><FONT color=blue>Diligent</FONT></B> suggests the accomplishment of work that is well done and that demands the worker’s alertness and dedication to the task: his <I><FONT color=brown>diligent</FONT></I> efforts to vindicate his father’s name. There is also an implication of wary watchfulness and the making of extremely fine distinctions: inspectors <I><FONT color=brown>diligent</FONT></I> enough to catch the slightest lowering of standards.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sedulous</FONT></B> is considerably more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>diligent</FONT></I> but also stresses attentiveness, with a special overtone of unwearying application to an exhausting task: a teacher who proceeded so rapidly that only the most <I><FONT color=brown>sedulous</FONT></I> student could follow him. <B><FONT color=blue>Assiduous</FONT></B> is only slightly less formal than <I><FONT color=brown>sedulous</FONT></I>; it emphasizes the ability to do quantities of sheer hard work. There is less implication that the work is well done as in <I><FONT color=brown>diligent</FONT></I> or that it is extremely taxing as in <I><FONT color=brown>sedulous</FONT></I>. It does suggest dogged determination and an energetic approach: an <I><FONT color=brown>assiduous</FONT></I> struggle against the untamed land that every year brought forth more and more crops. [A poorly edited book requires the reader’s <I><FONT color=brown>sedulous</FONT></I> attention to make up for the lack of <I><FONT color=brown>diligent</FONT></I> copy editing and <I><FONT color=brown>assiduous</FONT></I> proof-reading.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Persevering</FONT></B> has an area of meaning that sets it more clearly apart from the foregoing words; it refers to an unremitting effort that is not weakened by momentary failures: to watch the <I><FONT color=brown>persevering</FONT></I> spider attempt to build her web time and time again. <I><FONT color=brown>Persevering</FONT></I> clearly indicates nothing about the quality or quantity of the work done, only about the unflagging nature of the effort: <I><FONT color=brown>persevering</FONT></I> in the typing assignment despite her exhaustion and her loss of accuracy and speed. <B><FONT color=blue>Industrious</FONT></B> also makes no comment upon the quality of the work accomplished but it does stress constancy or speed of execution. It also suggests a cheerful or good-humoured bustle: <I><FONT color=brown>industrious</FONT></I> clerks who turned out mountains of filing and paper work in just a few hours.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Busy">BUSY</A>, <A href="entry://Careful">CAREFUL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Flippant">FLIPPANT</A>, <A href="entry://Heedless">HEEDLESS</A>, impatient, <A href="entry://Jaunty">JAUNTY</A>, lazy, negligent, procrastinating, <A href="entry://Slow">SLOW</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to an expressed lack of concurrence between the ideas of two people. <B><FONT color=blue>Disagree</FONT></B> may refer to any verbalized discord, whether trivial or fundamental, whether arising out of a dispute over facts or simply out of a contest of wills: <I><FONT color=brown>disagreeing</FONT></I> over which road to take; <I><FONT color=brown>disagreeing</FONT></I> as to when Shakespeare was born; those who <I><FONT color=brown>disagree</FONT></I> merely for the sake of controversy. <B><FONT color=blue>Differ</FONT></B> is milder than <I><FONT color=brown>disagree</FONT></I>; it might sound excessively formal to some ears, except in the common phrase, "I beg to <I><FONT color=brown>differ</FONT></I> from you." As a substitution for <I><FONT color=brown>disagree</FONT></I> it can even sound euphemistic: urging them not to <I><FONT color=brown>differ</FONT></I> over so slight a matter. It has a real use, however, when one wishes to suggest lack of agreement that does not arise from hostility: <I><FONT color=brown>differing</FONT></I> on the causes of poverty but agreeing on steps to eradicate it. The word, also, can suggest mere factual discrepancy from which no conclusions have yet been drawn: the detective who asked us why our versions of the accident <I><FONT color=brown>differed</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Object</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dissent</FONT></B> are more intense than either <I><FONT color=brown>disagree</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>differ</FONT></I> and suggest a more thoroughgoing dispute. <I><FONT color=brown>Object</FONT></I> most appropriately pertain to a single point of disagreement: <I><FONT color=brown>objecting</FONT></I> vehemently to his last inference. <I><FONT color=brown>Dissent</FONT></I>, on the other hand, would suggest the complete rejection of someone else’s case, both formulated in detail. [A radical does not merely <I><FONT color=brown>object</FONT></I> to a few scattered instances of injustice; he <I><FONT color=brown>dissents</FONT></I> from a whole way of life.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cavil</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>quibble</FONT></B> pertain to the raising of petty objections to a line of thought. <I><FONT color=brown>Cavil</FONT></I> is the harsher of the two with its implications of ill-tempered hostility: frowning negotiators who <I><FONT color=brown>cavilled</FONT></I> at every new proposal simply to prolong the deadlock. <I><FONT color=brown>Quibble</FONT></I> may suggest the bad humour of <I><FONT color=brown>cavil</FONT></I> or it may refer only to a super-solemn, over-refined attention to detail that is sophistical in its triviality; scholastics <I><FONT color=brown>quibbling</FONT></I> over the number of angels that could dance on the head of a pin. <I><FONT color=brown>Quibble</FONT></I>, when it suggests contention, still stresses an almost legalistic pettiness: <I><FONT color=brown>quibbling</FONT></I> for hours about which candidate had the stronger platform. <B><FONT color=blue>Bicker</FONT></B> is an intensification of this sense of <I><FONT color=brown>quibble</FONT></I>, suggesting more hostility between the arguers, but with no lessening of the triviality inherent in the argument. Name-calling and groundless assertions, however, may be included as tenchniques of dispute: <I><FONT color=brown>bickering</FONT></I> about who should get up and shut the door.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Contradict">CONTRADICT</A>, <A href="entry://Demur">DEMUR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Consent">CONSENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words describe qualities or situations that arouse feelings of displeasure or dislike, but usually not of strong aversion. <B><FONT color=blue>Bad</FONT></B>, the most general word of this group, may be a weak synonym for any of the other terms, indicating an unfavourable or undesirable quality. Bad government usually means corrupt government; a <I><FONT color=brown>bad</FONT></I> typist is an incompetent typist; a <I><FONT color=brown>bad</FONT></I> odour is often a disgusting or offensive odour; a <I><FONT color=brown>bad</FONT></I> child is a troublesome child; a <I><FONT color=brown>bad</FONT></I> situation may be either an unhappy or a dangerous situation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unpleasant</FONT></B> is also a general word, but with a more limited application than bad. <I><FONT color=brown>Unpleasant</FONT></I> simply means not pleasant, failing to please: an <I><FONT color=brown>unpleasant</FONT></I> evening spent listening to a bore. However, <I><FONT color=brown>unpleasant</FONT></I> is often used as is bad to describe things that are displeasing or painful in various degrees of intensity. An <I><FONT color=brown>unpleasant</FONT></I> operation may be a polite description of a painful operation; an <I><FONT color=brown>unpleasant</FONT></I> day may be a polite description of a painful operation; an <I><FONT color=brown>unpleasant</FONT></I> day may be a tiring day or a stormy day; an <I><FONT color=brown>unpleasant</FONT></I> person may be s selfish, quarrelsome or dirty person; an <I><FONT color=brown>unpleasant</FONT></I> taste my be a bitter or rancid taste.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disagreeable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>distasteful</FONT></B> are stronger and more specific terms than bad and <I><FONT color=brown>unpleasant</FONT></I>. That which is <I><FONT color=brown>disagreeable</FONT></I> offends the senses, the feelings or the opinions: the <I><FONT color=brown>disagreeable</FONT></I> taste of sour milk; to find the attentions of an unwanted suitor <I><FONT color=brown>disagreeable</FONT></I>; to find expressions of bigotry not only <I><FONT color=brown>disagreeable</FONT></I> to listen to, but almost impossible to eradicate. That which is <I><FONT color=brown>distasteful</FONT></I> is something which one finds <I><FONT color=brown>disagreeable</FONT></I> or shuns, not because it is inherently bad or undesirable, but because it goes against one'?tastes or nature. [Some people find hard work <I><FONT color=brown>distasteful</FONT></I>; Asking a favour from anyone was <I><FONT color=brown>distasteful</FONT></I> to my mother.] <I><FONT color=brown>Distasteful</FONT></I> is now only rarely applied to food or drink that is poorly prepared or has a <I><FONT color=brown>disagreeable</FONT></I> taste.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Objectionable</FONT></B> carries strong overtones of disapproval and moral indignation: The censors declared the love scenes in the book to be <I><FONT color=brown>objectionable</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Objectionable</FONT></I> may also apply to that which is counter to one’s sense of what is proper, fitting or aesthetically pleasing. [Sentimentality is <I><FONT color=brown>objectionable</FONT></I> to critical, informed lovers of art; The Japanese, with their love of simplicity and order, find cluttered interiors <I><FONT color=brown>objectionable</FONT></I>.] </P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Flaw">FLAW</A>, <A href="entry://Mischievous">MISCHIEVOUS</A>, profligate, <A href="entry://Repulsive">REPULSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Sin">SIN</A>, <A href="entry://Weak">WEAK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: acceptable, desirable, good, pleasant, <A href="entry://Pleasing">PLEASING</A>, satisfactory, unobjectionable.</P>

disapproval

<P>These words refer to negative judgements or attitudes towards something. <B><FONT color=blue>Disapproval</FONT></B> is the most general of these; it may refer to a fixed, irrational dislike of a person or to a specific instance of reasoned, analytic rejection of an idea or a way of behaving: meeting his efforts at friendliness with ever harsher signs of her icy <I><FONT color=brown>disapproval</FONT></I>; attempting to demonstrate her <I><FONT color=brown>disapproval</FONT></I> of such a solution to their problems. <B><FONT color=blue>Criticism</FONT></B> is more exclusively restricted to this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>disapproval</FONT></I>, usually suggesting an expressed rejection of a specific thing because of its failure to meet certain standards: his constant <I><FONT color=brown>criticism</FONT></I> of her way of dressing; fierce <I><FONT color=brown>criticism</FONT></I> of every weakness in the debater’s argument. The word, as commonly understood, most often suggests <I><FONT color=brown>disapproval</FONT></I>, although in more formal use it can suggest neutral analysis or even approving evaluation: the first work of <I><FONT color=brown>criticism</FONT></I> to claim greatness for a certain contemporary author. <B><FONT color=blue>Blame</FONT></B> does not suggest a measuring of something against standards; it stresses, on the contrary, an attempt to determine who is at fault for some failure or catastrophe that has already occurred. Thus the word most specifically suggests the assigning of guilt or responsibility: fixing <I><FONT color=brown>blame</FONT></I> on the police for their handling of the riot; taking the <I><FONT color=brown>blame</FONT></I> for the failure of their marriage.</P><P>The remaining words are considerably more formal than the foregoing and also suggest a much greater severity of <I><FONT color=brown>disapproval</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Animadversion</FONT></B> is censure of a high, authoritative and somewhat formal kind. It may suggest a single point in a more extensive <I><FONT color=brown>criticism</FONT></I>, especially one motivated by hostility: his expected <I><FONT color=brown>animadversion</FONT></I> upon the book’s risqué language; a discussion that was nothing but a string of bilious <I><FONT color=brown>animadversions</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Aspersion</FONT></B> suggests an even greater fierceness of attack than animadversion; its special emphasis is on ill-founded or reckless accusation of a defamatory nature with the implication that such <I><FONT color=brown>criticism</FONT></I> is rendered in a sneering or self-righteous manner: unfounded <I><FONT color=brown>aspersion</FONT></I> of the petitioner’s good faith; taunting her and casting <I><FONT color=brown>aspersions</FONT></I> on her truthfulness. <B><FONT color=blue>Reprehension</FONT></B>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>animadversion</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>aspersion</FONT></I>, does not imply prejudiced or unjustified <I><FONT color=brown>criticism</FONT></I> but rather indicates a stern rebuke, reproof, censure or reprimand directed against something blameworthy. <I><FONT color=brown>Reprehension</FONT></I> is supposed to be calm and just, motivated by good intentions; it is therefore a serious matter, even when mild, and is capable of great force, as expressed in the phrase severe <I><FONT color=brown>reprehension</FONT></I>.

<P>These words all mean to get rid of something that is no longer needed or wanted. <B><FONT color=blue>Discard</FONT></B>, when applied to physical objects, emphasizes the action of casting aside or throwing out: to <I><FONT color=brown>discard</FONT></I> an old pair of shoes. It stresses the worthlessness of the object so disposed of, and thus, when applied by extension to a person, conveys a large measure of contempt. When applied to ideas, discard suggests a strong and usually permanent rejection: The recommendation that nuclear weapons be used was <I><FONT color=brown>discarded</FONT></I> as reckless and uncalled-for.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Junk</FONT></B>, an informal term, means to <I><FONT color=brown>discard</FONT></I> as rubbish: to <I><FONT color=brown>junk</FONT></I> an old car. It implies that the thing <I><FONT color=brown>discarded</FONT></I> can no longer be used for its original purpose but that its materials may still be used. The metal and some parts of a <I><FONT color=brown>junked</FONT></I> car, for instance, can be re-used. <B><FONT color=blue>Scrap</FONT></B> is similar to and in more common use than <I><FONT color=brown>junk</FONT></I> in suggesting that the materials of something no longer serviceable can be re-used, but <I><FONT color=brown>scrap</FONT></I> is used almost exclusively of metal things and usually of large structures: to <I><FONT color=brown>scrap</FONT></I> an old World War II battleship. <I><FONT color=brown>Scrap</FONT></I> does not necessarily imply that the object <I><FONT color=brown>discarded</FONT></I> is worn out; it may simply be obsolete: the supersonic VT-705 jet fighter plane was <I><FONT color=brown>scrapped</FONT></I> in favour of a still faster and more manoeuvrable model. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>junk</FONT></I> <I><FONT color=brown>scrap</FONT></I> often suggests that the thing <I><FONT color=brown>discarded</FONT></I> will or might be replaced by something else, or that the putting aside is a temporary expedient: the plan for slum clearance had to be <I><FONT color=brown>scrapped</FONT></I> for lack of funds but it is hoped the new government will restore the necessary funds.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shed</FONT></B> means to cast off by a natural process, as hair, skin, etc.: snakes <I><FONT color=brown>shed</FONT></I> their skins periodically; trees <I><FONT color=brown>shedding</FONT></I> their leaves in autumn. The idea of a protective covering is retained when the word is applied figuratively to human beings: to <I><FONT color=brown>shed</FONT></I> warm clothing when summer arrives; to <I><FONT color=brown>shed</FONT></I> one’s inhibitions after a few drinks. It here suggests getting rid of something unwanted but the thing rejected is often of such a nature that it cannot be <I><FONT color=brown>discarded</FONT></I> entirely or permanently. <B><FONT color=blue>Jettison</FONT></B> is also a <I><FONT color=brown>discarding</FONT></I> or throwing-away process, but almost always as a matter of necessity, as when fuel or cargo is <I><FONT color=brown>jettisoned</FONT></I> from a plane or other vessel to lighten the load.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Reject">REJECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: keep, maintain, preserve, retain, save.</P>

<P>These words are concerned with carrying out an action. <B><FONT color=blue>Commit</FONT></B>, in this sense, is used mostly in reference to acts which are looked on with disapproval or disfavour: <I><FONT color=brown>committing</FONT></I> a crime; <I><FONT color=brown>committing</FONT></I> suicide. <B><FONT color=blue>Perpetrate</FONT></B> is even more restricted than <I><FONT color=brown>commit</FONT></I> to negative sense, meaning to be guilty of, to perform atrociously or to act deceitfully: to <I><FONT color=brown>perpetrate</FONT></I> a miscarriage of justice; to <I><FONT color=brown>perpetrate</FONT></I> such an inexcusably bad piece of writing; <I><FONT color=brown>perpetrating</FONT></I> a secret plot against the government.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dispatch</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>discharge</FONT></B> contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>commit</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>perpetrate</FONT></I> by mainly emphasizing approval for the manner in which a task is done. <I><FONT color=brown>Dispatch</FONT></I> suggests efficiency or speed of performance: <I><FONT color=brown>dispatching</FONT></I> the unpleasant job with extreme care. <I><FONT color=brown>Discharge</FONT></I> suggests the able or faultless performance of a duty or obligation: <I><FONT color=brown>discharging</FONT></I> his promise to work directly with the poor. Sometimes, however, <I><FONT color=brown>discharge</FONT></I> can suggest a literal or minimal rather than an inspired performance: <I><FONT color=brown>discharging</FONT></I> the responsibilities of his job only listlessly and reluctantly.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Do</FONT></B> is the least formal and most general of these words and carries no implications whatever about how a task is carried out: <I><FONT color=brown>doing</FONT></I> the job brilliantly; <I><FONT color=brown>doing</FONT></I> greater harm as a private citizen than he had as Prime Minister.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Perform">PERFORM</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to acts taken by someone in authority to restrain or rectify the behaviour of someone in his charge. <B><FONT color=blue>Discipline</FONT></B> in this context suggests remedial measures, harsh or mild, that are taken to cause an improvement in conduct; they are usually imposed in the form of precise regulations to govern misbehaviour: strictly <I><FONT color=brown>discipline</FONT></I> sound almost euphemistic by comparison. <B><FONT color=blue>Correct</FONT></B> refers specifically to the pointing out of error; this, of course, can be done as a help, but in this context it suggests some sort of imposed remedial measure: <I><FONT color=brown>correcting</FONT></I> his tardiness by making him stay after class. Both <I><FONT color=brown>discipline</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>correct</FONT></I> seem to imply that an obedience to imposed rules alone will "improve" behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Punish</FONT></B> is considerably more honest in its frankness, at least, by referring directly to the imposing of a penalty for undesirable performance: <I><FONT color=brown>punishing</FONT></I> her daughter by denying her a week’s allowance; arguing that prisons should rehabilitate rather than <I><FONT color=brown>punish</FONT></I> lawbreakers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chasten</FONT></B> is extremely formal but may range in suggestion from actual physical mistreatment to the imposing of any pain or affliction that leaves someone humble or tractable: the <I><FONT color=brown>chastening</FONT></I> of his careless ways by her withdrawn and bitter mood. It might particularly suggest the administering of harsh verbal reproaches: choosing a formal meeting of the board to <I><FONT color=brown>chasten</FONT></I> the office manager for his ill-advised policies. <B><FONT color=blue>Chastise</FONT></B> would now strike most ears as an outdated euphemism for physically <I><FONT color=brown>punishing</FONT></I> an inferior: a cane on the desk with which to <I><FONT color=brown>chastise</FONT></I> unruly students.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Castigate</FONT></B> suggests, as does one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>chasten</FONT></I>, a caustically severe verbal reprimand: <I><FONT color=brown>castigating</FONT></I> the secretaries for their sloppy job of filing; The inspector was <I><FONT color=brown>castigated</FONT></I> for having failed to check the electrical wiring as he was supposed to.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Rebuke">REBUKE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: applaud, <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>, reward.</P>

<P>These words all refer to an intent to alter the actions or plans of another person by means of some kind of persuasion. <B><FONT color=blue>Discourage</FONT></B> suggests an attempt to prevent or repress an action by dulling a person’s enthusiasm for it or by weakening his sense of purpose: the master <I><FONT color=brown>discouraged</FONT></I> the student from enrolling for an extra course because the student was already overworked. <I><FONT color=brown>Discourage</FONT></I> often presents a proposed action in an unfavourable light: I <I><FONT color=brown>discouraged</FONT></I> him from taking a position with that unknown and possibly unreliable insurance company. <I><FONT color=brown>Discourage</FONT></I> may also refer to actual, physical obstacles that make an action difficult if not impossible: low hedges round lawns <I><FONT color=brown>discourage</FONT></I> people from walking on the grass.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deter</FONT></B> is a stronger word than discourage. To <I><FONT color=brown>deter</FONT></I> is to prevent from acting or proceeding by the consideration of danger, difficulty or uncertainty which might counterbalance the motive for action.

<P>These words refer to an ability for making fine distinctions or to the possession of qualities that set the subject apart from others of its kind. <B><FONT color=blue>Discriminate</FONT></B> pertains mostly to someone perceiving and evaluating differences among very similar things: <I><FONT color=brown>discriminating</FONT></I> the real antique from the faked-up fraud; the connoisseur who can <I><FONT color=brown>discriminate</FONT></I> among several equally fine wines. <B><FONT color=blue>Discern</FONT></B> relates closely to <I><FONT color=brown>discriminate</FONT></I> but is somewhat pore general in stressing any intense or accurate perception without necessarily implying that it is a sorting out of closely related items: <I><FONT color=brown>discerning</FONT></I> clearly the faint trail of clues that led to the identity of the murderer.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Distinguish</FONT></B>, by contrast, can refer either to an ability of the perceiver or to the differences actually perceived. In the former case, it suggests the making of even finer distinctions than <I><FONT color=brown>discriminate</FONT></I> and making them among things even more closely resembling each other. The word, consequently, stresses the skill needed for the mere detection of differences and does not emphasize, like <I><FONT color=brown>discriminate</FONT></I>, aesthetic evaluation as a part of the process. [She was unable to <I><FONT color=brown>distinguish</FONT></I> the grey shadow she made from all the other shadows in the garden; Anyone can learn to <I><FONT color=brown>discriminate</FONT></I> between a Goya and a Velásuez but only a real student of the period can <I><FONT color=brown>distinguish</FONT></I> their stylistic tendencies.] <I><FONT color=brown>Distinguish</FONT></I>, however, when it refers to characteristics of a thing perceived is quite the opposite; in this case it suggests drastically different and often superior qualities: amazing agility that <I><FONT color=brown>distinguishes</FONT></I> him from all other dancers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Differentiate</FONT></B>, in referring to qualities in something perceived, contrasts sharply with <I><FONT color=brown>distinguish</FONT></I>, suggesting slighter differences and one seldom the result of excellence.

<P>These words agree in meaning to inflict injury or damage that spoils the appearance of a person or thing. <B><FONT color=blue>Disfigure</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mar</FONT></B>, as here considered, imply comparatively permanent injury or damage; a person’s face may be <I><FONT color=brown>disfigured</FONT></I> by scars or the surface of a desk may be <I><FONT color=brown>marred</FONT></I> by deep scratches. The two words differ in that <I><FONT color=brown>disfigure</FONT></I> suggests a change in outlines or lineaments, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>mar</FONT></I> may suggest random damage that does not substantially change appearance but may hamper effectiveness or functioning. [The church was <I><FONT color=brown>disfigured</FONT></I> by the half-built steeple; The record was so <I><FONT color=brown>marred</FONT></I> that it was almost impossible to listen to.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deface</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>blemish</FONT></B> are often used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>disfigure</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>mar</FONT></I> but often imply less permanent damage on injury; a wall may be <I><FONT color=brown>defaced</FONT></I> by pencil markings or a person’s face may be <I><FONT color=brown>blemished</FONT></I> by pimples. <I><FONT color=brown>Deface</FONT></I> nearly always suggests flaws introduced into something originally not <I><FONT color=brown>disfigured</FONT></I>; deliberate malice is often suggested as the motive: campaign posters <I><FONT color=brown>defaced</FONT></I> by graffiti.

<P>These words indicate the act of stripping someone of pride, self-respect, rank or reputation. <B><FONT color=blue>Disgrace</FONT></B> points to lowering someone in other people’s estimation: a scandal that <I><FONT color=brown>disgraced</FONT></I> both husband and wife. <B><FONT color=blue>Downgrade</FONT></B> is most frequently used to refer to a literal demotion: a sergeant <I><FONT color=brown>downgraded</FONT></I> to the rank of private; workers who felt themselves <I><FONT color=brown>downgraded</FONT></I> by the new pay award. <B><FONT color=blue>Degrade</FONT></B> may be used in this sense, but more often suggests disgusting or immoral habits or behaviour that destroys a person’s character or publicly <I><FONT color=brown>disgraces</FONT></I> him: a fine mind <I><FONT color=brown>degraded</FONT></I> and dulled by dope addiction; accusations intended to <I><FONT color=brown>degrade</FONT></I> him and destroy his reputation. <B><FONT color=blue>Humiliate</FONT></B> can refer to any inner feeling or outward act that robs someone of his self-respect: a husband who enjoyed <I><FONT color=brown>humiliating</FONT></I> his wife in public; she felt thoroughly <I><FONT color=brown>humiliated</FONT></I> at her own lack of insight.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Debase</FONT></B> suggests an action that reduces the intrinsic value of something: currency <I><FONT color=brown>debased</FONT></I> by inflationary measures; political discussion <I><FONT color=brown>debased</FONT></I> by an atmosphere of hysteria. As can be seen, <I><FONT color=brown>debase</FONT></I> may be more factual or descriptive than degrade which suggests a more thorough but more subjective or moral sort of depredation.</P><P>The remaining words all concentrate on what one does to oneself. <B><FONT color=blue>Abase</FONT></B> can suggest sycophantic grovelling or merely a ceremonial showing of respect: <I><FONT color=brown>abasing</FONT></I> himself before the hardened criminals he had been confined with; the vassal <I><FONT color=brown>abased</FONT></I> himself before the throne of his liege at the beginning of every audience. <B><FONT color=blue>Demean</FONT></B> suggests any lowering of oneself by unworthy motives or behaviour: <I><FONT color=brown>demeaning</FONT></I> himself in his eagerness to meet the famous author. This word can refer to a hostile act towards someone else: attempting to <I><FONT color=brown>demean</FONT></I> the witness by asking all sorts of extraneous questions about his personal life. <B><FONT color=blue>Humble</FONT></B> can refer to an awesome experience: feeling small and <I><FONT color=brown>humbled</FONT></I> by the sight of the Sistine murals. When not reflexive the word functions as a milder substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>humiliate</FONT></I>: trying to <I><FONT color=brown>humble</FONT></I> her husband by making him ask for every cent he spent.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Ignoble">IGNOBLE</A>, <A href="entry://Reduce">REDUCE</A>, <A href="entry://Shameful">SHAMEFUL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: compliment, exalt, praise, raise, <A href="entry://Respect">RESPECT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a willingness to listen to all sides of a case without prejudging it. <B><FONT color=blue>Disinterested</FONT></B> does not imply a lack of interest, as is sometimes mistakenly thought, but a receptive interest that does not take sides in a dispute, at least until the truth can be discovered: <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I> judges and jurors on which a just trial depends. To be <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I>, in fact, requires attentiveness to detail and an evenness of temper, though it by no means implies coldness or lack of feeling. <B><FONT color=blue>Fair</FONT></B> is much more informal than disinterested and would be more appropriate to describe a decision or a decision-maker once a verdict has been rendered: I could tell by the <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I> attitude of the judge that he would give a <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I> verdict. Also, where <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I> stresses keeping an open mind, <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I> suggests the taking of a stand based on ethical considerations: striving to remain <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I> until he could arrive at a <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I> solution to the problem.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Impartial</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unbiased</FONT></B> are more closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I> than to <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I> in emphasizing open-mindedness. <I><FONT color=brown>Impartial</FONT></I> suggests literally taking no one’s part; it implies perhaps, a greater impersonality than <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I>: a judge free of all political pressures and thus aloof enough to remain <I><FONT color=brown>impartial</FONT></I>. While very closely related, <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I> suggests someone who is inherently free of any predispositions towards conflicting sides or parties. A person who has such predispositions might still, by putting them aside, succeed in being <I><FONT color=brown>impartial</FONT></I>, but being <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I> suggests he has none to start with: a lack of contact with minorities that left him completely <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I> for or against them. In reference to reporting, <I><FONT color=brown>impartial</FONT></I> might suggest uninvolvement, while <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I> would suggest a <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I> treatment of all sides, even though a definite point of view emerges: I don’t ask a newspaper to be <I><FONT color=brown>impartial</FONT></I> but I do expect it to be <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I> at least to the extent of distinguishing between fact and opinion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dispassionate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unprejudiced</FONT></B> both emphasize the control of emotions rather than of thoughts. <I><FONT color=brown>Dispassionate</FONT></I> suggests someone unswayed by extraneous appeals designed to excite sympathy or indignation: remaining <I><FONT color=brown>dispassionate</FONT></I> amidst wild accusations of treason and favouritism. It is even more strikingly different from <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I>, however, in being applicable not only to a <I><FONT color=brown>impartial</FONT></I> judge, but to an involved contender who remains low-keyed, even-tempered and factual in argument: countering the hysteria of his opponent with a dispassionate presentation of the evidence. <I><FONT color=brown>Unprejudiced</FONT></I>, in this emotional context, relates most closely to <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>unprejudiced</FONT></I> seems more fundamental and thoroughgoing, more inclusive in stressing the absence of any irrational, deeply ingrained emotional blind spot. <I><FONT color=brown>Unprejudiced</FONT></I>, furthermore, might suggest an inward state, while <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I> would suggest the result or proof of this state in action. One could learn to behave in an <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I> way even though he were not wholly <I><FONT color=brown>unprejudiced</FONT></I>: a new law that requires <I><FONT color=brown>unbiased</FONT></I> employment practices, whether the owners of a business are <I><FONT color=brown>unprejudiced</FONT></I> or not.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Neutral</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>objective</FONT></B> both suggest an even greater distance than any of the foregoing words. <I><FONT color=brown>Neutral</FONT></I> emphasizes the taking of no sides even to the point of rendering no final judgement whatsoever: jury trials which the judge may remain <I><FONT color=brown>neutral</FONT></I> to the very end; <I><FONT color=brown>neutral</FONT></I> countries that refuse to be drawn into the cold war. <I><FONT color=brown>Objective</FONT></I> suggests an interest only in cold fact as distinct from belief, opinion or attitude; unlike <I><FONT color=brown>disinterested</FONT></I>, it may also suggest lack of feeling: the <I><FONT color=brown>objective</FONT></I> attitude of scientists that would be fatal if extended to the sphere of human responsibilities. Some writers would argue that objective is necessarily a relative rather than an absolute quality: no one can argue he is wholly <I><FONT color=brown>objective</FONT></I> about anything. Most of these words, furthermore, are approving in tone ?but only within the context of weighing and judging. They could all describe a moral weakness in other situations.

dislike
<B><FONT color=blue>dislike</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>antipathy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>aversion</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>distaste</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are alike in pointing to a negative emotional response of someone or something. <B><FONT color=blue>Dislike</FONT></B>, the most general of these words, has a wide variety of applications and can be substituted in most contexts for any of the other words here considered. It can be applied to both people and things: a <I><FONT color=brown>dislike</FONT></I> of crowds; His <I><FONT color=brown>dislike</FONT></I> for his work was matched by his enjoyment of his salary.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Distaste</FONT></B> implies a mild dislike usually stemming from temperamental or constitutional inclination. It suggests, not always accurately, that one’s taste or aesthetic sensibility has been offended by exposure to something: a <I><FONT color=brown>distaste</FONT></I> for controversy; a <I><FONT color=brown>distaste</FONT></I> for broad hats. Apart from intentionally jocular or comical contexts, <I><FONT color=brown>distaste</FONT></I> almost always describes things rather than people. It is commonly used with <I><FONT color=brown>for</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Aversion</FONT></B> is disl<I><FONT color=brown>i</FONT></I>ke that impels one to take steps to avoid the thing that offends; like <I><FONT color=brown>distaste</FONT></I>, it usually applies to things or animals rather than people. In formal contexts it more often suggests strong <I><FONT color=brown>dislike</FONT></I> amounting to a virtually uncontrollable desire to avoid: <I><FONT color=brown>aversion</FONT></I> to snakes; an <I><FONT color=brown>aversion</FONT></I> to bloodshed. In less formal context, however, it often applies to mildly irritating things: an <I><FONT color=brown>aversion</FONT></I> to sweet wine. <I><FONT color=brown>Aversion</FONT></I> is commonly used with <I><FONT color=brown>to</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Antipathy</FONT></B>, whose etymological meaning is to feel against, refers to an instinctive <I><FONT color=brown>dislike</FONT></I>. An <I><FONT color=brown>antipathy</FONT></I> is not so much irrational as non-rational ?it is simply not thought out, only felt, and may incidentally be quite supportable on rational or ethical grounds: an <I><FONT color=brown>antipathy</FONT></I> to Nazism; a natural <I><FONT color=brown>antipathy</FONT></I> to politicians.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Enmity">ENMITY</A>, <A href="entry://Repulsive">REPULSIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: like, <A href="entry://Love">LOVE</A>, penchant, predilection.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>disparate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>discordant</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>incompatible</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>incongruous</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are used to describe people or things that are dissimilar, or which do not agree or go together. <B><FONT color=blue>Disparate</FONT></B> means unlike or unequal, as in kind, quality, character or amount. It usually refers to differences that are so extreme as to make the compared people or things totally distinct: such <I><FONT color=brown>disparate</FONT></I> art forms as sculpture and the oratorio; The two facets of his personality were <I><FONT color=brown>disparate</FONT></I> enough to recall Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Discordant</FONT></B> suggests the unpleasant effect which is the result of an association of two or more musical sounds that are not in harmony or concord: a modern orchestral work that was so advanced in melodic structure as to seem not merely dissonant but <I><FONT color=brown>discordant</FONT></I>. In general application <I><FONT color=brown>discordant</FONT></I> can refer to anything that is not in agreement with any other thing, but most often it is reserved for situations which imply the presence of opposition or conflict: our chairman’s ideas about the projected expenditures were so <I><FONT color=brown>discordant</FONT></I> with those of the rest of the committee that our meeting ended in a stalemate. When people are described as <I><FONT color=brown>discordant</FONT></I> it is because they exist in a disagreeable, quarrelsome atmosphere: a <I><FONT color=brown>discordant</FONT></I> family whose children all left home to get away from their parents?constant bickering. Such people may be called <B><FONT color=blue>incompatible</FONT></B> ?that is, unable to exist or get along with each others in a pleasant or friendly way. In one way <I><FONT color=brown>incompatible</FONT></I> is a milder word than <I><FONT color=brown>discordant</FONT></I>; it does not necessarily imply the open clash or opposition to work together in a small office without open disagreement and yet be called <I><FONT color=brown>incompatible</FONT></I> because one is so much more talkative than the other that he disturbs the quiet person’s working habits. In another way, however, <I><FONT color=brown>incompatible</FONT></I> is stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>discordant</FONT></I> since the incompatibility of two persons or things often implies the impossibility of their coexistence. Two <I><FONT color=brown>discordant</FONT></I> people might stay on in a place of employment, or as part of a family unit, continually fighting but nonetheless existing together. But <I><FONT color=brown>incompatible</FONT></I> strongly suggests the inability to remain together. Thus the word is often used to describe couples whose marriage has gone on the rocks or whose contemplated marriage is thought of as unworkable. When <I><FONT color=brown>incompatible</FONT></I> is used in reference to things rather than people there is the same suggestion of an incapability of mutual existence because of a basic difference in nature: the idea that matter and spirit are <I><FONT color=brown>incompatible</FONT></I>; the use for <I><FONT color=brown>incompatible</FONT></I> colours in a painting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Incongruous</FONT></B> designates that which is not in agreement or is not suitable, reasonable or harmonious: his <I><FONT color=brown>incongruous</FONT></I> behaviour at his father’s funeral; the <I><FONT color=brown>incongruous</FONT></I> proportions of a building. It also suggests a lack of conformity, a being at odds with some accepted standard: a plan <I><FONT color=brown>incongruous</FONT></I> with reason. <I><FONT color=brown>Incongruous</FONT></I> sometimes has a connotation of the ludicrous or the absurd in the lack of agreement, harmony, conformity, etc., which it describes: the <I><FONT color=brown>incongruous</FONT></I> combination of a formal gown and sand-shoes.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Absurd">ABSURD</A>, <A href="entry://Heterogeneous">HETEROGENEOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: consistent, consonant, harmonious, identical, <A href="entry://Similar">SIMILAR</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to places considerably removed in space or time. <B><FONT color=blue>Distant</FONT></B> suggests that space is a barrier to easy contact: a country very <I><FONT color=brown>distant</FONT></I> from our own. <B><FONT color=blue>Remote</FONT></B> takes up the suggestion of mere space as a barrier, but adds to it overtones implying isolation that results from being out of the way or off the beaten track: the <I><FONT color=brown>remote</FONT></I> interior that is harder to reach than many more distant places.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inaccessible</FONT></B> almost exclusively emphasizes barriers other than sheer space itself: a short cut through the mountain that is extremely <I><FONT color=brown>inaccessible</FONT></I> in winter. <B><FONT color=blue>Far-away</FONT></B> suggests a <I><FONT color=brown>distant</FONT></I> place that might be exotic or picturesque: <I><FONT color=brown>far-away</FONT></I> islands where people live on fish and fruit, and bask all day in the sun.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Distant</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>remote</FONT></I> also can refer to separation by time: ruins that once were palaces in the <I><FONT color=brown>distant</FONT></I> past; a vanished culture <I><FONT color=brown>remote</FONT></I> from ours. In these uses, <I><FONT color=brown>remote</FONT></I> is an intensification of the lack of contact suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>distant</FONT></I>.

<B><FONT color=blue>clear</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>definite</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>distinct</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unmistakable</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to something that stands out in vivid or sharp relief from its surroundings. <B><FONT color=blue>Clear</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of these words. It suggests something that is not the least bit confused, vague or fuzzy, and therefore easy to understand or perceive: <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> directions on how to reach the hotel; the <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> lettering of the had made poster. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> may emphasize lack of confusion or ambiguity, <B><FONT color=blue>distinct</FONT></B> is restricted to sharpness of impression or lack of blur: instructions that were clear enough if only she had spoken in a more <I><FONT color=brown>distinct</FONT></I> voice. <I><FONT color=brown>Distinct</FONT></I> can also suggest well-defined outlines: the right focus for getting a <I><FONT color=brown>distinct</FONT></I> image. Or it can suggest something that stands out noticeably: the <I><FONT color=brown>distinct</FONT></I> note of annoyance in her voice.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Definite</FONT></B> relates to the lack of ambiguity implied by <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> and to the sharpness of outline or impression implied by <I><FONT color=brown>distinct</FONT></I>: setting up <I><FONT color=brown>definite</FONT></I> rules of procedure; a <I><FONT color=brown>definite</FONT></I> litmus reaction that proved the presence of acidity. <B><FONT color=blue>Unmistakable</FONT></B> intensifies the implication of <I><FONT color=brown>distinct</FONT></I> and suggests a noticeable forcefulness not to be overlooked; the word emphasizes the presence of evidence that removes all possibility for doubt: an <I><FONT color=brown>unmistakable</FONT></I> nod of her head; the <I><FONT color=brown>unmistakable</FONT></I> wail of a siren.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Definite">DEFINITE</A>, <A href="entry://Specific">SPECIFIC</A>, <A href="entry://Sure">SURE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: blurred, confused, <A href="entry://Doubtful">DOUBTFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Foggy">FOGGY</A>, fuzzy, muddled, <A href="entry://Obscure">OBSCURE</A>, unclear, unintelligible, <A href="entry://Vague">VAGUE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>distrustful</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>chary</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cynical</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>disillusioned</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>jaundiced</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mistrustful</FONT></B>:

<P>These words indicate various degrees of caution, doubt or fear that lead to a lack of faith in something or an embittered outlook. <B><FONT color=blue>Distrustful</FONT></B> refers to seemingly well-grounded suspicions of undependability or disloyalty that make one unwilling to give credence to something: inaccuracies in the report that made him <I><FONT color=brown>distrustful</FONT></I> of its conclusions; <I><FONT color=brown>distrustful</FONT></I> of adults who always spoke of how much harder they had worked when they were young. <B><FONT color=blue>Mistrustful</FONT></B> suggests a much less clear-cut suspicion, one which might amount to no more than a growing uncertainty mingled with an indefinable uneasiness and possibly even fear: more and more <I><FONT color=brown>mistrustful</FONT></I> of her companion as he led her deeper into the dense forest. <I><FONT color=brown>Distrustful</FONT></I> may suggest detached or informed judgement that guards one from taking a false step; <I><FONT color=brown>mistrustful</FONT></I> may suggest an anxious vulnerability that might already be exposed to or involved in danger because of a previous misstep.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chary</FONT></B> is more closely aligned with <I><FONT color=brown>mistrustful</FONT></I> in indicting a cautious, fussy or grudging attitude, whether it is the result of natural timidity or painful past experience. The word suggests the same uneasiness or fear as <I><FONT color=brown>mistrustful</FONT></I>, but implies a hanging back from rather than involvement in a situation: <I><FONT color=brown>chary</FONT></I> of strangers; <I><FONT color=brown>chary</FONT></I> of eating undercooked food even after the epidemic was over. <B><FONT color=blue>Disillusioned</FONT></B> specifically suggests a posture of detachment or bitterness born of past experience that has subverted one’s hopes or ideals. [Had she been more <I><FONT color=brown>distrustful</FONT></I> of his absurd promises, she wouldn’t be so <I><FONT color=brown>disillusioned</FONT></I> now; She travels with a group of teenagers who try to appear <I><FONT color=brown>disillusioned</FONT></I> and blasé about life.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cynical</FONT></B> indicates a <I><FONT color=brown>disillusioned</FONT></I> attitude that has hardened into extreme bitterness, although this may be leavened with resignation: She was <I><FONT color=brown>cynical</FONT></I> about her husband’s vow to stop drinking. The word can also point to a readiness to be distrustful on the basis of little or no evidence: <I><FONT color=brown>cynical</FONT></I> about any account of the altruism of people younger than he.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Jaundiced</FONT></B> is a more informal and colourful substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>cynical</FONT></I>, suggesting a hard-bitten sceptic who prefers to look at something or at everything from a negative point of view: he had a <I><FONT color=brown>jaundiced</FONT></I> attitude towards all proposals for slum clearance that differed in the slightest from his own; a man who was content to look at life with a <I><FONT color=brown>jaundiced</FONT></I> eye.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>, <A href="entry://Cautious">CAUTIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Doubt">DOUBT</A>, <A href="entry://Sceptic">SCEPTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Timid">TIMID</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: confident, <A href="entry://Sure">SURE</A>, trusting.</P>

<P>These group is concerned with the parcelling out of a quantity, such as money or goods, among the members of a group. <B><FONT color=blue>Divide</FONT></B> is the most general of these and says the least about what means are used in the process. When two people or groups are to share in the quantity, the word carries than you, let’s <I><FONT color=brown>divide</FONT></I> the profits between us. This is not invariably true, however, and when more than two shares are involved, the implication of equality disappears completely: thieves and pirates, according to legend, often <I><FONT color=brown>divide</FONT></I> their spoils unfairly.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Assign</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>allot</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>allocate</FONT></B> also carry no implication of a fair or equal division, but all three words suggest that someone in authority has determined how the quantity is to be <I><FONT color=brown>divided</FONT></I> among the group he represents or controls. Of these, <I><FONT color=brown>assign</FONT></I> is the least and <I><FONT color=brown>allocate</FONT></I> the most formal. <I><FONT color=brown>Assign</FONT></I> carries the strongest implication of arbitrariness on the part of the one who <I><FONT color=brown>assigns</FONT></I>. The quantity being parcelled out, furthermore is more often tasks or roles than goods or money: how many chapters did the master <I><FONT color=brown>assign</FONT></I> for homework? <I><FONT color=brown>Allot</FONT></I> implies the matching of items on one list to those on another: I’ve <I><FONT color=brown>allotted</FONT></I> six dollars a month for bus fares and twenty dollars a month for lunches. <I><FONT color=brown>Allocate</FONT></I>, as well as being the most formal of these three, is the most specific. It is most often used of a governing body’s action in setting aside a fixed sum of money for a government programme. Outside this governmental context, the word would seem forced and stiff. [Council <I><FONT color=brown>allocated</FONT></I> $200,000 for the new swimming-pool project.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Distribute</FONT></B> is most used for the dispersing of a quantity in space or among the scattered members of a group. [The paperback edition of a book is usually more widely <I><FONT color=brown>distributed</FONT></I> than the hard-cover version; This year, the company decided not to <I><FONT color=brown>distribute</FONT></I> dividends to its shareholders.]</P><P>The three remaining terms all imply a process of division that is equal, fair or judicious ?based on some fixed plan or equitable rule. <B><FONT color=blue>Ration</FONT></B> is specifically used for a method of sharing or distributing some scarce commodity when demand exceeds supply. It usually but not necessarily suggests a method of distribution based on need. [In wartime, meat and petrol are often <I><FONT color=brown>rationed</FONT></I>.] <B><FONT color=blue>Dole out</FONT></B> refers to a distribution, usually to needy or claimant people, and so carries the implication of <I><FONT color=brown>rationing</FONT></I> in small amounts or in a niggardly manner: the captain <I><FONT color=brown>dole out</FONT></I> the last of the food among his men. To <B><FONT color=blue>apportion</FONT></B> is to determine the composition of a smaller group in proportion to a larger group. It most strongly suggests a just and fair parcelling out, based on some objective standard: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional those state legislatures <I><FONT color=brown>apportioned</FONT></I> on any other basis than population.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Diversify">DIVERSIFY</A>, <A href="entry://Sever">SEVER</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: commingle, <A href="entry://Connect">CONNECT</A>, fuse, unify.</P>

<P>These words refer to a willingness to be managed, led, taught or trained. <B><FONT color=blue>Docile</FONT></B> stresses a complete lack of unruliness that makes for easy handling; the word comes from a Latin root meaning teachable and it often appears in the context of education: <I><FONT color=brown>docile</FONT></I> pupils. <B><FONT color=blue>Amenable</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests most strongly a good-willed openness to suggestions or recommendations, but the word does not imply the built-in acquiescent temperament of docile: teenagers may not be the most <I><FONT color=brown>docile</FONT></I> creatures imaginable, but they are more <I><FONT color=brown>amenable</FONT></I> to sympathetic guidance than most parents think.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tractable</FONT></B> suggests manageability to an even greater degree than <I><FONT color=brown>docile</FONT></I>. It comes from a Latin word meaning to handle; this is reflected in its use applying to the willingness of people to be led: a <I><FONT color=brown>tractable</FONT></I> audience that was willing to listen as long as the speaker had voice to exhort them with. The word can give a tone that is not very flattering to the people it describes, since it can seem to discuss human beings as though they were material or inanimate substance to be manipulated, a substance having no will of its own.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tame</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>submissive</FONT></B> point to the greatest amount of servility suggested by any of these words. With <I><FONT color=brown>tame</FONT></I>, the servility may be innate or ingrained, as with domesticated animals: a <I><FONT color=brown>tame</FONT></I> horse. A <I><FONT color=brown>tame</FONT></I> animal may, however, be far from <I><FONT color=brown>docile</FONT></I> in temperament. <I><FONT color=brown>Submissive</FONT></I> at its mildest can indicate nothing more than meek humility before one’s superiors, but in any case it suggests an extremely responsive attitude towards the needs, desires or whims of another, sometimes to the point of humiliating adjectness: the ideally <I><FONT color=brown>submissive</FONT></I> wife of the Victorian era.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adaptable">ADAPTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Compliant">COMPLIANT</A>, <A href="entry://Malleable">MALLEABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Obedient">OBEDIENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: aggressive, inflexible, <A href="entry://Stubborn">STUBBORN</A>, <A href="entry://Unruly">UNRULY</A>, <A href="entry://Wild">WILD</A>, <A href="entry://Wilful">WILFUL</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote persons engaged in treating sick or injured people. <B><FONT color=blue>Doctor</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>physician</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>surgeon</FONT></B> are all licensed practitioners of medicine who have received one or more degrees from a university medical school. <I><FONT color=brown>Doctor</FONT></I> is the most general term and is applied to all who have qualified in medicine, whether they maintain a practice or are engaged in research work or other fields in which they have no contact with patients. The title is a courtesy one, since the majority of <I><FONT color=brown>doctors</FONT></I> hold the degree of M.B. (Bachelor of Medicine). The degree of M.D. (<I><FONT color=brown>Doctor</FONT></I> of Medicine) is the highest awarded by a university medical faculty and is generally ranked higher than the degree of Ph.D. (<I><FONT color=brown>Doctor</FONT></I> of Philosophy). Few <I><FONT color=brown>doctors</FONT></I> in practice have achieved the academic distinction of M.D. (In the united States, all who qualify to practise medicine are automatically awarded the degree of M.D., but this does not correspond to the M.D. conferred by Australian and New Zealand universities.) Dentists and veterinarians also are often known by the title of <I><FONT color=brown>doctor</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>general practitioner</FONT></B> is a <I><FONT color=brown>doctor</FONT></I> with a wide general knowledge of medicine who practises in a community and who is the <I><FONT color=brown>doctor</FONT></I> first consulted by a sick person. <I><FONT color=brown>Physician</FONT></I> is a term which also may be applied to a <I><FONT color=brown>doctor</FONT></I> in general practice, but more often it means one who has taken a higher medical degree and to whom patients are referred by a <I><FONT color=brown>general practitioner</FONT></I> when necessary. Such a <I><FONT color=brown>physician</FONT></I> is known as a <B><FONT color=blue>specialist</FONT></B>, e.g., a heart <I><FONT color=brown>specialist</FONT></I>. As well as seeing patients in his or her consulting rooms, a <I><FONT color=brown>physician</FONT></I> is usually on the staff of a hospital.</P><P>In recent years medical knowledge has become such a vast field that more and more <I><FONT color=brown>doctors</FONT></I> are undergoing postgraduate training and are restricting their practice to specific fields such as paediatrics, dermatology, gynaecology and obstetrics, urology, radiology, psychiatry, etc. To these also the term <I><FONT color=brown>specialist</FONT></I> may be applied. To practise in a chosen speciality, a <I><FONT color=brown>doctor</FONT></I> will have studied for and passed an examination for a university diploma in that speciality, or for fellowship or membership of the learned college or society relating to it, such as the College of Radiologists of Australasia.</P><P>A <I><FONT color=brown>surgeon</FONT></I> is primarily concerned with diseased conditions or injuries requiring operative procedures. Thus, all surgeons are <I><FONT color=brown>specialists</FONT></I> in a general sense, in that they devote themselves to the surgical side of medicine, but some are <I><FONT color=brown>specialist</FONT></I> <I><FONT color=brown>surgeons</FONT></I> who concentrate on particular parts of the body or on certain clearly demarcated fields of surgery: an orthopaedic <I><FONT color=brown>surgeon</FONT></I>; a plastic <I><FONT color=brown>surgeon</FONT></I>.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>osteopath</FONT></B> is a practitioner of a school of healing known as osteopathy, which stresses the importance of the musculoskeletal system and its proper functioning as a basis for health. Often, his preferred method of treatment is manipulation of the muscles and bones, especially the backbone. A <B><FONT color=blue>chiropractor</FONT></B> puts a similar emphasis on the spinal area as basic to health and treats patients by the manual adjustment and manipulation of this and related areas.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Drug">DRUG</A>, <A href="entry://Healthy">HEALTHY</A>, <A href="entry://Sickness">SICKNESS</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a lack of conviction that results in a reluctance to believe something or an inability to decide. <B><FONT color=blue>Doubt</FONT></B> is the most general of these and has the widest application. It can indicate dissent from a proposition because of evidence to the contrary though this evidence falls short of being conclusive: there were growing <I><FONT color=brown>doubts</FONT></I> about the victory statement, based on scattered reports coming in from remote battle stations. More often the word indicates a lack of full assent to a proposition that evidence alone can neither confirm nor deny: he expressed considerable <I><FONT color=brown>doubt</FONT></I> that man was innately good. In this sense, a lack of faith or trust may be indicated by the word: <I><FONT color=brown>doubt</FONT></I> about the existence of God; the first <I><FONT color=brown>doubts</FONT></I> concerning her husband’s affection for her. The phrase in doubt refers to something still unsettled or in question: the result of the election remained in <I><FONT color=brown>doubt</FONT></I> until the next morning. The word, used alone, can also reflect this lack of decisiveness: tormented by <I><FONT color=brown>doubt</FONT></I>, he stood at the intersection of the two paths, not knowing which to take.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dubiety</FONT></B> can function as a considerably more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>doubt</FONT></I>. The word may impart the notion of actively calling something into question rather than simply being passively unsure: a touch of <I><FONT color=brown>dubiety</FONT></I> in his voice as he asked her to repeat her outrageous accusation. On the other hand, the word can suggest a wavering between conclusions.</P><P>This last possibility for dubiety makes it a more formal substitute for <B><FONT color=blue>uncertainty</FONT></B>, which stresses wavering indecision for whatever reason, particularly as it relates to choice or outcome: she expressed <I><FONT color=brown>uncertainty</FONT></I> about which man she should marry. <B><FONT color=blue>Suspicion</FONT></B> more often concentrates on a single possibility, rather than on alternatives, and indicates a questioning uncertainty that something is what it purports to be: the first <I><FONT color=brown>suspicions</FONT></I> that their marriage would fail.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scepticism</FONT></B> is considerably more decisive in tone than the other words here, pointing to an unwavering posture of doubt until faced with undeniable proof: He greeted her protestations of innocence with amused <I><FONT color=brown>scepticism</FONT></I>. Often the word suggests a rationalistic or scientific attitude ?or an irreverent attitude towards the claims of religion or the occult: the necessary <I><FONT color=brown>scepticism</FONT></I> of the science towards new scientific theories; talking to the medium had only increased his <I><FONT color=brown>scepticism</FONT></I> about spiritualism.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Unbelief">UNBELIEF</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: assurance, certainty, confidence, conviction.</P>

<P>These words relate to suspicion, indecision or a lack of clarity. <B><FONT color=blue>Doubtful</FONT></B> can function in all three of these areas. [She was <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I> of his good intentions; Still <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I> about which plane to take; The outcome of his appeal is still <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I>.] The word can also be used as an indefinite way to impugn the worth or value of something: a man of <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I> habits; a book of <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I> merit. <B><FONT color=blue>Dubious</FONT></B> is closely related to this last use of <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I>, but it carries a greater air of veiled insinuation and, relating to morals, may have more sinister overtones: a <I><FONT color=brown>dubious</FONT></I> person. The phrase, a <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I> person, by contrast, would pertain to someone who did not know what to do. Similarly, an outcome that was <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I> would be one not vet decided: a <I><FONT color=brown>dubious</FONT></I> outcome would be an undesirable one. Referring to hesitation, the word may suggest less basis on which to choose, but this may be accompanied by a sense of greater suspicion, wariness or even danger: She was beginning to be <I><FONT color=brown>dubious</FONT></I> about the man’s claim to be a window-cleaner. <B><FONT color=blue>Questionable</FONT></B> can be used euphemistically in reference to immorality: a house where <I><FONT color=brown>questionable</FONT></I> activities were conducted. In other uses, it points to something genuinely open to doubt, analysis or criticism: a <I><FONT color=brown>questionable</FONT></I> foreign policy.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Uncertain</FONT></B> can refer, most simply, to an inability to choose: <I><FONT color=brown>uncertain</FONT></I> about which dress to wear. The word also applies to a lack of clarity or evidence or to an unforeseeable outcome: an <I><FONT color=brown>uncertain</FONT></I> legend on the rusted sign; an <I><FONT color=brown>uncertain</FONT></I> dating of the new fossil discoveries; these <I><FONT color=brown>uncertain</FONT></I> times, in which there is little to be hoped for and much to be feared. <B><FONT color=blue>Problematic</FONT></B> emphasizes one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>uncertain</FONT></I>, referring to something that cannot be definitely established by the available evidence: The ultimate origins of the Aztec and Mayan cultures are likely to remain <I><FONT color=brown>problematic</FONT></I>. The word can also pertain to results that are endangered or unclear because of an attendant pattern of complex causality: Multilateral approval on each item of a nuclear-control agreement tends to make disarmament <I><FONT color=brown>problematic</FONT></I>.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>ambiguous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>equivocal</FONT></B> concentrate on a lack of clarity. <I><FONT color=brown>Ambiguous</FONT></I> can refer to either an intentional or unintentional failure to be precise or definite. [He kept making <I><FONT color=brown>ambiguous</FONT></I> remarks instead of straightforward yes-or-no replies; In explaining his stand, he only made everything more <I><FONT color=brown>ambiguous</FONT></I> than it had been to begin with.] <I><FONT color=brown>Equivocal</FONT></I> stresses an intentional wish to remain unclear, the word can, in fact, suggest deliberate deception or the saying of one thing while meaning another. [She kept putting him off half-heatedly with <B><FONT color=blue>equivocal</FONT></B> replies to his proposal.] At its strongest, the word suggests something that might be thought of as morally compromising: They advised their daughter against putting herself in <I><FONT color=brown>equivocal</FONT></I> situations when she was out on dates. But the word can also apply to what is merely uncertain, unprovable or of <I><FONT color=brown>doubtful</FONT></I> validity, even when <I><FONT color=brown>dubious</FONT></I> motives are absent: statistical factors that make even the most scrupulous public-opinion polls <I><FONT color=brown>equivocal</FONT></I> in their findings.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Confuse">CONFUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Unwise">UNWISE</A>, <A href="entry://Vague">VAGUE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clear">CLEAR</A>, confident, decided, <A href="entry://Definite">DEFINITE</A>, <A href="entry://Sure">SURE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to covering worn on the body. <B><FONT color=blue>Dress</FONT></B> is the outer covering for both men and women, especially when suitable for a formal occasion: evening <I><FONT color=brown>dress</FONT></I>, court <I><FONT color=brown>dress</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Dress</FONT></I> may be used specifically to mean the skirt and bodice, usually in one piece, worn by women and girls.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Clothes</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>clothing</FONT></B> are more general terms. <I><FONT color=brown>Clothing</FONT></I> denotes the entire covering taken as a whole. [In winter children need warm <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I>; Natives in hot climates tend to wear little or no <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Clothing</FONT></I> need not be limited to the persons wearing it, but may suggest the manufacturer or retailer: a factory that makes children’s <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I>; a second-hand <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I> store; a sale of winter <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Clothes</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>garments</FONT></B>, one the other hand, suggest that coverings worn on the body are made up of separate parts. When one speaks admiringly of a woman as having beautiful <I><FONT color=brown>clothes</FONT></I>, one means that everything she wears ?coats, dresses, suits, shoes, hats, etc. ?is in excellent taste and of high quality and is also very becoming to the wearer. <I><FONT color=brown>Clothes</FONT></I> may also be designed especially for various activities or for persons in a certain condition or time of life: sports <I><FONT color=brown>clothes</FONT></I>; school <I><FONT color=brown>clothes</FONT></I>; maternity <I><FONT color=brown>clothes</FONT></I>, but it may also be a piece of underclothing with a distinct function: a foundation <I><FONT color=brown>garment</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Garment</FONT></I> may also apply as an attributive to clothing in general, and especially to its manufacture: the <I><FONT color=brown>garment</FONT></I> industry.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>costume</FONT></B> is the characteristic <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I> worn by the people of a given region, time or group: the national <I><FONT color=brown>costume</FONT></I> of Bavaria; Elizabethan <I><FONT color=brown>costume</FONT></I>; cowboy <I><FONT color=brown>costume</FONT></I>. In this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>dress</FONT></I> is sometimes used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>costume</FONT></I>: T. E. Lawrence often wore Arab <I><FONT color=brown>dress</FONT></I> in the desert. In its second sense, <I><FONT color=brown>costume</FONT></I> can also refer to the <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I> worn by an actor during the playing of a role or by a person posing as an imaginary character in any situation. [As Hamlet, Olivier wore a <I><FONT color=brown>costume</FONT></I> of black velvet and a long gold chain round his neck; My cousin went to the party in a pirate <I><FONT color=brown>costume</FONT></I>.] <B><FONT color=blue>Garb</FONT></B>, a rather literary word, is used chiefly with reference to the <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I> characteristic of a profession or rank: the <I><FONT color=brown>garb</FONT></I> of a priest; kingly <I><FONT color=brown>garb</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Apparel</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>attire</FONT></B> are chiefly used of complete and elegant outer <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I>, although dress has largely supplanted them in this sense. <I><FONT color=brown>Apparel</FONT></I> (which is often rendered as <I><FONT color=brown>wearing apparel</FONT></I>) is a somewhat formal word for both <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>clothes</FONT></I>. It carries more of the suggestion of a collection of separate <I><FONT color=brown>garments</FONT></I> in which a person is clad than does <I><FONT color=brown>attire</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Attire</FONT></I> often stresses the impression that one’s <I><FONT color=brown>clothes</FONT></I> may make upon others: the rich <I><FONT color=brown>attire</FONT></I> of a Renaissance pope; the strange <I><FONT color=brown>attire</FONT></I> of the eccentric old woman.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gear</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>togs</FONT></B> are much more informal words for <I><FONT color=brown>clothes</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Togs</FONT></I> is rather old-fashioned and, when used, refers in nearly all cases to swimming <I><FONT color=brown>costume</FONT></I>. Even in this swimming sense, <I><FONT color=brown>gear</FONT></I> has largely taken over from <I><FONT color=brown>togs</FONT></I>, and as well as referring to <I><FONT color=brown>clothing</FONT></I> in general, can be specific: Modern <I><FONT color=brown>gear</FONT></I> does not suit stout or older men; riding <I><FONT color=brown>gear</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Stylish">STYLISH</A>, <A href="entry://Vogue">VOGUE</A>.</P>

<P>These words relate to substances, natural or synthetic, that are intended to aid in the diagnosis, prevention, treatment or cure of physical and mental disorders.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Drug</FONT></B> is the most general, being applicable to any substance serving those purposes. [The doctor prescribed a new <I><FONT color=brown>drug</FONT></I> for his patient; Many <I><FONT color=brown>drugs</FONT></I> have been used in the treatment of malaria.] The plural form carries an added suggestion of improper or excessive use: an addiction to <I><FONT color=brown>drugs</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Medicine</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>remedy</FONT></B> are close synonyms for <I><FONT color=brown>drug</FONT></I>, but both may be extended to other agencies or procedures supposedly conductive to health. [Sunshine and rest are good <I><FONT color=brown>medicine</FONT></I> for convalescents: The best <I><FONT color=brown>remedy</FONT></I> for overweight is careful dieting.] <B><FONT color=blue>Medicament</FONT></B> is a learned variant of <I><FONT color=brown>medicine</FONT></I>, seldom used nowadays. <B><FONT color=blue>Medicinal</FONT></B>, known chiefly as an adjective, is being increasingly used as a noun by commercial enterprises concerned with the manufacture and marketing of <I><FONT color=brown>drugs</FONT></I>: the export of <I><FONT color=brown>medicinals</FONT></I> to South-East Asia.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Biological</FONT></B>, generally used in the plural, also has gained a foothold as a substantive. It denotes a class of <I><FONT color=brown>drugs</FONT></I> prepared from living animal sources and usually administered under medical supervision: serums, vaccines and hormone products may now be referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>biological</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Ethical</FONT></B> applies to "elite" <I><FONT color=brown>drug</FONT></I> preparations (including <I><FONT color=brown>medicinals</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>biologicals</FONT></I>), which in most cases are obtainable only from chemists and on prescription. <B><FONT color=blue>Pharmaceutical</FONT></B> describes all medical remedies made by <I><FONT color=brown>drug</FONT></I> firms, from the <I><FONT color=brown>ethicals</FONT></I> available at the chemist’s down to the proprietary lines, such as cough medicine, sold by the self-service grocery.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Narcotic</FONT></B>, in the medical sense of the word, is a drug that has limited, often variable capacity to relive pain or induce sleep; morphine, codeine and certain other opium derivatives are <I><FONT color=brown>narcotics</FONT></I>. It is this power, together with a strong habit-forming tendency, that has led to their widespread abuse and given both the drug and the word a bad name: the traffic in <I><FONT color=brown>narcotics</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>narcotic</FONT></I> addiction. <B><FONT color=blue>Specific</FONT></B>, as the word implies, refers to any <I><FONT color=brown>drug</FONT></I> or medicinal that is adapted for the treatment, alleviation or cure of some clearly identified abnormal condition. [Digitalis is a <I><FONT color=brown>specific</FONT></I> for many kinds of heart disease: The best <I><FONT color=brown>specific</FONT></I> for the control of diabetes mellitus is insulin.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Medication</FONT></B> has become popular as a generic term for anything that is given or administered to a patient undergoing therapy. This eliminates the possible unpleasantness of drug when it might be mistaken as applying to <I><FONT color=brown>narcotic</FONT></I> addiction rather than to prescribed treatment: nurses responsible for giving each patient the <I><FONT color=brown>medication</FONT></I> specified by his doctor; a new <I><FONT color=brown>medication</FONT></I> to combat <I><FONT color=brown>drug</FONT></I> addiction. It can apply widely from the simplest remedies, such as aspirin, to the most complex. Also, it refers less harshly to the tranquillizers and other <I><FONT color=brown>drugs</FONT></I> used to control the symptoms of mental disorder, where a cure is not possible or pragmatic: hospital bed-space freed by handling many of the mentally ill as out-patients who can be maintained by a programme of regular <I><FONT color=brown>medication</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Doctor">DOCTOR</A>, <A href="entry://Healthy">HEALTHY</A>, <A href="entry://Sickness">SICKNESS</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things lacking in moisture. <B><FONT color=blue>Dry</FONT></B> is the most general, being equally suitable for describing solids, atmospheres or climates: She wiped the dish until it was <I><FONT color=brown>dry</FONT></I>, hot air in the sauna; South Australia’s <I><FONT color=brown>dry</FONT></I> climate. The remaining words all stress that something containing moisture has been rendered <I><FONT color=brown>dry</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Dried</FONT></B> is commonly used to describe foods from which moisture has been partially or totally removed as a way of preserving them: <I><FONT color=brown>dried</FONT></I> beef; <I><FONT color=brown>dried</FONT></I> peas; <I><FONT color=brown>dried</FONT></I> apricots. In some cases, preparation involves restoring water to the product, as with peas; in other cases, the food is used as it is. <B><FONT color=blue>Dehydrated</FONT></B> is a more formal and technical term for the same idea, although it more often applies, in this sense, to foods that have not only been dried, but powdered as well: <I><FONT color=brown>dehydrated</FONT></I> milk; <I><FONT color=brown>dehydrated</FONT></I> eggs. In other senses, the word can indicate an unwanted loss of moisture: a fever that had caused his body to become dangerously <I><FONT color=brown>dehydrated</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Parched</FONT></B> is a much less formal term that concentrate exclusively on this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>dehydrated</FONT></I>, referring to an undesirable or uncomfortable lack of or need for water: the <I><FONT color=brown>parched</FONT></I>, drought-stricken countryside; He had gulped down the last of the water in his canteen, but still felt <I><FONT color=brown>parched</FONT></I> with thirst.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crisp</FONT></B> applies almost exclusively to brittle or shrivelled solids, particularly those in thin sheets or layers. Also, the word suggests that this <I><FONT color=brown>dry</FONT></I>, brittle state has been arrived at by heating or cooking: <I><FONT color=brown>crisp</FONT></I> potato chips; the steak she had burnt to a <I><FONT color=brown>crisp</FONT></I>. This is not always true, however: <I><FONT color=brown>crisp</FONT></I> autumn leaves. <B><FONT color=blue>Dehumidified</FONT></B> is comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>dehydrated</FONT></I> in formality and would seem identical in meaning, but whereas <I><FONT color=brown>dehydrated</FONT></I> applies to solids, <I><FONT color=brown>dehumidified</FONT></I> most often applies exclusively to atmosphere: the amount of <I><FONT color=brown>dehumidified</FONT></I> air that an air conditioner can put out. <B><FONT color=blue>Desiccated</FONT></B> can function as a much more formal substitute for dried: <I><FONT color=brown>desiccated</FONT></I> yeast. Much more often, however, the word is used in metaphorical ways, suggesting something wasted, old, dried up, lifeless or dull: the <I><FONT color=brown>desiccated</FONT></I> old fuddy-duddy. <I><FONT color=brown>Dry</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>crisp</FONT></I> also have metaphorical uses. <I><FONT color=brown>Crisp</FONT></I> can suggest a brusque, sharp or efficient manner: She rejected his proposal with a <I><FONT color=brown>crisp</FONT></I> remark; the <I><FONT color=brown>crisp</FONT></I> smile of the airline hostess. <I><FONT color=brown>Dry</FONT></I> has extremely wide range of metaphorical uses. It can indicate anything droll, boring or lacking in humour: a <I><FONT color=brown>dry</FONT></I> remark, given with a deadpan expression; a <I><FONT color=brown>dry</FONT></I> book. The word can also refer to an alcoholic drink that is free of sweetness: a <I><FONT color=brown>dry</FONT></I> martini.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hot">HOT</A>, <A href="entry://Sterile">STERILE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: damp, deliquescent, moist, soggy, wet.</P>

<P>These words refer to an exact or approximate rendering of an original. <B><FONT color=blue>Copy</FONT></B> is the most general of these, applying both to exact and inexact renderings: a carbon <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I> of the letter; a Roman <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I> of the original Greek statue; manufacturers who mass-produce <I><FONT color=brown>copies</FONT></I> of Paris fashions; a poorly executed counterfeit <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Duplicate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>replica</FONT></B>, by contrast, specifically stress the exactness of the <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Duplicate</FONT></I> may suggest an exact and valid replacement: applying for a <I><FONT color=brown>duplicate</FONT></I> of his lost passport. It may even refer more particularly to one of two identical things: sorting through his library for <I><FONT color=brown>duplicates</FONT></I>; a frieze that is the <I><FONT color=brown>duplicate</FONT></I> of one on the front of the building. In less precise usage, the word may shade off in reference merely to things that resemble each other, or to an accurate <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I>; an obelisk that is the <I><FONT color=brown>duplicate</FONT></I> of several in Egypt; a <I><FONT color=brown>duplicate</FONT></I> of the bill of lading. <I><FONT color=brown>Replica</FONT></I>, most precisely, refers to a <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I> made by the creator of the original: Rodin’s habit of making a number of <I><FONT color=brown>replicas</FONT></I> each time he cast a statue. As in this example, any sense of original and <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I> is obliterated. More loosely, however, the word is simply a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I>; it may even be popularly understood to mean a rough approximation: a <I><FONT color=brown>replica</FONT></I> of what an Elizabethan theatre must have looked like. When <I><FONT color=brown>replica</FONT></I> is used in the sense of a small trophy held by a competitor instead of the original, there may not be any similarity between the two.</P><P>Though more formal, <B><FONT color=blue>facsimile</FONT></B> is almost as general as <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I>, since the degree of exactness is not specified. Often the word is used to indicate only a schematic approximation of an original: a contest anyone can enter by sending a soap wrapper or a reasonable <I><FONT color=brown>facsimile</FONT></I> thereof. Even in other uses, the word always suggests easily noticeable differences between original and the <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Reproduction</FONT></B> is also vague about the degree of accuracy implied. Sometimes the stress is on a close resemblance to the original: a remarkably skilful <I><FONT color=brown>reproduction</FONT></I> of the original painting. Often, however, the word may be used to suggest a simplified or less expensive version of a prototype: applauding hand-sewn showpieces that will deluge the country as machine-stitched <I><FONT color=brown>reproductions</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Model</FONT></B> is unique among these words in specifically indicating an approximate rendering; the word suggests a schematic approximation, often of reduced scale, that may precede supersonic transport plane; a working <I><FONT color=brown>model</FONT></I> of the new turbine. The word, in any case, seldom suggests the kind of <I><FONT color=brown>copy</FONT></I> that could be mistaken for the original; a functional or illustrative mock-up is more often indicated: using models of the space capsules to show the manoeuvring involved in "docking" ?bringing them together in space.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Counterpart">COUNTERPART</A>, <A href="entry://Duplicate">DUPLICATE</A>, <A href="entry://Sample">SAMPLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Prototype">PROTOTYPE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a state of extreme readiness and interest in some prospective action or subject, suggesting one’s willingness to become involved in it. <B><FONT color=blue>Eager</FONT></B> may suggest a general thirst for experience of all kinds or an intense interest of a more specific nature: young, <I><FONT color=brown>eager</FONT></I> students ready to take on the world; <I><FONT color=brown>eager</FONT></I> for his first look round Paris. While the word most often suggests a period before involvement is possible, it may also describe the intensity of involvement itself: an <I><FONT color=brown>eager</FONT></I> lover. <B><FONT color=blue>Intent</FONT></B> relates to this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>eager</FONT></I>, suggesting an undivided concentration on the activity itself: <I><FONT color=brown>intent</FONT></I> on the book he was reading. It may also suggest a purposeful and determined search for something that interests one: <I><FONT color=brown>intent</FONT></I> on finding the café he had read about in magazines.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Avid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>desirous</FONT></B> both pertain mostly to the period before involvement. Both may refer to an intense longing or craving, but <I><FONT color=brown>desirous</FONT></I> might now seem old-fashioned or archaic-sounding to many: <I><FONT color=brown>desirous</FONT></I> of her hand in marriage. <I><FONT color=brown>Avid</FONT></I> still retains it forcefulness as in intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>eager</FONT></I>, suggesting a craving on the point of desperation: <I><FONT color=brown>avid</FONT></I> for new of the city; the <I><FONT color=brown>avid</FONT></I> reader of science-fiction. Like <I><FONT color=brown>eager</FONT></I>, it may also describe actual involvement, but again with greater intensity: He dispatched the meal with a series of <I><FONT color=brown>avid</FONT></I> gulps.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Keen</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>enthusiastic</FONT></B> both may suggest an extreme liking for or approval of something. <I><FONT color=brown>Keen</FONT></I> best describes <I><FONT color=brown>eager</FONT></I> involvement: children who watched the clowns with <I><FONT color=brown>keen</FONT></I> delight. Much more informally, the word indicates a special liking or appetite for something: <I><FONT color=brown>keen</FONT></I> on mystery stories. <I><FONT color=brown>Enthusiastic</FONT></I> is unique among these words in applying mostly to participation rather than expectation, or to a favourable verdict on something already experienced or proposed. For example, a person can be <I><FONT color=brown>eager</FONT></I> for a holiday and <I><FONT color=brown>enthusiastic</FONT></I> about the plans he was made, but he cannot be <I><FONT color=brown>enthusiastic</FONT></I> about the holiday itself until it is under way or over. Thus the word pertains to activity undertaken with gusto, verve and exuberance, or to an extremely favourable judgement that contains few reservations: an <I><FONT color=brown>enthusiastic</FONT></I> group of mountain-climbers; <I><FONT color=brown>enthusiastic</FONT></I> reviews of his book.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>, <A href="entry://Preoccupied">PREOCCUPIED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impassive">IMPASSIVE</A>, indifferent, listless, uninterested, <A href="entry://Uninvolved">UNINVOLVED</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the partaking of food. <B><FONT color=blue>Eat</FONT></B> is the most general, applying equally well to man or animal; the woman <I><FONT color=brown>eating</FONT></I> a hot dog; horses <I><FONT color=brown>eating</FONT></I> chaff. Only context can give further details: slowly <I><FONT color=brown>eating</FONT></I> his breakfast of bacon and eggs; <I><FONT color=brown>eating</FONT></I> his dessert almost in one gulp.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dine</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sup</FONT></B> are relatively formal; both specifically refer to <I><FONT color=brown>eating</FONT></I> done by people. <I><FONT color=brown>Dine</FONT></I> can point to the day’s main meal: She <I><FONT color=brown>ate</FONT></I> a light lunch so that she would be able to <I><FONT color=brown>dine</FONT></I> later without a guilty conscience. Or the word can refer to any formal or special meal: She asked her husband’s employer to <I><FONT color=brown>dine</FONT></I> with them next week. <I><FONT color=brown>Sup</FONT></I> now sounds archaic and, worse, pretentious, though once it could refer to an evening or late evening meal: They had a nightcap and <I><FONT color=brown>supped</FONT></I> on left-overs once the guests were gone.</P><P>Unlike the preceding pair, <B><FONT color=blue>consume</FONT></B> can refer to either man or animal, but its point in either case is the thoroughness of the <I><FONT color=brown>eating</FONT></I>, suggesting the utter and avid taking in of a food: a pack of lions able to <I><FONT color=brown>consume</FONT></I> the whole carass of an impala in a single night; The hungry boy <I><FONT color=brown>consumed</FONT></I> every last scrap on his plate. Thus, the word can apply to any process that involves total destruction and in which one thing can be seen as feeding off another: The raging fever that was <I><FONT color=brown>consuming</FONT></I> her body. <B><FONT color=blue>Gorge</FONT></B> compares to <I><FONT color=brown>consume</FONT></I>, but stresses <I><FONT color=brown>eating</FONT></I> or even overeating to the point of satiety or possibly discomfort, suggesting the gluttonous and indiscriminate stuffing down of food: the sleepy hounds lying about <I><FONT color=brown>gorged</FONT></I> with food; the fat man who <I><FONT color=brown>gorged</FONT></I> himself constantly with mountainous desserts.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gobble</FONT></B> emphasizes rapid eating rather than the thoroughness indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>consume</FONT></I> or the excessiveness possible for <I><FONT color=brown>gorge</FONT></I>: chickens who <I><FONT color=brown>gobbled</FONT></I> down the scattered breadcrumbs in a twinkling; He warned the girl that she’d get sick if she <I><FONT color=brown>gobbled</FONT></I> her food that way. <B><FONT color=blue>Wolf</FONT></B> also emphasizes quickness, but it indicates a ravenous ferocity or desperation, as well. Since its obvious metaphor pertaining to one animal might make the word tautological in that instance and inappropriate in others, the main point of the word is to describe human <I><FONT color=brown>eating</FONT></I> in terms of a <I><FONT color=brown>wolf’s</FONT></I> swift and rapacious feeding: <I><FONT color=brown>wolfing</FONT></I> down one canape after another as though he were starving; a film that depicted Henry VIII <I><FONT color=brown>wolfing</FONT></I> down an incredible array of viands.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Devour</FONT></B> can apply equally well to animals or men, though it is more general in its implications than the preceding, suggesting either the total consumption of something or the rapidity with which it is <I><FONT color=brown>eaten</FONT></I>: kittens that devoured the whole plate of catfood before the dozing mother cat could stir; hungry soldiers who <I><FONT color=brown>devoured</FONT></I> the tasteless braised steak ladled out to them by the mess orderly. Like <I><FONT color=brown>consume</FONT></I>, this word can have metaphorical uses, referring in this case to eager or enthusiastic taking in or, possibly, to the predatory destruction of something. [She <I><FONT color=brown>devoured</FONT></I> her French lessons so that she would be proficient by the time of her first trip abroad; All their assets were <I><FONT color=brown>devoured</FONT></I> by an unscrupulous loan shark.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Absorb">ABSORB</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>eccentricity</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>idiosyncrasy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>oddity</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>quirk</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all denote an aspect or peculiarity of a person’s character or manner. <B><FONT color=blue>Eccentricity</FONT></B> is used to identify a characteristic, action, practice or habit that differs in some way from what is usual or expected; the word suggests a strangeness or irregularity that may be harmless but that is an ingrained part of the personality. [Smoking cigars was part of the old lady’s <I><FONT color=brown>eccentricity</FONT></I>; One of his <I><FONT color=brown>eccentricities</FONT></I> was a stubborn reluctance to entrust his savings to a bank.] By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>quirk</FONT></B> is the most general of this group and suggests little as to the nature or the trait involved; <I><FONT color=brown>quirks</FONT></I> can be pleasant or unpleasant, amusing or irritating: Knuckle-cracking was his most annoying <I><FONT color=brown>quirk</FONT></I>. The word originally referred to a kind of verbal trick or conceit. Bright retorts, plays on words, subtle evasions, all were described as <I><FONT color=brown>quirks</FONT></I>. Although the term can be and still is used in this way, it more often now designates a distinctive trait of behaviour rather than of speech. In any case, the word can suggest a slight slip, flaw or distortion: a keen mind, but one full of <I><FONT color=brown>quirks</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Idiosyncrasies</FONT></B> are like <I><FONT color=brown>eccentricities</FONT></I> in that they are strange in nature, but the word implies less a divergence from the general than an emphasis on the individual. <I><FONT color=brown>Eccentricities</FONT></I> are often an indication of mental aberration, <I><FONT color=brown>idiosyncrasies</FONT></I> the evidence of a strongly independent personality: His refusal to wear a tie at work in the summer is one of my uncle’s most admirable <I><FONT color=brown>idiosyncrasies</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Oddity</FONT></B> is interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>eccentricity</FONT></I> because of its suggestion of the aberrant and peculiar. However, the word is more often used to designate an odd or unique person or thing than a quality or trait. [What a collection of <I><FONT color=brown>oddities</FONT></I> he invited to his party!; A bargain is an <I><FONT color=brown>oddity</FONT></I> in that store; all their merchandise is overpriced.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Characteristic">CHARACTERISTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Flaw">FLAW</A>, <A href="entry://Temperament">TEMPERAMENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: commonness, conventionality, normality, ordinariness, typicality.</P>

<P>These words refer to the bounding line or outline of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Edge</FONT></B> refers to the thin line along one side of a thing: the <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I> of the table; the south <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I> of the terrace. Or it may refer to the line between two sides or planes: the <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I> of an axe. In either case the word refers to a line that does not circumscribe a figure but may form part of its perimeter. As such, it can refer to any sort of boundary: the ragged <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I> of the forest. Unqualified, however, the word often suggest a straight or sharp line: He tested the <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I> of the knife with one finger. Metaphorically, the word may indicate the shape line between two contrasting qualities or states or, particularly; the line delimiting an undesirable state: nations drifting closer to the <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I> of disaster.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brink</FONT></B> also indicates a line that is not circumscribing, but the word’s stress is on an abrupt division between high and low ground: the <I><FONT color=brown>brink</FONT></I> of the cliff; the <I><FONT color=brown>brink</FONT></I> of a valley. <B><FONT color=blue>Verge</FONT></B> once could refer literally either to a dividing or circumscribing line in as general a way as <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I>, but now it is almost completely limited to metaphorical uses. Here, it suggests the imminence or nearness of an abrupt shift to some other condition, good or bad: on the <I><FONT color=brown>verge</FONT></I> of succeeding at last; on the <I><FONT color=brown>verge</FONT></I> of a nervous breakdown. <I><FONT color=brown>Brink</FONT></I> functions similarly in a metaphorical way, except that it almost exclusively applies to the imminence of something undesirable: on the <I><FONT color=brown>brink</FONT></I> of war. It may also suggest speed, inevitability and possible destruction such as would be true in falling over a literal chasm: In international affairs, brinkmanship is the tactic of risking nuclear confrontation in the hope that one can stop short in time without plummeting headlong over the <I><FONT color=brown>brink</FONT></I>.</P><P>All the remaining words can refer to a circumscribing outline. <B><FONT color=blue>Border</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>margin</FONT></B>, furthermore, most often refer to plane figures. <I><FONT color=brown>Border</FONT></I> can indicate the area of such a figure that is nearest to its outside <I><FONT color=brown>edges</FONT></I>: They walked about the <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I> of the park. The word can also refer to a circumscribing boundary that contrasts distinctly with what it encloses and thus sets off or frames the contained area: a black <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I> round the portrait of the dead sovereign; a modest <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I> of lawn round the house. In this sense, the word may imply an added, decorative <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I>: the lace border of her handkerchief. <I><FONT color=brown>Boarder</FONT></I> can, however, refer like <I><FONT color=brown>edge</FONT></I> to a dividing line, as in its common use for the boundary between two countries: the <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I> between Canada and the United States. <I><FONT color=brown>Margin</FONT></I> emphasizes exclusively one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I>, pointing to the outer area circumscribing something, an area that is often distinct in appearance from what it encloses. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>border</FONT></I>, however, <I><FONT color=brown>margin</FONT></I> more frequently refers to the emptiness, blankness or lack of decoration that sets off and surrounds something. Typescript looks best when at least an inch of <I><FONT color=brown>margin</FONT></I> is left on all four sides of the page. To this implication of space left unused can be added the notion of its being saved for an emergency: <I><FONT color=brown>margin</FONT></I> for error.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rim</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>brim</FONT></B> also refer to a circumscribing outline, in this case that of a circle. <I><FONT color=brown>Rim</FONT></I> refers most specifically to the open lip of a cylindrical or rounded shape: She tested the <I><FONT color=brown>rim</FONT></I> of the glass to see if it was chipped; on the <I><FONT color=brown>rim</FONT></I> of the volcano. <I><FONT color=brown>Brim</FONT></I> can refer to the same open lip, but is most often associated with a situation in which a container is completely filled: a teacup filled to the <I><FONT color=brown>brim</FONT></I>. This use extends to shapes that are not rounded: rail trucks filled to the <I><FONT color=brown>brim</FONT></I> with grain. But <I><FONT color=brown>brim</FONT></I> has at least one use where it functions more like border or margin: the <I><FONT color=brown>brim</FONT></I> of a hat.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boundary">BOUNDARY</A>, <A href="entry://Circumscribe">CIRCUMSCRIBE</A>, <A href="entry://Perimeter">PERIMETER</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Centre">CENTRE</A>, interior.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>effect</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cause</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>produce</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>realize</FONT></B>:

<P>These words pertain to the accomplishing of results. <B><FONT color=blue>Effect</FONT></B> can refer to the successful accomplishment of an intended action: The pilot <I><FONT color=brown>effected</FONT></I> a take-off despite the bomb-pocked runway. As in this example, the point of this use is often the overcoming of difficulty or a previous uncertainty as to outcome. The word can also indicate putting into practice a previously formulated goal: We <I><FONT color=brown>effected</FONT></I> the plan with a minimum of fuss. No sense of difficulty or uncertainty need be implied here. When <I><FONT color=brown>effect</FONT></I> applies, however, to the formulating of a plan, goal or solution, rather than to putting one into action, the word takes on a different set of overtones: a board of mediators to <I><FONT color=brown>effect</FONT></I> a compromise in the newspaper strike. While initial resistance is implied, the goal reached is not necessarily known at the outset, but is arrived at through experiments, innovation and improvisation. Also, the word sometimes suggests a rough-and-ready or expedient result, if not a jerry-built one: ready to <I><FONT color=brown>effect</FONT></I> a solution to the problem by any means available.</P><P>By contrast, the desired objective implied by <B><FONT color=blue>realize</FONT></B> is always seen in advance, at least in the sense pertinent here: to <I><FONT color=brown>realize</FONT></I> a long-standing dream. The stress of the word in fact, is on making actual or real something that has previously existed only as a plan or desire. <B><FONT color=blue>Produce</FONT></B> can also emphasize visible or actual results, but can apply to intentional or unintentional as well as to both good or bad results: a plan that <I><FONT color=brown>produced</FONT></I> concrete improvements in its first year of operation; proposals that <I><FONT color=brown>produced</FONT></I> fiery outbursts on the floor of the House. At its most literal, the word can apply to the bearing of fruit or the creation of something: countries that <I><FONT color=brown>produced</FONT></I> bumper crops while the famine raged; factories that <I><FONT color=brown>produce</FONT></I> war materials. At its most neutral, the word merely assigns actions or results to the factors or agents that brought them about: Penicillin can <I><FONT color=brown>produce</FONT></I> an extreme allergic reaction in some people.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cause</FONT></B> is most closely related to this last sense of produce, stressing the relationship between a result and the factors responsible for it. [A stroke can <I><FONT color=brown>cause</FONT></I> permanent paralysis; Continual conflict among city-states caused the eventual decline of Greek civilization.] On this neutral level, the word points to the dispassionate or scientific tracing of a train of causality, often from the philosophical viewpoint of determinism. More <I><FONT color=brown>cause</FONT></I> their children to grow up warped and apathetic. But a stress on inadvertence rather than on blame can be the point of the word in this use: He had unwittingly <I><FONT color=brown>caused</FONT></I> the accident by misreading a road sign.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Decide">DECIDE</A>, <A href="entry://Perform">PERFORM</A>, <A href="entry://Reach">REACH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, deter, <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, <A href="entry://Prevent">PREVENT</A>, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A>.</P>

<P>These words pertain to the physical or mental application that is devoted to achieving a result. At its mildest, <B><FONT color=blue>effort</FONT></B> can be used in reference to measuring the amount of application a given task requires. [How much <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> will it take to get the orders out on time? It takes only a little <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> to keep your shoes polished.] With a slight increase in force, it can stress a more than ordinary attentiveness or thoughtfulness: students who make an <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> to note their own spelling errors; She decided to make a special <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> to please him. When the word points specifically to a great outlay of energy, a challenging, difficult or unpleasant task is implied: a real <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> to win the race; a crisis that will require all our will and <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> to survive; What an <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> it took to endure the blabbering old busybody without insulting her.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Exertion</FONT></B> more readily suggests a considerable or exhausting outlay of <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I>: He stood gasping with <I><FONT color=brown>exertion</FONT></I> after reaching the summit of the hill; the mental <I><FONT color=brown>exertion</FONT></I> it took to make the accounts balance. Unqualified, the word is more likely to apply to physical <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I>, but not always: Students with low entry qualifications are expected to show greater <I><FONT color=brown>exertion</FONT></I> in their studies. <B><FONT color=blue>Pains</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>trouble</FONT></B> would also seem to stress outlay of <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> in the face of difficulty or resistance, but both words are used idiomatically to indicate, instead, thoughtfulness or carefulness without necessarily suggesting great <I><FONT color=brown>exertion</FONT></I>. [She took whatever <I><FONT color=brown>pains</FONT></I> necessary to put her guests at ease; He’d be a good worker if he’d only take the <I><FONT color=brown>trouble</FONT></I> to get to work on time.] <I><FONT color=brown>Trouble</FONT></I> in particular can be used ironically to suggest a small <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I>, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>pains</FONT></I> can as easily be used for exacting <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I>: taking great <I><FONT color=brown>pains</FONT></I> with every detail of the programme.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Struggle</FONT></B> is the one word here that almost exclusively points to extreme <I><FONT color=brown>efforts</FONT></I>, those called up not only by the difficulty of the task or the external resistance to its achievement but by the determination, will or zeal of the actor as well: his heroic struggle to overcome all obstacles in a situation where it would have been an <I><FONT color=brown>effort</FONT></I> merely to stay alive. When qualified, however, the word need not always be so positive or approving: a feeble <I><FONT color=brown>struggle</FONT></I> to extricate himself; a hopeless <I><FONT color=brown>struggle</FONT></I> to escape his just punishment.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Labour">LABOUR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: ease, facility, rest, <A href="entry://Sloth">SLOTH</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to aggressive rudeness born of crude vulgarity or unashamed egotism. <B><FONT color=blue>Effrontery</FONT></B> indicates an insult to good manners by someone who is pushy or conceited: the <I><FONT color=brown>effrontery</FONT></I> to ask to woman how she felt when she first got word of the accident; the <I><FONT color=brown>effrontery</FONT></I> to ask the distinguished guests if they had read his book. As in these examples, the word often suggests offensive behaviour that comes as a shock or surprise, but this is not always the case: I knew what he wanted and was only waiting to see if he would have the <I><FONT color=brown>effrontery</FONT></I> to put it into words. <B><FONT color=blue>Impertinence</FONT></B> is a shade milder than <I><FONT color=brown>effrontery</FONT></I>, suggesting an offence to good manners that results from action that is out of place of from an uncalled-for remark: his <I><FONT color=brown>impertinence</FONT></I> in coming to the party uninvited; her <I><FONT color=brown>impertinence</FONT></I> in asking about details of our private life. As in the last example, the word can sometimes point to a prying busybody who meddles in the affairs of others. In this case the stress is on aggressiveness rather than on arrogance. At its mildest the word can point to a mere lack of relevance: It is an <I><FONT color=brown>impertinence</FONT></I> in scholarly work to insist on assigning blame rather than analyzing actual conditions in an objective way. Usually, however, the word does suggest impropriety or a lack of breeding.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Churlishness</FONT></B> emphasizes this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>impertinence</FONT></I>, concentrating on grossly ill-mannered behaviour that is the result of a crude, coarse or vulgar background. This use reflects the word’s derivation from a root referring to a low-born man or one of the lowest rank. In addition, <I><FONT color=brown>churlishness</FONT></I> is the most extreme and disapproving of these words, implying an accompanying manner that is surly, contentious, hostile and drastically inconsiderate: Both his constant quarrels with the neighbours and his chronic mistreatment of his children attested amply to his inescapable <I><FONT color=brown>churlishness</FONT></I>. Ill breeding may sometimes be absent as an implication: the brazen <I><FONT color=brown>churlishness</FONT></I> of the woman in the complaints department. <B><FONT color=blue>Impudence</FONT></B> relates more closely to <I><FONT color=brown>effrontery</FONT></I>, pointing to aggressive behaviour that is not restrained by considerations of taste or courtesy. The word’s special stress, however, is on a contemptuous or obnoxious arrogance: the <I><FONT color=brown>impudence</FONT></I> to suggest that his private-school background made him better qualified for the job than applicants from the state school. As can be seen, <I><FONT color=brown>impudence</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>churlishness</FONT></I> contrast strongly in that <I><FONT color=brown>churlishness</FONT></I> can indicate a low or coarse background whereas <I><FONT color=brown>impudence</FONT></I> can indicate a supposedly superior background. <I><FONT color=brown>Impudence</FONT></I> contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>effrontery</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>impertinence</FONT></I> in that this pair often points to specific acts; furthermore, these acts could conceivably be inadvertent. <I><FONT color=brown>Impudence</FONT></I>, however, points to an insufferable manner that is reflected in deliberate insolence: an <I><FONT color=brown>impertinence</FONT></I> that resulted mostly from sheer ignorance rather than from outright <I><FONT color=brown>impudence</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Brashness">BRASHNESS</A>, <A href="entry://Contemptuous">CONTEMPTUOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Overbearing">OVERBEARING</A>, <A href="entry://None">RUDE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: civility, courtesy, kindness, meekness, politeness, timidity.</P>

<P>These words refer to a preoccupation and concern only for oneself. <B><FONT color=blue>Egoism</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>egotism</FONT></B> are a related pair with a fine distinction in meaning. <I><FONT color=brown>Egotism</FONT></I> is disapproving in tone, suggesting someone with an inflated or unrealistic view of his own worth because of extreme self-preoccupation: the typical <I><FONT color=brown>egotism</FONT></I> of those who think the world owes them a living. <I><FONT color=brown>Egoism</FONT></I>, on the other hand, is a more ambiguous term. It might apply to someone who does not necessarily consider himself superior but who nevertheless remains preoccupied exclusively with himself: the <I><FONT color=brown>egoism</FONT></I> of the young office executive seeking advancement. The word has been given a new slant of meaning, furthermore, by psychological theorists of the last half-century. Theories that stress the importance of a strong ego (or "positive self-concept") as a key to mental stability have made it possible for <I><FONT color=brown>egoism</FONT></I> to suggest healthy self-interest coupled with a solid sense of identity: the <I><FONT color=brown>egoism</FONT></I> normal to a small infant; activities that will develop a healthy <I><FONT color=brown>egoism</FONT></I> in young adolescents.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conceit</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vanity</FONT></B> stress the sense of inflated worth that is involved in <I><FONT color=brown>egotism</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Conceit</FONT></I> suggests a general state of being puffed-up about one’s own imagined superiority to others, so extreme as to rule out any self-assessment or self-criticism whatsoever: a fathomless <I><FONT color=brown>conceit</FONT></I> that prevents him from working hard enough to perfect his real but unformed talents. <I><FONT color=brown>Vanity</FONT></I> suggests self-pride that is based not so much on a feeling of superiority to others as on an unrealistic admiration and love for oneself: the actress who requires constant obeisance and flattery to satisfy her <I><FONT color=brown>vanity</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Conceit</FONT></I> no longer sounds as extremely informal as it once may have, but <I><FONT color=brown>vanity</FONT></I> is still the slightly more formal of the two words. <B><FONT color=blue>Self-importance</FONT></B> is closely related to conceit and vanity but is more neutral and descriptive: diplomats who bustled about in a display of their own <I><FONT color=brown>self-importance</FONT></I>. Sometimes, the word can suggest considerations of status or involvement in serious or worthwhile affairs rather than a strictly personal conceit. [She spends hours before her mirror feeding her vanity, but is that nay worse than your tedious concern with office protocol simply as a way of ensuring your own <I><FONT color=brown>self-importance</FONT></I>?]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Narcissism</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>solipsism</FONT></B> may once have been technical terms drawn respectively from psychology and philosophy, but they are now gaining a wider currency for the cluster of meanings discussed here. <I><FONT color=brown>Narcissism</FONT></I> in a strict psychological sense refers to an extreme withdrawal into self-preoccupation and self-love. It has come to be used more loosely to substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>egotism</FONT></I>: the star system in the theatre that is responsible for a most pernicious form of <I><FONT color=brown>narcissism</FONT></I> among actors. <I><FONT color=brown>Solipsism</FONT></I> in a strict philosophical context refers to a disbelief in the existence of anything beyond the self; it now extends pejoratively to anyone completely wrapped up in a private world of his own: the <I><FONT color=brown>solipsism</FONT></I> of those avant-garde writers who do not even attempt to communicate with their audiences.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Selfishness</FONT></B> need not suggest an inflated sense of worth at all or even extreme self-preoccupation. Its main connotation is that of grasping greediness without concern for others: the <I><FONT color=brown>selfishness</FONT></I> of those lobbyists who press for legislation beneficial to special interests but harmful to the general public. Under certain circumstances, however, it need not be wholly pejorative; in this it may approach come uses of egoism: the natural <I><FONT color=brown>selfishness</FONT></I> of the three-year-old.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boast">BOAST</A>, <A href="entry://Brashness">BRASHNESS</A>, <A href="entry://Confidence">CONFIDENCE</A>, <A href="entry://Overbearing">OVERBEARING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: altruism, humility, meekness, modesty, shyness.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>elegant</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>de luxe</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>elaborate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>grandiose</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>luxurious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ornate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sumptuous</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to what is highly fashionable or formal in style and is costly, detailed or lavish, as well. <B><FONT color=blue>Elegant</FONT></B> is the most general but least concrete of these, being an approving word that refers to what is striking for its taste and value: a set of books with <I><FONT color=brown>elegant</FONT></I> bindings. It may suggest rarity as well as refinement, but may or may not suggest a piling up of great or costly masses of detail: the heavy gold scrolls of the <I><FONT color=brown>elegant</FONT></I> picture frame; a room <I><FONT color=brown>elegant</FONT></I> in its bareness, being sparsely furnished with a few pieces of modern furniture.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Elaborate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ornate</FONT></B> both specifically indicate great detailing, but neither necessarily carries the built-in approving tone of elegant. <I><FONT color=brown>Elaborate</FONT></I> indicates a full-scale working out of something with painstaking care and thought: an <I><FONT color=brown>elaborate</FONT></I> epic poem with an amazing amount of themes and interrelated strands of imagery; <I><FONT color=brown>elaborate</FONT></I> costume balls that bored him silly; an <I><FONT color=brown>elaborate</FONT></I> hoax. The word can also apply to argument or reasoning that is methodical, lengthy and abstruse: an <I><FONT color=brown>elaborate</FONT></I> hypothesis. <I><FONT color=brown>Ornate</FONT></I> is more restricted to decoration, suggesting a denseness that is not so much orderly as sensual: <I><FONT color=brown>ornate</FONT></I> verbal imagery. The word stresses the finished effect more than the care of work that went into it. Sometimes richness or costliness of the result is implied: an <I><FONT color=brown>ornate</FONT></I> piece of jewellery studded with several different kinds of precious stones.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Luxurious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sumptuous</FONT></B> specifically stress the sparing of no expense to create something fashionably lavish. These words may or may not point to the tastefulness suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>elegant</FONT></I> or the amassing of detail emphasized by the previous pair but they do point to a showiness of general effect. <I><FONT color=brown>Luxurious</FONT></I> often suggests, as well, a setting arranged for comfort and convenience: the <I><FONT color=brown>luxurious</FONT></I> hotel; a <I><FONT color=brown>luxurious</FONT></I> car complete with air conditioning, telephone and bar. The word need not be approving; a <I><FONT color=brown>luxurious</FONT></I> airport that was in the most garish and banal taste possible. Often, however, the word is applied approvingly to things in nature, eliminating any notion of costliness but emphasizing denseness, beauty or richness, as of visual effect: the <I><FONT color=brown>luxurious</FONT></I> plumage of the peacock; a <I><FONT color=brown>luxurious</FONT></I> forest floor of interlaced pine needles. <I><FONT color=brown>Sumptuous</FONT></I> is more likely to be restricted to man-made things; its root refers to expenditure and this emphasis on costliness is frequently present in the word’s use: a <I><FONT color=brown>sumptuous</FONT></I> Gbelin tapestry; critics who judged the <I><FONT color=brown>sumptuous</FONT></I> new opera house to be a aesthetic disaster. In its most common use, food is usually the subject: A delightful cognac rounded off this most <I><FONT color=brown>sumptuous</FONT></I> meal. Used more loosely, the word may indicate something well turned out, tasteful or lavish, without necessarily implying expenditure: the only woman on the beach with a really <I><FONT color=brown>sumptuous</FONT></I> figure.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>De luxe</FONT></B> comes from the French phrase that means of luxury. Thus it might function identically with <I><FONT color=brown>luxurious</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>De luxe</FONT></I>, however, very often refers to special accommodation: a <I><FONT color=brown>de luxe</FONT></I> compartment on the train: a <I><FONT color=brown>de luxe</FONT></I> hotel suite. In these and other cases, it can refer to added benefits, comforts or value that costs more than the ordinary version: a <I><FONT color=brown>de luxe</FONT></I> leather-bound edition of the encyclopaedia. Since the word has become chiefly a merchandising term, it is often used to be deliberately deceptive: proof that the tinned mushrooms labelled <I><FONT color=brown>de luxe</FONT></I> were not significantly different in quality from the regular grade.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Grandiose</FONT></B> is the one word here that specifically and exclusively stresses a pretentious, inflated or pompous striving for the elegant or <I><FONT color=brown>sumptuous</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>grandiose</FONT></I> speech filled with empty rhetoric. In this sense, it has a wider, more general range of applications than other words here: a <I><FONT color=brown>grandiose</FONT></I> symphony that ran on for more than two hours; the <I><FONT color=brown>grandiose</FONT></I> delusions of some schizophrenics.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Excellent">EXCELLENT</A>, <A href="entry://Exquisite">EXQUISITE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: inexpensive, <A href="entry://Mediocre">MEDIOCRE</A>, plain, simple, unadorned, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>, <A href="entry://Vulgar">VULGAR</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>high</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>elevated</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lofty</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>tall</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>towering</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to something of a relatively sizeable vertical dimension or to something found or placed at considerable altitude. <B><FONT color=blue>High</FONT></B> functions in both these ways: <I><FONT color=brown>high</FONT></I> buildings; a little shack <I><FONT color=brown>high</FONT></I> up in the hills. <B><FONT color=blue>Tall</FONT></B>, by contrast, is restricted to the first situation: a <I><FONT color=brown>tall</FONT></I> man; a child <I><FONT color=brown>tall</FONT></I> for her age. Because of this, <I><FONT color=brown>tall</FONT></I> is preferred over <I><FONT color=brown>high</FONT></I> in more formal contexts to indicate vertical height: <I><FONT color=brown>tall</FONT></I> buildings. But the informal use of <I><FONT color=brown>high</FONT></I> in this sense remains secure: climb the <I><FONT color=brown>highest</FONT></I> mountain. <I><FONT color=brown>High</FONT></I>, in general, does tend to suggest altitude, <I><FONT color=brown>tall</FONT></I> relative dimension. <I><FONT color=brown>High</FONT></I>, furthermore, is used metaphorically to refer to mobility or intensity: <I><FONT color=brown>high</FONT></I> moral purpose; <I><FONT color=brown>high</FONT></I> spirits. <I><FONT color=brown>Tall</FONT></I> has fewer metaphorical uses, one of them being in reference to masculinity: <I><FONT color=brown>tall</FONT></I> in the saddle.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Elevated</FONT></I>, considerably more formal than the foregoing, is like <I><FONT color=brown>high</FONT></I> in referring both to vertical dimension and placement at an altitude: an office building <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I> a dozen floors above its neighbours; an <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I> railway. The word has a special use to indicate anything that has been raised above something else: an <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I> walkway for pedestrians; the <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I> tiers of the rock garden that ran halfway up the slope. Metaphorically, the word emphasizes nobility, dignity or profundity: an <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I> discussion of final causes. But the word can suggest pretentious pomposity or inflated self-esteem: considering herself too <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I> to eat with the common horde in the dining room; <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I> diction.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Towering</FONT></B>, by contrast, is restricted like <I><FONT color=brown>tall</FONT></I>, to refer to things of a considerable height, although it is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>tall</FONT></I>, almost to the point of hyperbole: the <I><FONT color=brown>towering</FONT></I> giant of a man who was walking towards us; the <I><FONT color=brown>towering</FONT></I> karri trees of Western Australia; <I><FONT color=brown>towering</FONT></I> skyscrapers. Metaphorically, the word is vaguer than high or <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I>, making a hyperbolic plea that something be regarded as greatly important or valuable: our <I><FONT color=brown>towering</FONT></I> need for solutions to present-day problems: a <I><FONT color=brown>towering</FONT></I> figure in world literature.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lofty</FONT></B> may refer, like high, either to stature or placement at an altitude: the <I><FONT color=brown>lofty</FONT></I> oak; the <I><FONT color=brown>lofty</FONT></I> mountain pass. Both these concrete uses may seem less than natural now, however, having a ring that would sound too pretentious in many situations. The word, like elevated, once was used metaphorically to indicate nobility and profundity, but this use, too, could be thought dangerously affected: the <I><FONT color=brown>lofty</FONT></I> efforts of our city fathers. The word does have a specific use to suggest a sense of superiority that causes someone to withdraw and act in a cold or remote manner; the word is, in this case, disapproving or pejorative in tone: the <I><FONT color=brown>lofty</FONT></I> arrogance of the white planters; a <I><FONT color=brown>lofty</FONT></I> indifference of some writers to the pressing problems of their times.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Outstanding">OUTSTANDING</A>, <A href="entry://Position">POSITION</A>, <A href="entry://Steep">STEEP</A>, <A href="entry://Summit">SUMMIT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: base, degraded, low, short.</P>

<P>These words refer to subjective or affective states of mind rather than to objective or rational attitudes. <B><FONT color=blue>Emotion</FONT></B> is the most general and neutral, including all states of mind from the slightest change in mood to the most intense or violent seizures: a wistful <I><FONT color=brown>emotion</FONT></I> that briefly clouded her eyes; a struggle within him of <I><FONT color=brown>emotions</FONT></I> so intense he would hardly speak. <B><FONT color=blue>Feeling</FONT></B> is similar to but more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>emotion</FONT></I>. It too can refer both to weak or intense states: a faint <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I> of disgust at his proposition; Violent <I><FONT color=brown>feelings</FONT></I> broke out into full, ungovernable expression. <I><FONT color=brown>Feeling</FONT></I>, however, has a specific use to refer to a state of intense receptivity or expressivity: jurors who listened to her story with evident <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I>; trying to play the piano piece with more <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I>. While <I><FONT color=brown>emotion</FONT></I> might occasionally be used in this way, it sounds less natural in such a context than <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Passion</FONT></B> may once have been used in a fairly neutral way to describe strong <I><FONT color=brown>emotions</FONT></I> of all varieties; now, however, it is more strictly limited to sexual feeling or obsessive emotions: a <I><FONT color=brown>passion</FONT></I> for his wife undimmed by the years; an absolute <I><FONT color=brown>passion</FONT></I> for seeking out the untravelled byways of a country. In the sense of obsessive preoccupation, the word has so frequently been used hyperbolically that its force has been somewhat dulled and made trivial: a <I><FONT color=brown>passion</FONT></I> for garlic pickles. In its sense of sexual <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I>, it can seem antiquated or euphemistic: an unholy <I><FONT color=brown>passion</FONT></I> for the fair sex. <B><FONT color=blue>Desire</FONT></B> is now the preferred word for suggesting sexual <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I>, but it can also refer to any feeling of wanting or needing something: a <I><FONT color=brown>desire</FONT></I> for the opposite sex that is first expressed by hair-pulling and practical jokes; a strong <I><FONT color=brown>desire</FONT></I> to see his native country once more before he died. In contexts where <I><FONT color=brown>passion</FONT></I> escapes the charge of fustiness, it would suggest a greater potential for action than <I><FONT color=brown>desire</FONT></I>. [He was aware of the <I><FONT color=brown>desire</FONT></I> that had led him to call on her again, but he was surprised at the overwhelming <I><FONT color=brown>passion</FONT></I> he felt at seeing her face smiling up at his.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sentiment</FONT></B> may specifically suggest a fixed attitude that is an abiding part of one’s personality and that can be called up afresh as feeling by some external catalyst: politicians appealing to <I><FONT color=brown>sentiments</FONT></I> as safe as love of God, home and mother. In a more general use, it can, like <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I>, suggest any of a variety of strong <I><FONT color=brown>emotions</FONT></I>. It also has a special use, referring to the expression of an emotional stand: He expressed his <I><FONT color=brown>sentiments</FONT></I> about the war with great eloquence. <B><FONT color=blue>Affect</FONT></B> is the most formal and technical of all these words and has little everyday use; it is used in psychiatric parlance to refer to an emotional state in its discernible psychological rather than physiological aspect. [The excessive <I><FONT color=brown>affect</FONT></I> with which she reacted to several of the inkblots was also reflected in changes in her pulse and respiration; He was still in a state of shock and thus able to speak of his recent ordeal without <I><FONT color=brown>affect</FONT></I>; the typical catatonic’s total loss of <I><FONT color=brown>affect</FONT></I>.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Attraction">ATTRACTION</A>, <A href="entry://Imagination">IMAGINATION</A>, <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>, <A href="entry://Preoccupied">PREOCCUPIED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: indifference, insensibility, rationality, reason.</P>

<P>These words refer to an unwelcome advance, usually upon someone else’s territory or privacy. <B><FONT color=blue>Encroach</FONT></B> emphasizes the slowness or subtlety of an advance that may at first have proceeded without a countering complaint only to be recognized finally as a threat: powers of the executive branch that have gradually <I><FONT color=brown>encroached</FONT></I> on the rights of the other branches; a mother-in-law whose attentions are not meant to <I><FONT color=brown>encroach</FONT></I> on the privacy of the newly married couple; urban sprawl that <I><FONT color=brown>encroaches</FONT></I> on unspoilt countryside.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intrude</FONT></B> is more often limited to overstepping of personal privacy than to territorial expansion. It suggests a situation in which a person or group has deliberately withdrawn in order to escape interruption ?but without success: parents who <I><FONT color=brown>intrude</FONT></I> on the secrecies of childhood. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>encroach</FONT></I>, however, <I><FONT color=brown>intrude</FONT></I> may more often be unintentional or sudden: embarrassed at finding that he had <I><FONT color=brown>intruded</FONT></I> on the young lovers. It can sometimes be used more generally, but the note of a personal situation is still retained: newspapers that attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>intrude</FONT></I> on the decision-making process.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Invade</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>violate</FONT></B> are much harsher terms; they would never suggest unintentional acts, like <I><FONT color=brown>intrude</FONT></I>, nor gradual acts, like <I><FONT color=brown>encroach</FONT></I>. They may, in fact, suggest savagery and violence. <I><FONT color=brown>Invade</FONT></I> most readily brings to mind a military attack by one nation on another: the day Hitler <I><FONT color=brown>invaded</FONT></I> Poland. In other uses this context of military conquest is usually present as a negative connotation: forests <I><FONT color=brown>invaded</FONT></I> by timber speculators. <I><FONT color=brown>Violate</FONT></I> has both a sexual and a legal context: a woman <I><FONT color=brown>violated</FONT></I> by her attacker; a court ruling that basic constitutional rights had been <I><FONT color=brown>violated</FONT></I>. In more general uses, it can express outage at unethical tactics: discrimination that <I><FONT color=brown>violates</FONT></I> the very ideals most citizens hold sacred.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Infringe</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>trespass</FONT></B> are mainly restricted to a legal context and are consequently less intensely negative in tone than <I><FONT color=brown>invade</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>violate</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Infringe</FONT></I> most appropriately refers to the violation of a principle or a legal right, while <I><FONT color=brown>trespass</FONT></I> most appropriately refers to the illegal use of or encroachment on someone else’s property: laws that <I><FONT color=brown>infringe</FONT></I> on free speech; <I><FONT color=brown>infringing</FONT></I> on a copyright; shooters who <I><FONT color=brown>trespass</FONT></I> on a farmer’s land. <I><FONT color=brown>Infringe</FONT></I>, thus, compares with <I><FONT color=brown>intrude</FONT></I>, but does not have the personal tone of the latter. <I><FONT color=brown>Trespass</FONT></I>, similarly, compares with <I><FONT color=brown>invade</FONT></I>, but need not imply a concerted attack. Both <I><FONT color=brown>infringe</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>trespass</FONT></I>, of course, have wider applications, although they carry with them connotations from these most specific uses.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Insert">INSERT</A>, <A href="entry://Meddlesome">MEDDLESOME</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: desist, observe, respect, withdraw.</P>

<P>These words are alike in suggesting favourable judgement or support given someone or something. <B><FONT color=blue>Endorse</FONT></B> means literally to write on the back of: to <I><FONT color=brown>endorse</FONT></I> a cheque. In its figurative sense, <I><FONT color=brown>endorse</FONT></I> means to give approval and support to. [At its last meeting, Council <I><FONT color=brown>endorsed</FONT></I> changes intended to modernize the building code; a TV commercial in which a well-known sportsman <I><FONT color=brown>endorses</FONT></I> a hair cream; to <I><FONT color=brown>endorse</FONT></I> a political candidate.]</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>accredit</FONT></B> is to furnish someone with credentials or to invest with authority. <I><FONT color=brown>Accredit</FONT></I> suggests either formal acceptance of or the meeting of official standards: to <I><FONT color=brown>accredit</FONT></I> an ambassador; a school <I><FONT color=brown>accredited</FONT></I> by the Department of Education.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Approve</FONT></B> is the most general term in this group of words, and may indicate anything from mild acquiescence to enthusiastic support; moreover, it may refer to official endorsement or to a wholly personal reaction: to <I><FONT color=brown>approve</FONT></I> a subordinate’s expense account; to <I><FONT color=brown>approve</FONT></I> one’s daughter’s marriage. [The board <I><FONT color=brown>approved</FONT></I> unanimously the appointment of a public-relations officer; He had no choice but to <I><FONT color=brown>approve</FONT></I> the application for membership.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Confirm</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sanction</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ratify</FONT></B> share with <I><FONT color=brown>endorse</FONT></I> the meaning of making legal or effective by approving. To <I><FONT color=brown>sanction</FONT></I>, the strongest of these terms, is to <I><FONT color=brown>approve</FONT></I> authoritatively or to make valid. Like <I><FONT color=brown>endorse</FONT></I>, it couples support with approval: a church that refused to <I><FONT color=brown>sanction</FONT></I> racial discrimination; Public opinion <I><FONT color=brown>sanctioned</FONT></I> a more liberal view on divorce. <I><FONT color=brown>Ratify</FONT></I> always suggests formal approval in an official and authoritative setting. [Australia <I><FONT color=brown>ratified</FONT></I> the Treaty of Peace with Japan on 10<SUP>th</SUP> April, 1952; New Zealand on 29<SUP>th</SUP> April, 1952.] <I><FONT color=brown>Confirm</FONT></I> is not as strong as either ratify or <I><FONT color=brown>sanction</FONT></I>, though it is sometimes used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>ratify</FONT></I>. To <I><FONT color=brown>confirm</FONT></I> is to make valid or binding by approval or acceptance: Council was asked to <I><FONT color=brown>confirm</FONT></I> the engineer’s estimates for the coming year. A government arbitrator who <I><FONT color=brown>confirmed</FONT></I> an agreement reached between labour and management.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>O.K.</FONT></B> is an informal term that often implies a written expression of approval, as a signature or initials: The editor <I><FONT color=brown>O.K.‘d</FONT></I> the manuscript for publication; a bank official who <I><FONT color=brown>O.K.’d</FONT></I> a shipment of gold bars.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: censure, condemn, disapprove, discredit, <A href="entry://Reject">REJECT</A>, reprehend, <A href="entry://Void">VOID</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable when they mean to make something larger or greater. <B><FONT color=blue>Enlarge</FONT></B> points to size or dimension: to <I><FONT color=brown>enlarge</FONT></I> a photograph; to <I><FONT color=brown>enlarge</FONT></I> a house by adding a new wing; to <I><FONT color=brown>enlarge</FONT></I> a staff by engaging six new people. <B><FONT color=blue>Increase</FONT></B> may point to quantity or intensity as well as size: to <I><FONT color=brown>increase</FONT></I> one’s stock of food during wartime.

Or to step up or accelerate: to <I><FONT color=brown>increase</FONT></I> the rate of productivity.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Expand</FONT></B> may mean to increase in range, scope or volume as well as in size: to <I><FONT color=brown>expand</FONT></I> the economy by introducing government spending on a broad scale. <I><FONT color=brown>Expand</FONT></I> conveys the idea of a general <I><FONT color=brown>enlarging</FONT></I> in all dimensions rather than one, and suggests an unfolding or opening out: to <I><FONT color=brown>expand</FONT></I> one’s operation to include all aspects of the clothing business. <I><FONT color=brown>Expand</FONT></I> also can refer to the filling in or development of details: to <I><FONT color=brown>expand</FONT></I> a speech; to <I><FONT color=brown>expand</FONT></I> an equation. <B><FONT color=blue>Amplify</FONT></B> can also refer to the filling in of details, but stresses the addition of material for the sake of completeness, as by illustration. [The Minister was asked to <I><FONT color=brown>amplify</FONT></I> his statement that our goal was nothing less than total victory; to <I><FONT color=brown>amplify</FONT></I> a comment by providing reporters with back ground information.] As the contexts of these illustrations indicate, <I><FONT color=brown>amplify</FONT></I> is most often used of formal situations. In its more basic sense, <I><FONT color=brown>amplify</FONT></I> is nowadays used almost exclusively to refer to the <I><FONT color=brown>increase</FONT></I> in the strength of sound or of the electromagnetic waves that produce it: to <I><FONT color=brown>amplify</FONT></I> sound with the use of electronic equipment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Augment</FONT></B> means to add to, and is in some contexts interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>increase</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>enlarge</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>augment</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>increase</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>enlarge</FONT></I>) a sales force. <I><FONT color=brown>Augment</FONT></I>, however, emphasizes the action of addition more than the increase in size, and often suggests that the addition is temporary expedient rather than a permanent or structural <I><FONT color=brown>increase</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>augment</FONT></I> a besieged infantry regiment with fresh troops. <I><FONT color=brown>Augment</FONT></I> may refer to intensity as well as amount: to <I><FONT color=brown>augment</FONT></I> an electrical signal by increasing the power, thus <I><FONT color=brown>amplifying</FONT></I> the sound.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Magnify</FONT></B> means to make something larger or greater either in fact or in appearance: A microscope <I><FONT color=brown>magnifies</FONT></I> objects by making them appear larger even though it does not <I><FONT color=brown>increase</FONT></I> their actual sizes. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>magnify</FONT></I> implies exaggeration ?that is, making something appear to be larger or more important than it really is: to <I><FONT color=brown>magnify</FONT></I> a relatively trivial loss.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Escalate">ESCALATE</A>, <A href="entry://Extend">EXTEND</A>, <A href="entry://Swell">SWELL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: condense, contract, decrease, narrow, <A href="entry://Reduce">REDUCE</A>, <A href="entry://Shorten">SHORTEN</A>.</P>

<P>These words are alike in denoting feelings of ill will or active dislike. <B><FONT color=blue>Enmity</FONT></B> is the quality or feeling that characterizes an enemy; it may be personal or impersonal, overt or hidden, but it is usually the result of a long-standing argument or of a prolonged series of conflicts, and hence is profoundly felt and not easily eradicated: The <I><FONT color=brown>enmity</FONT></I> between Arabs and Israelis threatened to break into open war at any time. <B><FONT color=blue>Hostility</FONT></B> embraces the actions by which <I><FONT color=brown>enmity</FONT></I> is displayed; it is often used in the plural: The <I><FONT color=brown>hostilities</FONT></I> were marked by brief periods of savage fighting. <I><FONT color=brown>Hostility</FONT></I> also refers to the state of being hostile, i.e., of feeling unfriendly or ill-disposed towards often to the point of menace: The <I><FONT color=brown>hostility</FONT></I> between the pro-war demonstrators and anti-war picketers was marked by several scuffles; the <I><FONT color=brown>hostility</FONT></I> with which the middle-class mothers in the park regarded the group of guitar-playing hippies.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hatred</FONT></B> is an intense dislike coupled with a strong desire to harm the object of one’s feeling. <I><FONT color=brown>Hatred</FONT></I> is deep-seated and malicious, and may be the end result of <I><FONT color=brown>enmity</FONT></I> or of prolonged <I><FONT color=brown>hostility</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>hatred</FONT></I> felt for the Nazis by concentration-camp survivors; Discrimination and persecution have created an atmosphere of <I><FONT color=brown>hatred</FONT></I> between Negro and white in some parts of America. <I><FONT color=brown>Hatred</FONT></I>, however, can also be applied to things and conditions, and may depend on instinct or temperamental aversion: a cat's <I><FONT color=brown>hatred</FONT></I> of water.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Antagonism</FONT></B> emphasizes mutuality of ill will between persons or groups, and often implies temperamental incompatibility. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>hostility</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>antagonism</FONT></I> seldom implies that harmful actions will result: Actors sometimes resent too specific guidance from their directors, and a feeling of <I><FONT color=brown>antagonism</FONT></I> may spring up between them. <B><FONT color=blue>Animus</FONT></B> implies a feeling of ill will or antipathy so deep-rooted and intertwined with character and background that a coherent explanation of its cause is seldom possible: to harbour an <I><FONT color=brown>animus</FONT></I> against boys who wear their hair long; an <I><FONT color=brown>animus</FONT></I> against intellectuals in government.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Animosity</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rancour</FONT></B> are stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>enmity</FONT></I>, but often less enduring; <I><FONT color=brown>animosity</FONT></I> suggests vindictive anger, and <I><FONT color=brown>rancour</FONT></I>, bitter resentment. [He nourished a feeling of <I><FONT color=brown>animosity</FONT></I> for his penny-pinching boss; A sergeant who felt <I><FONT color=brown>rancour</FONT></I> at being passed over for promotion by his commanding officer.] <I><FONT color=brown>Rancour</FONT></I> is intensely bitter <I><FONT color=brown>enmity</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>hatred</FONT></I>, often coupled with malice or even malevolence: <I><FONT color=brown>Rancour</FONT></I> over his party’s humiliating defeat at the polls led him to organize a military coup with the aim of completely destroying the party in power.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Despise">DESPISE</A>, <A href="entry://Dislike">DISLIKE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: amity, camaraderie, fellowship, harmony, <A href="entry://Love">LOVE</A>, sympathy.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>enrage</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>anger</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>incense</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>infuriate</FONT></B>:

<P>These verbs all mean to arouse extreme displeasure, and usually antagonism, in a person or animal. <B><FONT color=blue>Enrage</FONT></B> means to throw into a rage ?in other words, to put someone in such a state of frustration, anger or annoyance that he is beside himself and may react compulsively or violently. <I><FONT color=brown>Enrage</FONT></I> always implies strong provocation: to <I><FONT color=brown>enrage</FONT></I> a wounded bull by taunting him with a cape; he was <I><FONT color=brown>enraged</FONT></I> by the policeman’s rough treatment of his wife.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Anger</FONT></B>, a more general term, may apply to mild as well as severe displeasure: What <I><FONT color=brown>angered</FONT></I> him most was the lack of writing paper in his hotel room. <I><FONT color=brown>Anger</FONT></I> is often used as a participle to describe one’s disposition: a diplomat not easily <I><FONT color=brown>angered</FONT></I> or flustered; He was always capable of being <I><FONT color=brown>angered</FONT></I> by trifles.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Incense</FONT></B> means literally to set on fire, and thus emphasizes the volatility and heat of <I><FONT color=brown>anger</FONT></I>. It need not, however, imply a long-standing or profound feeling, only one of great intensity: The mayor, <I><FONT color=brown>incensed</FONT></I> over the filthy condition of the hallways of the slum building he was inspecting, ordered an immediate investigation. <I><FONT color=brown>Incense</FONT></I> often implies sharp indignation resulting from a slight or incivility: He was <I><FONT color=brown>incensed</FONT></I> by the curt refusal of the headwaiter to seat him at the table of his choice.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Infuriate</FONT></B> is the strongest term of this group, implying a reaction so intense that one virtually loses control of one’s actions. That which <I><FONT color=brown>infuriates</FONT></I> is felt to be unbearably offensive. [While the display of luxury by the French aristocracy of the eighteenth century <I><FONT color=brown>incensed</FONT></I> the poor of Paris; Marie Antoinette’s suggestion that they eat cake when they had no bread positively <I><FONT color=brown>infuriated</FONT></I> them.] <I><FONT color=brown>Infuriate</FONT></I> is often used hyperbolically in less formal contexts to indicate any degree of anger: She was simply <I><FONT color=brown>infuriated</FONT></I> by her husband’s nasty remark about her new dress.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anger">ANGER</A>, <A href="entry://Bother">BOTHER</A>, <A href="entry://Frantic">FRANTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Outrage">OUTRAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Upset">UPSET</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: mollify, pacify, placate, quiet, soothe, tranquillize.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>entertain</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>amuse</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>divert</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>interest</FONT></B>:

<P>These words have to do with activity that draws the attention and makes time pass agreeably. To <B><FONT color=blue>entertain</FONT></B>, either oneself or others, is to provide some occupation that will afford pleasure or relive monotony or boredom. <I><FONT color=brown>Entertainment</FONT></I> may be simple and personal at one extreme, or formal and public at the other, ranging from short-term distraction and private hospitality to large parties and theatrical performances: a child <I><FONT color=brown>entertaining</FONT></I> himself with his building blocks; to <I><FONT color=brown>entertain</FONT></I> out-of-town guests; a comedian and his travelling troupe <I><FONT color=brown>entertaining</FONT></I> servicemen overseas. <I><FONT color=brown>Entertaining</FONT></I> someone implies the putting forth of active effort: Let me <I><FONT color=brown>entertain</FONT></I> you; an <I><FONT color=brown>entertaining</FONT></I> show. <B><FONT color=blue>Amuse</FONT></B>, by contrast, focuses on response: an <I><FONT color=brown>amusing</FONT></I> book; The queen is not <I><FONT color=brown>amused</FONT></I>. To <I><FONT color=brown>amuse</FONT></I> a person is to affect him in such a way that he is put or kept in a pleasant mood. In a non-specific sense, <I><FONT color=brown>amuse</FONT></I> can suggest any form of distraction that emphasizes light <I><FONT color=brown>entertainment</FONT></I>, pointing to something that brings a smile or laugh or that is thought of as fun. A person may be <I><FONT color=brown>amused</FONT></I> by a clever thought of his own, a bizarre sight, a game, a story, an evening’s entertainment. But a performance of a Greek tragedy, which can entertain an audience by holding their attention and affording them aesthetic satisfaction, would not be said to <I><FONT color=brown>amuse</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Divert</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>amuse</FONT></I> but stresses the fact that the amusement is not constant but is a temporary form of escapism. To <I><FONT color=brown>divert</FONT></I> is to draw the mind away from serious thoughts or pursuits, distracting the attention from work, worry, pain or commonplace concerns and focusing it on pleasure: a <I><FONT color=brown>diverting</FONT></I> comedy. [An evening out may <I><FONT color=brown>divert</FONT></I> an over-worked housewife; The student set aside one night a week for <I><FONT color=brown>diversion</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Interest</FONT></B> is the most general of these words. To <I><FONT color=brown>interest</FONT></I> someone is to excite or hold his curiosity or attention, for whatever reason. [A psychopath <I><FONT color=brown>interest</FONT></I> a psychologist; The student found the lecture <I><FONT color=brown>interesting</FONT></I>.] But the specific sense in which interest compares with the other words in this set involves an awakening of attention by some entertaining expedient: The showing of slides <I><FONT color=brown>interested</FONT></I> the dozing student, and he sat up and took notice.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hobby">HOBBY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: annoy, bore, tire.</P>

<P>These words refer to things of which no part is missing, damaged, omitted, empty or imperfect. <B><FONT color=blue>Entire</FONT></B> may apply both in concrete and in abstract senses, referring to a physical, numerical, temporal or qualitative entity. [The <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> country was affected by drought; The <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> cast was present for dress rehearsal; The <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> day was ruined; His concern as a doctor was for the <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> man, not just for the body.] <B><FONT color=blue>Whole</FONT></B> is more informal and more general than <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> but is very chose to it in meaning and may be substituted for it in the examples above. Both words apply to that which is unbroken or undivided, but sometimes one or the other is used exclusively in a certain context. [When the Venus de Milo was <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>whole</FONT></I>), there were arms on the statue; A <I><FONT color=brown>whole</FONT></I> number is distinguished from a fraction.] <I><FONT color=brown>Whole</FONT></I> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> in suggesting a moral or physical perfection that can be lost and recovered, as by the regaining of health: Your faith has made you <I><FONT color=brown>whole</FONT></I>. Here, <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> is closer to <B><FONT color=blue>intact</FONT></B>, which refers to something that has remained in its original condition. [The second generation kept the family fortune <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I>; The heiress kept her father’s art collection <I><FONT color=brown>intact</FONT></I>.] A thing is said to be <I><FONT color=brown>intact</FONT></I> if it has successfully resisted attempts made on its integrity, or if it has been subjected to destructive influences or forces and has come through unscathed. [She escaped from his clutches with her virtue <I><FONT color=brown>intact</FONT></I>; Few buildings in the bombed city remained <I><FONT color=brown>intact</FONT></I>; Though subjected to brainwashing, the prisoner of war emerged with his integrity <I><FONT color=brown>intact</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Complete</FONT></B> focuses on the presence of all needed or normal parts, while <B><FONT color=blue>total</FONT></B> simply implies a measurable aggregate. Both words may describe a collective entity: a <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I> set of dishes; the <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I> works of Shakespeare; his <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> earnings for 1968. <I><FONT color=brown>Total</FONT></I>, however, involves a precise determination of the size of an existent <I><FONT color=brown>whole</FONT></I>; and whether a <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> amount or number is added to or subtracted from, it still remains a sum <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> so long as it is inclusive and accurate. <I><FONT color=brown>Complete</FONT></I>, by contrast, means finished or perfected, implying the meeting of a standard or fulfilment of a goal. [The <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> number of jurors selected so far is nine, but the jury is not yet <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I>.] In an abstract sense the two words are much more closely synonymous, describing that which covers everything without exception or reservation: <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I>) destruction; a <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I>) commitment. Both are also sometimes interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I>: He has <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I>) control of the business.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Full</FONT></B> stresses content. In its most concrete sense, it implies that a receptacle contains as much as it can hold: to drink a <I><FONT color=brown>full</FONT></I> (or a whole) cup of coffee; a glass full of water. Like <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I>, it may stress the presence of all belonging parts: a <I><FONT color=brown>full</FONT></I> dozen. It may also describe something that is maximum in size, extent, degree or the like: a <I><FONT color=brown>full</FONT></I> moon as opposed to a crescent; a <I><FONT color=brown>full</FONT></I> load; <I><FONT color=brown>full</FONT></I> speed ahead. <I><FONT color=brown>Full</FONT></I> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>whole</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I> in implying that a thing is not deficient or that nothing is being omitted or withheld. To take a <I><FONT color=brown>full</FONT></I> course of study is to take a <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I> course or a <I><FONT color=brown>whole</FONT></I> course. But the other words are stronger and more forceful in referring to something that is absolute and unlimited. [You have my <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> confidence; I have <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>full</FONT></I>) confidence in you.]</P><P>All the words in this set, with the sole exception of intact, may be used as intensives: You’ve missed the <I><FONT color=brown>whole</FONT></I> point; It took us an <I><FONT color=brown>entire</FONT></I> week; a <I><FONT color=brown>full</FONT></I> four years; <I><FONT color=brown>complete</FONT></I> contempt; <I><FONT color=brown>total</FONT></I> abstinence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Finish">FINISH</A>, <A href="entry://Total">TOTAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: broken, damaged, destroyed, divided, imperfect, incomplete, limited, partial.</P>

<P>These words involve the transfer or responsibility to someone else. <B><FONT color=blue>Entrust</FONT></B> stresses safety and reliance. A person may be <I><FONT color=brown>entrusted</FONT></I> with authority or with a specific task: to <I><FONT color=brown>entrust</FONT></I> an agent with power of attorney. A thing <I><FONT color=brown>entrusted</FONT></I> may be a specialized task or an object that needs to be protected: <I><FONT color=brown>entrusting</FONT></I> all jewellery and important documents to a safety-deposit box; <I><FONT color=brown>entrusting</FONT></I> the election campaign to a public-relations firm. <B><FONT color=blue>Confide</FONT></B> gives more intense overtones of safety, caution or discretion: <I><FONT color=brown>confiding</FONT></I> the enforcement of the new regulations to the security officer. In this sense, it is more formal and old fashioned than entrust and has been overshadowed by other meanings of <I><FONT color=brown>confide</FONT></I> not directly related here.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Commit</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>consign</FONT></B> are less personal than entrust and are more formal in this context. At its most general, <I><FONT color=brown>commit</FONT></I> means to place a person or thing in someone else’s charge: <I><FONT color=brown>committing</FONT></I> the child to a nurse’s care. Specifically, it may involve the placing of a person in protective custody: to <I><FONT color=brown>commit</FONT></I> someone to a mental hospital. The word often carries an undertone of giving something up for better or worse to forces beyond one’s control: <I><FONT color=brown>committing</FONT></I> their chances for survival to the prospect of being sighted by a passing ship or plane. <I><FONT color=brown>Consign</FONT></I> suggests great impersonality and has a legalistic or commercial flavour: <I><FONT color=brown>consigning</FONT></I> the spare parts by passenger train. In other cases, the word may suggest criticism for a lack of concern that allows power to fall into the wrong hands: <I><FONT color=brown>consigning</FONT></I> his most basic rights to the hazards of a kangaroo court. Both <I><FONT color=brown>commit</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>consign</FONT></I> may also sometimes focus on the fact of getting rid of a thing for good and all: to <I><FONT color=brown>commit</FONT></I> a paper to the flames; a critic airily <I><FONT color=brown>consigning</FONT></I> an author to oblivion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Delegate</FONT></B> is the most neutral word of this group, implying neither the security and confidence of some, nor the impersonality of others. Its tone is one of mere description without evaluation. It suggests a bureaucratic context in which a leading executive is responsible for work he must nonetheless allow others to execute: the fatal flaw of being unable to <I><FONT color=brown>delegate</FONT></I> authority; <I><FONT color=brown>delegating</FONT></I> all but the most serious matters to a crack team of assistants.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Appoint">APPOINT</A>, <A href="entry://Representative">REPRESENTATIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Trust">TRUST</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>equip</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>furnish</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>outfit</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>supply</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the act of providing things necessary for function or use. <B><FONT color=blue>Equip</FONT></B> may give a technical flavour, but the provisions involved may apply to a person, a device or a place: soldiers <I><FONT color=brown>equipped</FONT></I> with rocket launchers; a car <I><FONT color=brown>equipped</FONT></I> with air conditioning; a radiogram <I><FONT color=brown>equipped</FONT></I> with stereo speakers; a laboratory <I><FONT color=brown>equipped</FONT></I> for atomic research. <B><FONT color=blue>Outfit</FONT></B> suggests the same range of possibilities, but is considerably more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>equip</FONT></I>: a battalion <I><FONT color=brown>outfitted</FONT></I> for tropical warfare; campers <I><FONT color=brown>outfitted</FONT></I> for mountain climbing; a conference room <I><FONT color=brown>outfitted</FONT></I> with tape recorders and sales charts. When applied to people, the word usually suggests wearing apparel, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>equip</FONT></I> might suggest more specialized accessories: holidaymakers <I><FONT color=brown>outfitted</FONT></I> for all kinds of weather and <I><FONT color=brown>equipped</FONT></I> with spear guns and snorkels.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Furnish</FONT></B> applies especially to making rooms livable by the addition of furniture: <I><FONT color=brown>furnishing</FONT></I> the living-room with modern lounges and chairs from Denmark. Although the word most appropriately suggests this general or basic context, it can be used for more specialized circumstances: a space capsule <I><FONT color=brown>furnished</FONT></I> with all the materials necessary for an eight-day flight. It may also, in an abstract sense, mean to provide: activities that <I><FONT color=brown>furnish</FONT></I> an outlet for student opinion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Supply</FONT></B> is much more general than any of those other words.

<P>These words refer to the removal of markings from a surface, possibly so that they can be replaced by other markings. <B><FONT color=blue>Erase</FONT></B> is the least formal and most general of these, referring to symbols removed by any wiping or rubbing action: asking a child to <I><FONT color=brown>erase</FONT></I> the work from the blackboard; <I><FONT color=brown>erasing</FONT></I> the pencilled guidelines after the lettering had been inked in. <B><FONT color=blue>eradicate</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words. Aside from its etymological reference to rooting out, it applies here to the <I><FONT color=brown>erasing</FONT></I> of ink markings by a specially prepared chemical: revisions made in washable ink so that the editor could <I><FONT color=brown>eradicate</FONT></I> them if he chose. <I><FONT color=brown>Eradicate</FONT></I> is widely used in the general sense of completely getting rid of: all fingerprints and all signs of a struggle had been <I><FONT color=brown>eradicated</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cancel</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>delete</FONT></B> are less clear than the foregoing about the means used to cause the removal of markings. <I><FONT color=brown>Cancel</FONT></I> once pointed specifically to the crossing out of something: <I><FONT color=brown>cancelling</FONT></I> every entry that was out of date. By extension, it may mean to rescind or terminate: <I><FONT color=brown>Cancel</FONT></I> my subscription. <I><FONT color=brown>Cancel</FONT></I> also refers to overmarkings on postage stamps or to action that reduces the effectiveness of something: erratic behaviour that <I><FONT color=brown>cancelled</FONT></I> out the good impression he had made previously. <I><FONT color=brown>Delete</FONT></I> still chiefly refers to the editing of a text by removing unwanted expressions; this may be done by crossing out, <I><FONT color=brown>erasing</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>eradicating</FONT></I> or covering the thing to be <I><FONT color=brown>deleted</FONT></I>: using red ink to <I><FONT color=brown>delete</FONT></I> objectionable phrases from the manuscript.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Efface</FONT></B> is also vague about the means of removal, but it may often suggest that markings have become partially or wholly indistinct, not by design but by time and attrition: weathering that had <I><FONT color=brown>effaced</FONT></I> by use. <B><FONT color=blue>Expunge</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>obliterate</FONT></B> refer to forceful and total removal, whether by design or not. <I><FONT color=brown>Expunge</FONT></I> compares to the less formal <I><FONT color=brown>delete</FONT></I>, but may suggest the total removal of a larger body of material by whatever means: <I><FONT color=brown>expunging</FONT></I> from the diaries all reference to people still living, and <I><FONT color=brown>deleting</FONT></I> a few remarks about figures out of the recent past. In any case, <I><FONT color=brown>expunge</FONT></I> suggests an uncompromising removal and the total disappearance of such material. <I><FONT color=brown>Obliterate</FONT></I> suggests even more force than <I><FONT color=brown>expunge</FONT></I>, even to the possible extent of damaging the surface or material on which the markings appear. Otherwise, the word compares with <I><FONT color=brown>efface</FONT></I> in sometimes suggesting indistinctness that results, not by design, but from the action of natural forces: fire damage that had <I><FONT color=brown>obliterated</FONT></I> many passages in the manuscript; erosion that had nearly <I><FONT color=brown>obliterated</FONT></I> all trace of the earliest Minoan settlements.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, <A href="entry://Void">VOID</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: impress, imprint, <A href="entry://Insert">INSERT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a state of being filled with sexual feelings or to things designed to call up such feelings. <B><FONT color=blue>Erotic</FONT></B>, stemming from Eros, the God of Love in Greek mythology, stresses specifically sexual love. The word can refer either to such feelings or to things eliciting these feelings: aware of his own <I><FONT color=brown>erotic</FONT></I> impulses; an <I><FONT color=brown>erotic</FONT></I> film. <B><FONT color=blue>Sensual</FONT></B> can also refer to either situation, but it refers to sexual desire only by implication. Theoretically, it should indicate someone given to a life of the senses or something appealing to the senses, but the word has been used suggestively, perhaps euphemistically, so often that sexual desire in inevitably a part of its reference, although not so strongly insisted upon as in the case of <I><FONT color=brown>erotic</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>sensual</FONT></I> appetite for <I><FONT color=brown>exotic</FONT></I> women; <I><FONT color=brown>sensual</FONT></I> music to which veiled women danced.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Concupiscent</FONT></B> is a learned synonym for lustful, coming from Latin roots meaning to desire intensely. It focuses on fleshly desire that seeks its own gratification, as contrasted with unselfish love, and it carries the implication of original sin: a <I><FONT color=brown>concupiscent</FONT></I> husband, unfaithful to his wife; the <I><FONT color=brown>concupiscent</FONT></I> elements in human character.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Desirous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>amorous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>passionate</FONT></B> refer exclusively to someone filled with erotic feeling. <I><FONT color=brown>Desirous</FONT></I> may suggest a vague longing or lack, without an object in view, or it may suggest a specific sexual wish for a particular object: <I><FONT color=brown>desirous</FONT></I> of a kind of woman he had never met; He became more and more <I><FONT color=brown>desirous</FONT></I> and she seemed more and more desirable the more she rebuffed his advances. In the latter case, <I><FONT color=brown>desirous</FONT></I> suggests a distinction between sexual eagerness and love. <I><FONT color=brown>Amorous</FONT></I> is consequently warmer in feeling, since it can suggest an affectionate desire for lovemaking or sex play: a wife smiling back at her <I><FONT color=brown>amorous</FONT></I> husband. <I><FONT color=brown>Passionate</FONT></I> is more intense than either <I><FONT color=brown>desirous</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>amorous</FONT></I>, but it may or may not be divorced in its intensity from notions of affectionate love: a nymphomaniac making <I><FONT color=brown>passionate</FONT></I> advances to a strange man; proposals of marriage that grew more and more <I><FONT color=brown>passionate</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sexy</FONT></B> is the most informal of all these words. It may be applied to any person or thing that seems to project, radiate or intensify sex appeal: a very <I><FONT color=brown>sexy</FONT></I> girl; a <I><FONT color=brown>sexy</FONT></I> walk; a <I><FONT color=brown>sexy</FONT></I>, form-fitting sweater. Used of books, plays, films and the like, the word points to a titillating preoccupation with sex: a <I><FONT color=brown>sexy</FONT></I> novel. <B><FONT color=blue>Arousing</FONT></B> refers solely to those things that call up sexual desire: a coy manner deliberately designed to be <I><FONT color=brown>arousing</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Emotion">EMOTION</A>, <A href="entry://Hot">HOT</A>, <A href="entry://Lewd">LEWD</A>, <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>, <A href="entry://Stimulate">STIMULATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cold">COLD</A>, sexless.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Artificial</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>imitation</FONT></B> may be applied to anything made by human beings in the form of something natural: <I><FONT color=brown>artificial</FONT></I> flowers; <I><FONT color=brown>imitation</FONT></I> wood-grain. <B><FONT color=blue>Synthetic</FONT></B> is synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>artificial</FONT></I> in this sense, but there is a connotation in <I><FONT color=brown>synthetic</FONT></I> of production by chemical combinations or similar techniques: <I><FONT color=brown>synthetic</FONT></I> rubber. <B><FONT color=blue>False</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ersatz</FONT></B> both suggest a substitute made because of the costliness or lack of the original item: <I><FONT color=brown>false</FONT></I> teeth; the proliferation of <I><FONT color=brown>ersatz</FONT></I> goods during periods of war and inflation. <I><FONT color=brown>False</FONT></I> often implies the presenting of a misleading appearance when it refers to a function-masking decorative detail: <I><FONT color=brown>false</FONT></I> drawers that were actually a single door concealing stereo equipment. <I><FONT color=brown>Ersatz</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>imitation</FONT></I> commonly describes a cheap or inferior copy that can fool no one: bowls of wax fruit, and a dusty collection of <I><FONT color=brown>ersatz</FONT></I> flowers in brass-plated planters.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Make">MAKE</A>, <A href="entry://Sham">SHAM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Genuine">GENUINE</A>, natural.</P>

escalate
<B><FONT color=blue>escalate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>increase</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>intensify</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>step up</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the heightening of something in scale, as pressure, tension, pay or military activity. <B><FONT color=blue>Escalate</FONT></B> is a new word for such buildups; it can imply either a gradual process or a series of sudden or surprise spurts. It is most often used for rising prices and pay rates or for military activity: factors causing the cost of living to escalate during the third quarter; a built-in clause that would <I><FONT color=brown>escalate</FONT></I> their weekly pay to keep pace with rising prices; They <I><FONT color=brown>escalated</FONT></I> the war by mining the enemy’s harbours. As in the second example, the word can suggest two scales rising reciprocally, or one of these rising in response or anticipation of the other: any aggressive act that would <I><FONT color=brown>escalate</FONT></I> the war to a new level of intensity on both sides. The word’s faddish appeal can be seen in the way it replaces simpler words in a wide range of contexts: We <I><FONT color=brown>escalated</FONT></I> our efforts to get the weekender built before summer.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Step up</FONT></B>, by contrast, might more logically suggest a series of spurts with level intervals between them: businesses that must <I><FONT color=brown>step up</FONT></I> production during periods of seasonal demand. This notion is by no means held to, and the word can be used for any single or even gradual act of heightening: immigration quotas that were <I><FONT color=brown>stepped up</FONT></I> by the new policy; directors who inevitably <I><FONT color=brown>step up</FONT></I> their pressure on the actors as opening night approaches.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Increase</FONT></B> is a much more general word than the foregoing and can often replace either to advantage, with a possible gain in simplicity and clarity. While the word can apply to any build-up, its particular point is sometimes to indicate a gain in amount. [The number of people browsing in the bookshop <I><FONT color=brown>increases</FONT></I> sharply during lunch hour.] <B><FONT color=blue>Intensify</FONT></B> is of comparable generality, but it is often directed towards a heightening of pressure, tension or insistence: floods that <I><FONT color=brown>intensified</FONT></I> the force with which the river battered against the weakening levees; the introduction of a plot device to <I><FONT color=brown>intensify</FONT></I> the film’s suspense; arrogant behaviour that only caused the union leaders to <I><FONT color=brown>intensify</FONT></I> their demands.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Extend">EXTEND</A>, <A href="entry://Swell">SWELL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Decrease">DECREASE</A>, <A href="entry://Lessen">LESSEN</A>, <A href="entry://Reduce">REDUCE</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to what has no beginning or no end, or to what exists outside or beyond time. <B><FONT color=blue>Everlasting</FONT></B> stresses something that endures through time, particularly something that will never case to exist, once created. <B><FONT color=blue>Eternal</FONT></B> contrasts with this by admitting the implication that the thing described has always existed in the past, as well, and thus has neither beginning nor end. [In Christian theology, the soul of each newborn infant is fresh creation that is immortal and consequently <I><FONT color=brown>everlasting</FONT></I>; In Hinduism, the soul has no beginning and need never end and is consequently <I><FONT color=brown>eternal</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Everlasting</FONT></I> can also function as a negative hyperbole for a continual or constant annoyance or even for something that seems to take forever and has worn out one’s patience or tolerance; his <I><FONT color=brown>everlasting</FONT></I> boasting; this <I><FONT color=brown>everlasting</FONT></I> war. When negative, eternal is used more loosely, less specifically, and with less force: her <I><FONT color=brown>eternal</FONT></I> carping.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Timeless</FONT></B> may refer more informally than eternal to something without beginning or end: the <I><FONT color=brown>timeless</FONT></I> laws of the universe. Even when used less literally, the word is mainly positive in its effect, referring in this case to something that does not go out of date but seems to be always fresh or relevant: the <I><FONT color=brown>timeless</FONT></I> poetry of Shakespeare. <I><FONT color=brown>Timeless</FONT></I> can also refer to something outside time or to a situation in which time seems to have stopped: It is possible to conceive of a <I><FONT color=brown>timeless</FONT></I> universe, but not one without space; the <I><FONT color=brown>timeless</FONT></I> moment of satori, or enlightenment. <B><FONT color=blue>Unending</FONT></B> refers more informally and exclusively than <I><FONT color=brown>everlasting</FONT></I> to something that has no end: the <I><FONT color=brown>unending</FONT></I> torment of souls condemned to hell; the philosophical view of the universe as being in an <I><FONT color=brown>unending</FONT></I> state of flux. Used less exactly, the word can be either an approving or disapproving hyperbole. In approval, it often suggests what is boundless as well as lasting: She gave her son <I><FONT color=brown>unending</FONT></I> love. In disapproval, a failure to get to the point may be implied: <I><FONT color=brown>unending</FONT></I> negotiations while the fighting continued.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Never-ending</FONT></B> can point, perhaps more emphatically than unending, to what endures forever: the <I><FONT color=brown>never-ending</FONT></I> omniscience of God. As a loose hyperbole, the word can be positive, with a tone approaching that of timeless in this use, but with an additional suggestion of recurrent or continually renewed freshness: fairy tales that have been a <I><FONT color=brown>never-ending</FONT></I> delight for many generations of children. Used negatively, the word may have greater force, suggesting a tiresome refusal to come to a halt: a <I><FONT color=brown>never-ending</FONT></I> bore.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Endless</FONT></B> is the most informal of these words, has the widest range of uses, and is most open to the demands of context. It can refer to something without an end in time: the <I><FONT color=brown>endless</FONT></I> convolutions of matter and energy. But since it can also suggest something that continues without end through space, it can be ambiguous: a theory holding that the universe was <I><FONT color=brown>endless</FONT></I>. As a hyperbole, it can be approving, with implications like those for <I><FONT color=brown>unending</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>endless</FONT></I> admiration; a lovely afternoon that seemed <I><FONT color=brown>endless</FONT></I>. More often, it is loosely used as a harsh negative: <I><FONT color=brown>endless</FONT></I> delays during embarkation. <B><FONT color=blue>Interminable</FONT></B> is the one word here that is almost exclusively limited in use as a negative hyperbole for something that is long-lasting. It is more formal then <I><FONT color=brown>endless</FONT></I> but is less ambiguous than the latter in referring solely to time. It is also the most harshly disapproving of these words: <I><FONT color=brown>interminable</FONT></I> disputations that disrupted the orderly functioning of the committee.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Immortal">IMMORTAL</A>, <A href="entry://Infinite">INFINITE</A>, <A href="entry://Monotonous">MONOTONOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>, <A href="entry://Persistent">PERSISTENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: finite, <A href="entry://Temporary">TEMPORARY</A>.</P>

<P>All these words mean to look something over or inquire into it, usually for a definite purpose. <B><FONT color=blue>Examine</FONT></B> is the general word; it can refer to a cursory look or a thorough study of all details. <B><FONT color=blue>Investigate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>scrutinize</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>inspect</FONT></B> mean to <I><FONT color=brown>examine</FONT></I> thoroughly, but their connotations vary. To <I><FONT color=brown>investigate</FONT></I> is to make a methodical, searching inquiry into a complex situation in an effort to uncover the facts. <I><FONT color=brown>Scrutinize</FONT></I> suggests <I><FONT color=brown>examining</FONT></I> critically and with painstaking attention to detail: a printer <I><FONT color=brown>scrutinizing</FONT></I> a photographic transparency for specks of dust or imperfections. <I><FONT color=brown>Inspect</FONT></I> usually implies that the object of one’s attention is being critically compared to a standard of excellence, quality or the like, with a view towards noting discrepancies or deficiencies in the former: firemen <I><FONT color=brown>inspecting</FONT></I> an abandoned warehouse for potential fire hazards; a sergeant <I><FONT color=brown>inspecting</FONT></I> the rifles of his men. One may <I><FONT color=brown>examine</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>scrutinize</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>inspect</FONT></I> a person, an inanimate object or a situation; <I><FONT color=brown>investigate</FONT></I> is usually applied to situations or events, except in the case of formal inquiries into the lives or actions of a person, because he is suspected of a crime or because he has applied for a job of a particularly sensitive nature: to <I><FONT color=brown>investigate</FONT></I> the background of a potential member of the secret service. [The detective <I><FONT color=brown>investigating</FONT></I> the murder case <I><FONT color=brown>examined</FONT></I> the body, <I><FONT color=brown>inspected</FONT></I> the scene of the crime, and <I><FONT color=brown>scrutinized</FONT></I> the weapon for clues.]</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>audit</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>examine</FONT></I> accounts or records. Thus, to justify an increase in advertising rates, a magazine publisher may engage an outside firm to <I><FONT color=brown>audit</FONT></I> the circulation figures.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scan</FONT></B> is a word that is undergoing a complete reversal of meaning. Its former meaning ?to examine closely and analytically ?is still valid, but is now applied chiefly to analysis of poetic metre: to <I><FONT color=brown>scan</FONT></I> Virgil. More frequently now, <I><FONT color=brown>scan</FONT></I> means to glance quickly at something to get the gist of it: to <I><FONT color=brown>scan</FONT></I> a newspaper by glancing at the headlines.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hunt">HUNT</A>, <A href="entry://Study">STUDY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to something rated as being among the best of its kind. <B><FONT color=blue>Excellent</FONT></B> points literally to something that excels other things. As such, it is often sued to designate the highest class in a grading, rating or ranking system: an eating guide that rated many restaurants as good or very good, but only a few as <I><FONT color=brown>excellent</FONT></I>. Often, however, as with most superlatives, <I><FONT color=brown>excellent</FONT></I> is not thought to be high enough in its praise and it takes second place to some other word: a debating team disappointed at getting an <I><FONT color=brown>Excellent</FONT></I> instead of a Superior rating.</P><P>Neither <B><FONT color=blue>first-class</FONT></B> nor <B><FONT color=blue>first-rate</FONT></B> admits of this sort of devaluation; one thing cannot be more <I><FONT color=brown>first-rate</FONT></I> than another. Both indicate the topmost category in a ranking system. <I><FONT color=brown>First-rate</FONT></I> can suggest a military or paramilitary system: a <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> scout; a <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> marksman. Even outside this context the word would suggest a set of clear categories into which things can be placed by objective evaluation: a <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> motel; <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> mail. As can be seen from the last example, any notion of excellence may well absent from this word’s meaning. Used more loosely and subjectively, the word can describe anything one likes or approves of: a <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> fellow; a <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> movie. <I><FONT color=brown>First-rate</FONT></I> may sometimes suggest careful evaluation based more on imponderable than on objective categorization: feeling in <I><FONT color=brown>first-rate</FONT></I> health; a <I><FONT color=brown>first-rate</FONT></I> analysis of current political tendencies. But while inherent worth is usually indicated by the word, it can sometimes point to something consequential rather than excellent: a <I><FONT color=brown>first-rate</FONT></I> world power. This word is even more open than <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> to uses indicating mere subjective approval: a <I><FONT color=brown>first-rate</FONT></I> girl friend; a <I><FONT color=brown>first-rate</FONT></I> party. Both words can also indicate something that is thought to be supremely bad; <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> may lend itself more readily to this use, but in any case it can give a more informal tone and may have comic force: a <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> heel; a <I><FONT color=brown>first-class</FONT></I> bore; a <I><FONT color=brown>first-rate</FONT></I> disaster.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Prime</FONT></B> can refer to something of first significance, urgency or value: television programmes that appear in <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> time; the <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> need being to get the combatants to the conference table. It can also refer to anything that is <I><FONT color=brown>excellent</FONT></I>, best, most typical or at its peek: <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> beef; <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> theatrical fare; a <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> example; athletes in prime condition. More neutrally, it can suggest the main part of something or what comes first: our <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> reason for deciding to approve the bill; her <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> concern being for the safety of her children. <B><FONT color=blue>Choice</FONT></B>, by contrast, refers to what has been winnowed out, because it fulfils high and discriminating standards. The word is widely used in the merchandising of prepared foods, especially fruit and vegetables; <I><FONT color=brown>choice</FONT></I> garden-fresh peas. Oddly enough, <I><FONT color=brown>choice</FONT></I> often seems stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> in contexts other than the grading of foodstuffs. By implication, what is <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> may be overlooked or easily available, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>choice</FONT></I> suggests the successful discrimination of what is both rare and <I><FONT color=brown>excellent</FONT></I>: their <I><FONT color=brown>choicest</FONT></I> wine from a vast stock that contained nothing of less than <I><FONT color=brown>prime</FONT></I> quality.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Select</FONT></B>, and the variant <I><FONT color=brown>selected</FONT></I>, can refer to timber that is by and large free of blemish or knots. More generally, <I><FONT color=brown>select</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>selected</FONT></I>) compares with <I><FONT color=brown>choice</FONT></I> by stressing discrimination; here again it often relates to tinned or packaged foods: <I><FONT color=brown>selected</FONT></I> golden-ripe apricots in heavy syrup. <I><FONT color=brown>Select</FONT></I> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>choice</FONT></I>, however, in often referring to a mere sampling of <I><FONT color=brown>excellent</FONT></I> things that cannot be presented in full: <I><FONT color=brown>select</FONT></I> highlights from his best-known films. A weakening of <I><FONT color=brown>select’s</FONT></I> force may result by analogy with <I><FONT color=brown>selected</FONT></I> in cases where the latter indicates not a careful process of differentiation but an arbitrary compression or subjective sampling.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Elegant">ELEGANT</A>, <A href="entry://Exquisite">EXQUISITE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bad, faulty, imperfect, <A href="entry://Mediocre">MEDIOCRE</A>, poor, second-class.</P>

<P>These words refer to the sending away or placing apart of a person, group of people, or thing. In some periods of history, a government could punish a citizen by <B><FONT color=blue>exiling</FONT></B> him, that is, by forcing him to leave the homeland. Although few if any modern nations have such a punishment now, the word has remained in the language as a metaphorical reference to any imposed or voluntary separation from one’s home: Budding artists who <I><FONT color=brown>exiled</FONT></I> themselves to Paris to learn the craft of painting; parents who <I><FONT color=brown>exile</FONT></I> their children to kindergartens simply to be rid of them. <B><FONT color=blue>Banish</FONT></B> has a history similar to <I><FONT color=brown>exile</FONT></I>, but its present-day uses permit a wider range of application, suggesting any forcible removal: the judge ordered the hecklers <I><FONT color=brown>banished</FONT></I> from the courtroom; television commercials that promise that their product can <I><FONT color=brown>banish</FONT></I> washday drudgery, <I><FONT color=brown>banish</FONT></I> bad complexions, or <I><FONT color=brown>banish</FONT></I> acid stomach in a twinkling. <B><FONT color=blue>Rusticate</FONT></B> means to send or <I><FONT color=brown>banish</FONT></I> to the country, and especially, in Great Britain, to punish a university student by suspending him and sending him away temporarily.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Relegate</FONT></B>, in reference to people, suggests disposing of them without much concern for their welfare: <I><FONT color=brown>relegating</FONT></I> Aborigines to second-class citizenship; <I><FONT color=brown>relegating</FONT></I> newly elected members to a role of watchful silence. In reference to other matters, <I><FONT color=brown>relegate</FONT></I> suggests their assignment to an unimportant place: <I><FONT color=brown>relegating</FONT></I> his fears to a corner of her mind reserved for the trivial and forgettable.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deport</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>expatriate</FONT></B> both have present-day technical uses like those that <I><FONT color=brown>exile</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>banish</FONT></I> once had. <I><FONT color=brown>Deport</FONT></I> refers to the official sending away of someone who is not a citizen: <I><FONT color=brown>deporting</FONT></I> the criminal who had entered the country illegally. <I><FONT color=brown>Expatriate</FONT></I> himself to a country more to his liking; a law to <I><FONT color=brown>expatriate</FONT></I> those who serve in a foreign army.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sequester</FONT></B> means to place apart or separate. It differs from the other words here considered in emphasizing separation rather than the action of sending away: to <I><FONT color=brown>sequester</FONT></I> a construction area in which blasting is necessary. In a related sense, <I><FONT color=brown>sequester</FONT></I> applies to people and is often used reflexively with the meaning of making private or secret or of being secluded. [She lived a <I><FONT color=brown>sequestered</FONT></I> life in a mountain village; He <I><FONT color=brown>sequestered</FONT></I> himself for the summer in an oceanfront cottage to write his first novel.] The emphasis is still on placing apart, but additional stress is given to the motive ?that of secrecy or seclusion.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impel">IMPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Privacy">PRIVACY</A>, <A href="entry://Remove">REMOVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Greet">GREET</A>.</P>

exist
<B><FONT color=blue>exist</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>be</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>live</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>subsist</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are alike in referring to conditions or things having actual presence or reality. <B><FONT color=blue>Exist</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>be</FONT></B> (here considered only as a substantive verb) are interchangeable when a flat assertion of reality is intended: God <I><FONT color=brown>exists</FONT></I>; God <I><FONT color=brown>is</FONT></I>. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>be</FONT></I> is the more forceful, carrying the weight of intense personal conviction; <I><FONT color=brown>exist</FONT></I> has a more detached connotation, more often suggesting that a record is simply being made of observable or otherwise known phenomena. In other senses <I><FONT color=brown>exist</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>be</FONT></I> are not commonly interchangeable. <I><FONT color=brown>Exist</FONT></I> can mean to continue to <I><FONT color=brown>be</FONT></I>: are not commonly interchangeable. <I><FONT color=brown>Exist</FONT></I> can mean to continue to <I><FONT color=brown>be</FONT></I>: Animals cannot <I><FONT color=brown>exist</FONT></I> without oxygen. <I><FONT color=brown>Be</FONT></I> can be used to designate that something <I><FONT color=brown>exists</FONT></I> in a particular place or time: There <I><FONT color=brown>are</FONT></I> bears in the zoo.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Live</FONT></B> means to have life, to function as an animate organism: There dazed survivor of the collision asked whether his brother was <I><FONT color=brown>living</FONT></I> or dead. <I><FONT color=brown>Live</FONT></I> is commonly used to mean to continue in existence, to remain alive, and in this sense is sometimes interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>exist</FONT></I>: Animals cannot <I><FONT color=brown>live</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>exist</FONT></I>) without oxygen. But when it refers to a particular place or time, it parallels <I><FONT color=brown>be</FONT></I>. [Kangaroos <I><FONT color=brown>live</FONT></I> in Australia; There <I><FONT color=brown>are</FONT></I> Kangaroos in Australia.] </P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Subsist</FONT></B>, which has the etymological meaning of to stand under, means to maintain one’s existence or mange to <I><FONT color=brown>live</FONT></I>, and often suggests a relation between existence or life and the conditions which support it: For three months the stranded sailors <I><FONT color=brown>subsisted</FONT></I> solely on indigenous plants and an occasional fish washed ashore. Although either <I><FONT color=brown>exist</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>live</FONT></I> could be used in the foregoing example, <I><FONT color=brown>subsist</FONT></I> emphasizes the dependence of life on the conditions described more strongly than either of the other words. <I><FONT color=brown>Subsist</FONT></I> is less commonly and more formally used today to refer to anything that has existence or reality, or that continues to <I><FONT color=brown>exist</FONT></I>: beauty that <I><FONT color=brown>subsisted</FONT></I> in the brilliantly conceived concordance between colour and form within the painting. Even here a contingent relation is suggested.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Flourish">FLOURISH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Die">DIE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all mean to clear of guilt or wrongdoing. <B><FONT color=blue>Exonerate</FONT></B> means to free from accusation or blame, and stresses freedom from future suspicion: The hearings before the subcommittee <I><FONT color=brown>exonerated</FONT></I> him from suspicion of complicity in the swindle. To <B><FONT color=blue>absolve</FONT></B> is to set free from obligation or penalty attaching to an act: The aircraft company was <I><FONT color=brown>absolved</FONT></I> from liability following the investigation of the disaster. To <B><FONT color=blue>acquit</FONT></B> is to set free from accusation, usually for lack of evidence, and often of a specific charge: to be <I><FONT color=brown>acquitted</FONT></I> of perjury. [The motorist was <I><FONT color=brown>acquitted</FONT></I> of reckless driving; he was thereupon <I><FONT color=brown>absolved</FONT></I> from any claim for damages arising out of the collision.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Vindicate</FONT></B> means to clear completely through the examination of evidence. [The accused bookkeeper <I><FONT color=brown>vindicated</FONT></I> himself by producing bank statements; The testimony of witnesses <I><FONT color=brown>vindicated</FONT></I> the prisoner.] It may also refer to judgement which has been borne out by subsequent events: The judge’s minority dissent was finally <I><FONT color=brown>vindicated</FONT></I> in later years when the majority endorsed his arguments and reversed its former decision. <B><FONT color=blue>Exculpate</FONT></B> means to free from blame or prove innocent of guilt or fault. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>exonerate</FONT></I>, it does not necessarily imply that a formal charge was made nor that the blameworthy act was illegal or illicit. It may apply to any culpable action: Investigation <I><FONT color=brown>exculpated</FONT></I> the driver from the suspicion of having caused the accident.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Innocent">INNOCENT</A>, <A href="entry://Pardon">PARDON</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accuse">ACCUSE</A>, inculpate.</P>

<P>These words all point to the future, and the likelihood of certain events or conditions taking place. <B><FONT color=blue>Expectation</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>expectancy</FONT></B> are close synonyms meaning the waiting for something to happen, or the probability with which the awaited can be presumed to happen. [There had been no <I><FONT color=brown>expectation</FONT></I> of war with the Japanese until their abrupt attack on Pearl Harbour; Those who drop out of school must lower their <I><FONT color=brown>expectation</FONT></I> of success.] <I><FONT color=brown>Expectancy</FONT></I> is used to describe a state of tense <I><FONT color=brown>expectation</FONT></I>: There was an air of <I><FONT color=brown>expectancy</FONT></I> as the Prime Minister rose to his feet to make a statement. It is also commonly encountered in the phrase life <I><FONT color=brown>expectancy</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Anticipation</FONT></B>, in this context, is a strong <I><FONT color=brown>expectation</FONT></I> based on fore-knowledge. [The <I><FONT color=brown>anticipation</FONT></I> of rising floodwaters leads the farmer to move his stock to higher ground; building up the armed forces in <I><FONT color=brown>anticipation</FONT></I> of war.] <B><FONT color=blue>Hope</FONT></B>, as here considered, is <I><FONT color=brown>expectation</FONT></I> based on desire, with or without any likelihood that the hoped-for will happen or materialize. [Parents have high <I><FONT color=brown>hopes</FONT></I> for their children; A man saves money in the <I><FONT color=brown>hope</FONT></I> that inflation will not wipe it out.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Outlook</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>prospect</FONT></B> refer to future probabilities based on present indications or analyses.

<P>These words describe things that cost a lot, especially with reference to money. <B><FONT color=blue>Expensive</FONT></B> refers to things that cost a lot of money but that give pleasure and satisfaction because of their good looks or high quality: to live in an <I><FONT color=brown>expensive</FONT></I> flat; to frequent expensive restaurants. <I><FONT color=brown>Expensive</FONT></I> also hints at a tendency to extravagance: to have <I><FONT color=brown>expensive</FONT></I> tastes in clothes or wines. Something that is <I><FONT color=brown>expensive</FONT></I> may cost more than the purchaser thinks it is worth to him, but it also may be more than he is able to pay ?or thinks it practical to pay. [That is a beautiful coat, but it is too <I><FONT color=brown>expensive</FONT></I> for me; We really don’t need such a big, <I><FONT color=brown>expensive</FONT></I> car.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>High-priced</FONT></B> is the most general term and the least specific. That which is <I><FONT color=brown>high-priced</FONT></I> simply costs a lot of money, either in an absolute sense or in a relative one. The word carries little suggestion of real value, quality, or desirability.</P><P>Something that is <B><FONT color=blue>costly</FONT></B> is very <I><FONT color=brown>expensive</FONT></I>, but for the reason that is rare, elegant or of superior workmanship: a <I><FONT color=brown>costly</FONT></I> diamond necklace; <I><FONT color=brown>costly</FONT></I> Persian rugs. In another sense, <I><FONT color=brown>expensive</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>costly</FONT></I> may both have reference to something that demands unusual effort or time, or that taxes one’s resources beyond a reasonable limit. [A long illness is an <I><FONT color=brown>expensive</FONT></I> misfortune for the average family; This is a <I><FONT color=brown>costly</FONT></I> war in terms of the number of men killed and wounded.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dear</FONT></B> is the direct opposite of cheap. Most people aspire to own expensive or <I><FONT color=brown>costly</FONT></I> things, but not those that are <I><FONT color=brown>dear</FONT></I> or high-priced. <I><FONT color=brown>Dear</FONT></I> is applied chiefly to ordinary commodities which have risen in price because they are temporarily in short supply. [In the middle of the summer, fresh oranges are <I><FONT color=brown>dear</FONT></I>, but in the winter months they are cheap; During World War II nylon stockings were very <I><FONT color=brown>dear</FONT></I> and hard to come by.]</P><P>Anything is <B><FONT color=blue>overpriced</FONT></B> when it is offered for sale at a price much higher than its actual value warrants: shops selling <I><FONT color=brown>overpriced</FONT></I> antiques in a fashionable suburb.

<P>The words in this list all mean an undertaking to make the meaning of something clear to oneself or to someone else. <B><FONT color=blue>Explanation</FONT></B> is the broadest of these words, and is applied to ideas, utterances, actions or operations. It is often used in place of may of the other words in the list.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>definition</FONT></B> is, etymologically, a setting of limits or boundaries. In this context it is used to give the exact meaning of a word or phrase, or to delimit a problem or an undertaking.

A <I><FONT color=brown>description</FONT></I> may have as its object merely the pleasure of the listener or reader: a <I><FONT color=brown>description</FONT></I> of a sunset. As here considered, however, a description has a didactic purpose.

explode
<B><FONT color=blue>explode</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>burst</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bust</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>erupt</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all mean to break out, open or apart in a sudden and violent way, as if from some internal force. <B><FONT color=blue>Explode</FONT></B> has specific reference to the physical phenomenon which occurs when any substance or mixture of substances react on impact or by ignition with a sudden expansion of gases and the liberation of relatively large amounts of thermal energy. <I><FONT color=brown>Explode</FONT></I>, in this sense of blowing up, suggests more violence and noise than any of the other words in this group. [The bomb <I><FONT color=brown>exploded</FONT></I> at a great distance from our observation point but with so much noise that I was deafened for several minutes.] The same kind of noisy breaking out is implied when <I><FONT color=brown>explode</FONT></I> is used figuratively to indicate the sudden release of an emotion: to <I><FONT color=brown>explode</FONT></I> with laughter; to <I><FONT color=brown>explode</FONT></I> with anger. Another figurative usage of explode is its designation of the destruction of something by disproving, refuting or discrediting it: to <I><FONT color=brown>explode</FONT></I> an out-of-date theory; a tissue of lies that was <I><FONT color=brown>exploded</FONT></I> by an honest slip of the tongue. <B><FONT color=blue>Burst</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>explode</FONT></I>, can mean to blow up: the sound of shells <I><FONT color=brown>bursting</FONT></I> over our heads. It has, however, more general applications than <I><FONT color=brown>explode</FONT></I> in the sense of breaking out or apart. Here, in a literal or figurative way, it suggests the energy produced by a sudden release from confinement or the force generated by great tension: a dam that <I><FONT color=brown>burst</FONT></I> during a season of heavy floods; the feeling that one is about to <I><FONT color=brown>burst</FONT></I> from overeating; to die as a result of a blood vessel that <I><FONT color=brown>burst</FONT></I> in the brain. <I><FONT color=brown>Burst</FONT></I> is also used figuratively like <I><FONT color=brown>explode</FONT></I> to denote the expressing of an emotion: a man who was <I><FONT color=brown>bursting</FONT></I> with resentment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Erupt</FONT></B>, which is also used literally and figuratively, means to <I><FONT color=brown>burst</FONT></I> forth or to break out. In this word, as in the one sense of <I><FONT color=brown>burst</FONT></I>, there is an implication that the <I><FONT color=brown>bursting</FONT></I> or breaking out is done from a restrictive place or condition. [Hot ashes and molten lava <I><FONT color=brown>erupted</FONT></I> from the volcano; angry oaths suddenly <I><FONT color=brown>erupted</FONT></I> from the man who had been fighting to keep his temper under control.] <B><FONT color=blue>Bust</FONT></B>, in the sense pertinent to this comparison, means to break open or apart.

<P>These words refer to what reflects rare beauty or delicacy in taste, fashion or manners. <B><FONT color=blue>Exquisite</FONT></B> is extremely vague as a superlative used in any of these situations; to these notions it adds overtones of what is consummate in its execution, admirable in effect, and gives evidence of extreme sensitivity, discrimination and fastidiousness: <I><FONT color=brown>exquisite</FONT></I> miniatures showing the greatest delicacy in their use of colour; a ballet cancer of exquisite skill; an <I><FONT color=brown>exquisite</FONT></I> day, breathtaking in its beauty. The word can also refer to what is keen or acute: suffering the most <I><FONT color=brown>exquisite</FONT></I> torment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Polished</FONT></B> is metaphorical as it applies here, suggesting a correctness in manner and an elegance of grooming that has been carefully learnt or inculcated: the <I><FONT color=brown>polished</FONT></I> society of the 1890s. The word can also refer to technical facility: a <I><FONT color=brown>polished</FONT></I> performance of the <I><FONT color=brown>exquisite</FONT></I> sonata. <B><FONT color=blue>Refined</FONT></B> extends the implications of <I><FONT color=brown>polished</FONT></I> to a larger range of uses. It can refer beyond manners to aesthetic excellence or taste in the widest sense, often suggesting the arduous process of separating what is valuable from what is dross: <I><FONT color=brown>refined</FONT></I> manners; a <I><FONT color=brown>refined</FONT></I> style, free of flaw or eccentricity; observing that art was nothing more than life <I><FONT color=brown>refined</FONT></I>. Often, however, the word can refer to what has become too rigidly correct, mannered, lifeless or genteel: a <I><FONT color=brown>refined</FONT></I> and bloodless prose style; <I><FONT color=brown>refined</FONT></I> taste that found the explosive complexities of Greek drama too tick for its palate.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Soigné</FONT></B>, borrowed from the French, places an emphasis on good grooming. It stresses elegance and modishness as well: the latest <I><FONT color=brown>soigné</FONT></I> fashions for women. <B><FONT color=blue>Graceful</FONT></B> most vividly suggests physical bearing or movement that is lithe, agile and lyrical: a <I><FONT color=brown>graceful</FONT></I> walk. It can also indicate delicately smooth execution in the arts: a <I><FONT color=brown>graceful</FONT></I> modelling of the female nude. It can point as well to manners that show poise, calmness and correctness: her <I><FONT color=brown>graceful</FONT></I> way of making introductions. <B><FONT color=blue>Fine</FONT></B>, in this context, can refer to minute, delicate or perfectly executed ornamentation or detailing: the <I><FONT color=brown>fine</FONT></I> carving of the filigree scroll framing the bas-relief. It can also suggest something <I><FONT color=brown>refined</FONT></I> or of high merit: <I><FONT color=brown>fine</FONT></I> manners; the <I><FONT color=brown>fine</FONT></I> arts. Less strictly, of course, it can be a vague superlative for anything one regards favourably: a <I><FONT color=brown>fine</FONT></I> film; a <I><FONT color=brown>fine</FONT></I> painter; a <I><FONT color=brown>fine</FONT></I> friend.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Elegant">ELEGANT</A>, <A href="entry://Excellent">EXCELLENT</A>, <A href="entry://Orderly">ORDERLY</A>, <A href="entry://Urbane">URBANE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clumsy">CLUMSY</A>, coarse, common, <A href="entry://Gauche">GAUCHE</A>, <A href="entry://Rough">ROUGH</A>, untutored, <A href="entry://Vulgar">VULGAR</A>.</P>

<P>These words agree in meaning to increase in one or more dimensions. <B><FONT color=blue>Extend</FONT></B>, as here considered, means to increase a thing’s length, breadth or duration. An army may <I><FONT color=brown>extend</FONT></I> its supply lines; a bird <I><FONT color=brown>extends</FONT></I> its wings when soaring; and a tedious preacher may <I><FONT color=brown>extend</FONT></I> his sermon beyond his congregation’s span of attention.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lengthen</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>draw out</FONT></B> mean to extend a thing in length or in duration, but not in breadth. <I><FONT color=brown>Draw out</FONT></I> sometimes even implies a loss of breadth accompanying the increase in length; metal wires become both longer and thinner when they are draw out, <B><FONT color=blue>elongate</FONT></B> is used only to mean to <I><FONT color=brown>lengthen</FONT></I> spatially, not in time, and, like <I><FONT color=brown>draw out</FONT></I>, sometimes implies to <I><FONT color=brown>extend</FONT></I> in length at the expense of breadth, but in any case suggests disproportionately great length: one of the sculptor Giacometti’s mournful <I><FONT color=brown>elongated</FONT></I> figures.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Prolong</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>protract</FONT></B> now usually refer to extended time, although <I><FONT color=brown>prolong</FONT></I> may also refer to space. <I><FONT color=brown>Prolong</FONT></I> implies an extension beyond natural or normal limits: to <I><FONT color=brown>prolong</FONT></I> the meeting until a quorum could be rounded up; to <I><FONT color=brown>prolong</FONT></I> a war by inept diplomacy and miscalculation of the enemy’s aims. <I><FONT color=brown>Protract</FONT></I> means to draw out or extend greatly in time; it is often used adjectivally: <I><FONT color=brown>protracted</FONT></I> negotiations covering four months of serious discussions.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stretch</FONT></B>, as here considered, means to <I><FONT color=brown>extend</FONT></I> a thing in length, breathe or in both dimensions: to <I><FONT color=brown>stretch</FONT></I> a sweater by pegging it out while wet. <I><FONT color=brown>Stretch</FONT></I> is now also used as an adjective applied to articles of clothing made of synthetic fibres that can be <I><FONT color=brown>stretched</FONT></I> to fit a variety of sizes: <I><FONT color=brown>stretch</FONT></I> socks. Widen means to increase only a thing’s breadth: to widen a highway by adding two lanes. Widen, like <I><FONT color=brown>extend</FONT></I>, may be used figuratively to apply to any broadening: to widen (or extend) one’s interests to include the study of nature.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Escalate">ESCALATE</A>, <A href="entry://Persist">PERSIST</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: contract, cut short, narrow, <A href="entry://Shorten">SHORTEN</A>, shrink, terminate, truncate.</P>

<P>These words all mean to make seem less wrong, evil, blameworthy, etc. <B><FONT color=blue>Extenuate</FONT></B> suggests the effort to lessen the blame incurred by an offence, usually by offering partial excuses.

<P>These words refer to whatever is not an inherent part of a given consideration or entity. <B><FONT color=blue>Extraneous</FONT></B> stress something that is not necessary or has no bearing, but the word is otherwise very general in its implications. It does suggest a difference in kind: sorting out the hard-core facts from the <I><FONT color=brown>extraneous</FONT></I> interpretation. The unnecessary element referred to may, if not excluded, her either harmless or deleterious: <I><FONT color=brown>extraneous</FONT></I> substances that make the sunburn preparation smell pleasant but have no healing effect; extraneous minerals in the water supply that made it unsafe to drink. Superfluous is different in its effect, often pointing to simple excess, not a difference in kind: wiping away the superfluous oil with a lean rag. Even where the word shows a less clear-cut contrast with extraneous, it still points to what is useless or redundant: a room cluttered with superfluous furniture.</P><P>By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>extrinsic</FONT></B> functions as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>extraneous</FONT></I>, emphasizing that something is by its very nature completely unlike a given entity or completely outside the scope of some concern: pointing out that oxygen consumption might well be <I><FONT color=brown>extrinsic</FONT></I> to the life cycle as it may have developed in other parts of the universe; literary standards that are <I><FONT color=brown>extrinsic</FONT></I> to any understanding of popular media. <B><FONT color=blue>Inessential</FONT></B> is more like <I><FONT color=brown>extraneous</FONT></I> in referring to what may be present and tolerated but is in any case not needed and may therefore be excluded by choice or necessity: an editor who helped the novelist cut from his book those scenes that were <I><FONT color=brown>inessential</FONT></I> to the main theme; ordering the people in the lifeboat to throw overboard everything that was <I><FONT color=brown>inessential</FONT></I> to their survival.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Immaterial</FONT></B> refers not to what is unnecessary, in excess or unlike something else, but to what has no effect or makes no difference: She told him that it was <I><FONT color=brown>immaterial</FONT></I> to her whether he stayed or left. In the context of reasoning, the word may point to what contributes nothing to an objective proof and thus is unimportant: the judge’s ruling that the political beliefs of the accused were <I><FONT color=brown>immaterial</FONT></I> to the question of his guilt. <B><FONT color=blue>Irrelevant</FONT></B> also indicates what is unimportant or inapplicable, in this case because it lacks any direct bearing on the concern at hand: proof that the mother’s dreams were <I><FONT color=brown>irrelevant</FONT></I> to the development of the foetus. Most specifically, the word suggests a lack of logical relationship as in a non sequitur: injecting <I><FONT color=brown>irrelevant</FONT></I> details about the man’s life into our consideration of his candidacy.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Marginal">MARGINAL</A>, <A href="entry://Trivial">TRIVIAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: essential, intrinsic, material, relevant, <A href="entry://Significant">SIGNIFICANT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a loose grouping of like-minded people within a larger aggregate. <B><FONT color=blue>Faction</FONT></B> suggests a relatively small grouping that coheres because of attitudes or objectives that are different from that of others in the larger whole. A <I><FONT color=brown>faction</FONT></I>, by implication, is more concerned with winning acceptance for its views than for the welfare or effectiveness of the parent group; rather than compromise these views a <I><FONT color=brown>faction</FONT></I> might leave the parent body and form a rival group. Thus, the word may have pejorative connotations ranging from stubbornness, disharmony, to outright disloyalty: He begged them to set party unity above the bickering of <I><FONT color=brown>factions</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>splinter group</FONT></B> is an even more cohesive and well-defined unit that has broken away from the larger parent group, or is about to do so, usually because of doctrinal disagreement; it may be of doubtful stability or endurance: <I><FONT color=brown>splinter groups</FONT></I> that sided with their party on the main issue but against it on several smaller ones; a movement that was destroyed by its tendency to break into <I><FONT color=brown>splinter groups</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Sect</FONT></B> is used primarily of religious groups that adhere to their own special doctrines and either remain loosely associated with a larger group or break away from it completely: the formation of a number of Protestant <I><FONT color=brown>sects</FONT></I>. The word may also be used for any identifiable groupings within a dogmatic aggregate: Maoist <I><FONT color=brown>sects</FONT></I> at work within de-Stalinized countries.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bloc</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wing</FONT></B> refer to far larger groupings than the previous words. Both also refer to much looser allegiances. <I><FONT color=brown>Wing</FONT></I>, however, need not suggest actual membership in some organized parent group so much as a definable position within a spectrum of possibility: a rare agreement between the left and right <I><FONT color=brown>wings</FONT></I> of the country’s political sentiment; disclosures that should be satisfying to gadflies of the <I><FONT color=brown>right wing</FONT></I>. More strictly, the word can apply within an organized group, but still with the idea of an extreme position on that group’s scale of values: co-operation between the <I><FONT color=brown>left wing</FONT></I> of the Conservative Party and the <I><FONT color=brown>right wing</FONT></I> of the Labour Party in Britain. One could not, obviously, refer to middle-ground sentiment by using this word. <I><FONT color=brown>Bloc</FONT></I> is not restricted, like <I><FONT color=brown>wing</FONT></I>, to suggesting simple polarization along a scale of values. It refers to a practical alliance of strength and consequently need not stress ideological intransigence at all: a power <I><FONT color=brown>bloc</FONT></I> made up of several political shadings. The word suggests a joining of forces fostered by threatened security, rivalry and the will to survive: African delegates that vote as a <I><FONT color=brown>bloc</FONT></I> in the U.N. Assembly. The word is sometimes like <I><FONT color=brown>wing</FONT></I>, however, in suggesting no parent group that overarches rival <I><FONT color=brown>blocs</FONT></I>: the neutralist <I><FONT color=brown>bloc</FONT></I> of nations; the rival power <I><FONT color=brown>blocs</FONT></I> of East and West.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Addition">ADDITION</A>, <A href="entry://Component">COMPONENT</A>, <A href="entry://Denomination">DENOMINATION</A>, <A href="entry://Part">PART</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to enter a state of unconsciousness, impairment of awareness or extreme weakness. To <B><FONT color=blue>faint</FONT></B> is to lose consciousness suddenly because of a temporary deficiency of the blood supply to the brain. <I><FONT color=brown>Fainting</FONT></I> (for which the medical term is syncope) may be caused by emotional shock, pain, over-exertion or exposure to high temperatures. <B><FONT color=blue>Swoon</FONT></B> was once a synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>faint</FONT></I>, but is now obsolescent. <I><FONT color=brown>Swoon</FONT></I> appears widely in literature of the past, especially in the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, where it often evokes the stock image of the delicate, vapourish lady of the Victorian period who habitually <I><FONT color=brown>faints</FONT></I> when under stress or in the grip of strong feelings: She <I><FONT color=brown>swooned</FONT></I> under the rain of his kisses; to <I><FONT color=brown>swoon</FONT></I> at the sight of blood.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Black out</FONT></B> is used of aircraft pilots experiencing partial or complete loss of vision and sometimes of consciousness, caused by rapid changes in velocity during flight. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>black out</FONT></I> has come to mean any temporary memory lapse, usually without <I><FONT color=brown>fainting</FONT></I>, especially one resulting from emotional tension or the consumption of large amounts of alcohol. [The accused claimed that he had <I><FONT color=brown>blacked out</FONT></I> and did not remember strangling the murdered man; Jonathan was able to recall very little of what happened at the party because he <I><FONT color=brown>black out</FONT></I> early in the evening.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pass out</FONT></B> is an informal term for <I><FONT color=brown>faint</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>pass out</FONT></I> from the heat; to <I><FONT color=brown>pass out</FONT></I> from fright. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>faint</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>pass out</FONT></I> carries a suggestion of humour with little or no medical connotation, especially in its most popular use to describe falling into the stuporous sleep that overtakes some people after they have had too much to drink: a derelict who had <I><FONT color=brown>passed out</FONT></I> in a doorway; She was able to down one cocktail after another without <I><FONT color=brown>passing out</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Collapse</FONT></B> is a much stronger term than the other words and may indicate grave illness. To <I><FONT color=brown>collapse</FONT></I> may also involve <I><FONT color=brown>fainting</FONT></I>, but the word, from its literal meaning of giving way or caving in, emphasizes a complete and sudden loss of vital strength or health, which may be either brief or prolonged: those who <I><FONT color=brown>collapse</FONT></I> into bed after an exhausting day; He <I><FONT color=brown>collapsed</FONT></I> from overwork; to <I><FONT color=brown>collapse</FONT></I> from nervous strain; to <I><FONT color=brown>collapse</FONT></I> with a heart attack.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Sickness">SICKNESS</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: come to, rally, revive.</P>

<P>These words refer to people or things that are widely known. <B><FONT color=blue>Famous</FONT></B> is the most general of these, the least formal, and the weakest in connotations. It refers simply to anything that has gained the attention of many people for whatever reason: a <I><FONT color=brown>famous</FONT></I> film star; a country <I><FONT color=brown>famous</FONT></I> for its good cooking. While the word does carry a positive connotation, it may suggest popularity or general recognition rather than discriminating approval or inherent excellence: a meeting between the <I><FONT color=brown>famous</FONT></I> popularizer and the less well known originator of the theory.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Celebrated</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>renowned</FONT></B> are intensifications of <I><FONT color=brown>famous</FONT></I>, both specifically adding the note of wide approval for accomplishment. <I><FONT color=brown>Renowned</FONT></I> is the more formal of the two and might seem too precious in some uses; its emphasis is also on the wideness of the acclaim rather than on discrimination. It is most viable now, perhaps, for places or things rather than for people: a world-<I><FONT color=brown>renowned</FONT></I> castle on the Rhine. It may also suggest something that has become legendary or is no longer available for an objective evaluation and must be approached through admiring but second-hand reports: the <I><FONT color=brown>renowned</FONT></I> band of Spartans who held Thermopylae. <I><FONT color=brown>Celebrated</FONT></I> refers, more objectively, to someone or something that has been given acclaim or honoured with awards or prizes: a <I><FONT color=brown>celebrated</FONT></I> Nobel Prize winner. It can, sometimes, function like <I><FONT color=brown>famous</FONT></I> in indicating a more popular or less critical approval: the most <I><FONT color=brown>celebrated</FONT></I> of the <I><FONT color=brown>famous</FONT></I> film stars. Sometimes the word can be a less formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>renowned</FONT></I>: a cathedral <I><FONT color=brown>celebrated</FONT></I> in song and story.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Noted</FONT></B> is unique among these words in specifically suggesting that accomplishment is singled out for notice because of its excellence. It is often used to describe a more intellectual kind of effort, indicating an authority or expert or their theories: a <I><FONT color=brown>noted</FONT></I> authority on bee-keeping; a <I><FONT color=brown>noted</FONT></I> critic of new fiction. Because of this use, <I><FONT color=brown>noted</FONT></I> points to a much more limited general recognition than those other words; a <I><FONT color=brown>noted</FONT></I> expert, while honoured by others in his field, might not be known widely to the general public at all. <B><FONT color=blue>Notorious</FONT></B>, in sharp contrast to all these words, indicates someone or something that has become famous because of its undesirable or offensive behaviour: the <I><FONT color=brown>notorious</FONT></I> immorality of Hollywood in its hey-day; a <I><FONT color=brown>notorious</FONT></I> criminal.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Great">GREAT</A>, <A href="entry://Outstanding">OUTSTANDING</A>, <A href="entry://Significant">SIGNIFICANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: fugitive, inglorious, <A href="entry://Obscure">OBSCURE</A>, unknown.</P>

<P>These words, both as nouns and modifiers, refer to the greatest distance, the most inclusive boundary of something, the point of its greatest extension, or to anything at its most ample or serious. <B><FONT color=blue>Farthest</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>furthest</FONT></B> are the superlative forms of <I><FONT color=brown>farther</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>further</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Farthest</FONT></I> applies strictly to the greatest distance, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>furthest</FONT></I> can not only apply identically, with no distinction in shading and meaning, but also to many other situations here, both literal and figurative, particularly where the notions of movement or progress are present. [Which of these cities are the <I><FONT color=brown>farthest</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>furthest</FONT></I>) from us? This line marks the <I><FONT color=brown>farthest</FONT></I> advance of the glacier; behaviour reflecting the <I><FONT color=brown>furthest</FONT></I> departure from the norm.] <B><FONT color=blue>Outermost</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>farthest</FONT></I> in referring strictly to distance, but it is even more specific in suggesting the outside of a plane or solid figure: the <I><FONT color=brown>outermost</FONT></I> layer of skin; the <I><FONT color=brown>outermost</FONT></I> periphery of the Roman Empire’s influence; the <I><FONT color=brown>outermost</FONT></I> planet.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Extreme</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ultimate</FONT></B> are considerably more general than the other words here; each, however, has an occasionally used area of specific reference. <I><FONT color=brown>Extreme</FONT></I> can apply like <I><FONT color=brown>farthest</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>outmost</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>extreme</FONT></I> edge of the desert. When it refers more generally to great amounts, degrees or intensities, it often suggests an unwise, excessive or grave departure from the norm: the <I><FONT color=brown>extreme</FONT></I> left wing of the party; He always went to <I><FONT color=brown>extremes</FONT></I> with his drinking; an <I><FONT color=brown>extreme</FONT></I> illness. But the word can be compared and, hence, may not be as forceful as <I><FONT color=brown>furthest</FONT></I>: the more <I><FONT color=brown>extreme</FONT></I> of the two positions; Which of these <I><FONT color=brown>extreme</FONT></I> factions went <I><FONT color=brown>furthest</FONT></I> in its demands? <I><FONT color=brown>Ultimate</FONT></I> can refer to something that is last in space or either first or last in time: the <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> island in the archipelago; the modern word’s <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> form in Indo-European; the mystery isn’t unravelled until the <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> chapter of the book. More commonly, the word refers to a final outcome: the <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> results of our foreign policy. At its most general, <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> functions more vaguely to indicate the most <I><FONT color=brown>extreme</FONT></I> or perfect from of something: the <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> catastrophe; a hotel that was the <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> in luxury.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Utmost</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>uttermost</FONT></B> are the most formal of these words and can refer very generally to anything at its greatest, most <I><FONT color=brown>extreme</FONT></I>, or best. <I><FONT color=brown>Utmost</FONT></I> can apply like the last use of <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>utmost</FONT></I> in craftsmanship. An added suggestion here, as in its other uses, may be one of the extreme effort required to reach some goal: We will do our utmost to get it delivered on time. <I><FONT color=brown>Uttermost</FONT></I> can seem like an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>utmost</FONT></I> in some uses: a crisis that will demand our <I><FONT color=brown>uttermost</FONT></I> in time and patience. Often, the word suggests something severe or final: the martyr’s <I><FONT color=brown>uttermost</FONT></I> sacrifice of his life; his <I><FONT color=brown>uttermost</FONT></I> agony. At its most specific, the word, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>utmost</FONT></I>, can also apply more neutrally to distance: the <I><FONT color=brown>uttermost</FONT></I> tip of South America.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boundary">BOUNDARY</A>, <A href="entry://Final">FINAL</A>, <A href="entry://Highest">HIGHEST</A>, <A href="entry://Summit">SUMMIT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: closest, initial, inmost, least, mildest, nearest.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>fat</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>adipose</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>buxom</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>chubby</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>corpulent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>obese</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>plump</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>portly</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stout</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a physique that is fleshy or overweight. <B><FONT color=blue>Fat</FONT></B> is the most informal and also the most concrete and direct of these words: a woman who was unbelievably <I><FONT color=brown>fat</FONT></I>. The word does, however, recognize degrees of this condition: a young man who already looked slightly <I><FONT color=brown>fat</FONT></I>. By contrast, both <B><FONT color=blue>corpulent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>obese</FONT></B> refer to excessive states of overweight; they are also much more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>fat</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Obese</FONT></I> is the clinical term used to describe this condition when it is considered medically rather than aesthetically and with particular reference to its endangering of health; consequently an unequivocally extreme case is indicated: the incidence of heart failure in <I><FONT color=brown>obese</FONT></I> persons. <I><FONT color=brown>Corpulent</FONT></I> refers, literally, to fleshiness of physique, especially in the stomach, but also may suggest bulk or overall heaviness rather than a medically <I><FONT color=brown>obese</FONT></I> condition; it would thus not require so extreme a case to become applicable: a smiling <I><FONT color=brown>corpulent</FONT></I> Buddha.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Portly</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stout</FONT></B> are both genteel euphemisms for fat, especially used to describe elderly people. <I><FONT color=brown>Portly</FONT></I> suggests dignity of bearing in a figure of great girth; <I><FONT color=brown>stout</FONT></I> suggests a general heaviness of physique: the <I><FONT color=brown>portly</FONT></I> matrons who served tea after the recital; the <I><FONT color=brown>stout</FONT></I> innkeeper with the cherubic face.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Plump</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>buxom</FONT></B> indicate the slightest degree of overweight suggested by any of these words; both can be approving rather than disapproving. <I><FONT color=brown>Plump</FONT></I> suggests a soft ripeness of figure that is thought attractive: Rubens?<I><FONT color=brown>plump</FONT></I> female figures that would today be considered <I><FONT color=brown>fat</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>plump</FONT></I> baby. The word can , of course, be used euphemistically: the <I><FONT color=brown>plump</FONT></I>, pot-bellied scoutmaster and his scrawny charges. <I><FONT color=brown>Buxom</FONT></I> is restricted to describing a plump or well-developed woman, especially one radiating sturdy good health: <I><FONT color=brown>buxom</FONT></I> pioneer women. Both this use of the word and its use as a euphemism for fat have recently given way to its specific use for a sensual and, particularly, bosomy figure: a <I><FONT color=brown>buxom</FONT></I> barmaid.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chubby</FONT></B> suggests a squareness of figure, filled out with fleshiness, that might be thought earthy or robust: the <I><FONT color=brown>chubby</FONT></I> little girl; the <I><FONT color=brown>chubby</FONT></I> man’s twinkling eyes. The word sometimes has an aura of well-intended humour. <B><FONT color=blue>Adipose</FONT></B> is most strictly a biological term for fatty tissue itself.; when used as a substitute for fat, the word has comic effect, sometimes less well-intentioned than <I><FONT color=brown>chubby</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>adipose</FONT></I> ladies and gentlemen who rush in droves to reducing salons.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Healthy">HEALTHY</A>, <A href="entry://Husky">HUSKY</A>, <A href="entry://Large">LARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Massive">MASSIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: emaciated, <A href="entry://Thin">THIN</A>.</P>

fatal
<B><FONT color=blue>fatal</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>deadly</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lethal</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mortal</FONT></B>:

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Fatal</FONT></B> is used to describe anything that is capable of capable of causing or that actually has caused death; it carries a strong suggestion of the inevitability of fate: an illness which might not be serious for a young person, but which will almost certainly prove <I><FONT color=brown>fatal</FONT></I> to the old lady. <B><FONT color=blue>Deadly</FONT></B> is interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>fatal</FONT></I> in this sense: Leukaemia is a <I><FONT color=brown>deadly</FONT></I> disease. <I><FONT color=brown>Deadly</FONT></I>, however, in a way that <I><FONT color=brown>fatal</FONT></I> cannot, can refer to a person who desires or seek to cause the death of another person: The murdered man had many <I><FONT color=brown>deadly</FONT></I> enemies. <B><FONT color=blue>Mortal</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>deadly</FONT></I>, can be applied both to things or people that cause, are capable of causing, or seek to cause someone’s death: Because of an ancient family feud, the two cousins had been <I><FONT color=brown>mortal</FONT></I> enemies from birth. In its reference to things, <I><FONT color=brown>mortal</FONT></I> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>fatal</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>deadly</FONT></I> only in the fact that it is usually found in contexts which detail a death that has already occurred: He was struck down by a <I><FONT color=brown>mortal</FONT></I> blow upon the head. <B><FONT color=blue>Lethal</FONT></B> refers to something which, because of some intrinsic quality in its make-up is certain to cause death, and may indeed exist for the express purpose of causing death: Cyanide is a <I><FONT color=brown>lethal</FONT></I> poison.</P><P>With the exception of <I><FONT color=brown>lethal</FONT></I>, all these words can be used to describe something that causes great fear or discomfort, or that brings about disaster or ruin, but that does not lead to physical death: a <I><FONT color=brown>fatal</FONT></I> mistake; a <I><FONT color=brown>deadly</FONT></I> insult; in <I><FONT color=brown>mortal</FONT></I> terror.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dead">DEAD</A>, <A href="entry://Die">DIE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: enlivening, invigorating, life-giving.</P>

fault-finding
<B><FONT color=blue>fault-finding</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>captious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>carping</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cavilling</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>censorious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hypercritical</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>nit-picking</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pedantic</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the attitude or act of disapproval that consists in attacking weaknesses, imagined or real, in someone else or in his behaviour or achievements. <B><FONT color=blue>Fault-finding</FONT></B> is the most neutral of these words in that it can, conceivably, apply to a helpful or friendly ferreting out of actual weaknesses: giving his next-to-final draft to a friend who could always be counted on to be openly <I><FONT color=brown>fault-finding</FONT></I>. More often, it is true, the word suggests an eagerness to seek out weakness for its own sake, but even here the word is less severe in tone than the following words: certain that the inspecting officer would prove to be tediously <I><FONT color=brown>fault-finding</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hypercritical</FONT></B> suggests a harsher attitude than that suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>fault-finding</FONT></I>, pointing to someone over-eager to disparage, possibly out of a reluctance to recognize or honour the good qualities in others: views so <I><FONT color=brown>hypercritical</FONT></I> that his companion wondered what on earth could possibly meet with his approval. In further contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>fault-finding</FONT></I>, a <I><FONT color=brown>hypercritical</FONT></I> person need not necessarily dwell on weaknesses in something at all; he may simply reject it wholesale as obviously inferior. <B><FONT color=blue>Censorious</FONT></B> is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>hypercritical</FONT></I> in allowing the possibility of a blanket rejection. It is even harsher in tone, however, suggesting an attitude that is exclusively negative in its judgements. Someone who is <I><FONT color=brown>hypercritical</FONT></I> might be expected to spell out his views in some detail and to have, at least, standards for measurement; someone <I><FONT color=brown>censorious</FONT></I>, however, might merely express his negative evaluation without explanation or without having such standards. The word, furthermore, has overtones of prissy or priggish ill will: easy for the contemplative man to be <I><FONT color=brown>censorious</FONT></I> of every attempt at acting out an ideal.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Captious</FONT></B> suggests a further extreme than the foregoing words, but not so much towards a greater severity of judgement as towards a truly irresponsible or whimsical refusal to be pleased by the most meticulous effort. The word may suggest <I><FONT color=brown>fault-finding</FONT></I> that deliberately wishes to confuse rather to enlighten, especially when this results in fruitless argument: an interviewer who made <I><FONT color=brown>captious</FONT></I> remarks in order to get "interesting responses" from his subjects.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Carping</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cavilling</FONT></B> are better used to describe single acts of <I><FONT color=brown>fault-finding</FONT></I> rather than a <I><FONT color=brown>hypercritical</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>censorious</FONT></I> attitude. Both may suggest a zealous glee in scornfully condemning something on the basis of petty considerations or niggling faults; some difference between them can be seen, however, by noting that <I><FONT color=brown>cavilling</FONT></I> stems from words meaning jest, mock or raillery, and <I><FONT color=brown>carping</FONT></I> from words meaning dispute or boast. <I><FONT color=brown>Carping</FONT></I> best suggests a pedantic railing at or making a mockery of something for small failures; <I><FONT color=brown>cavilling</FONT></I> more often suggests strident or grating verbal attacks in which reasonable or generally acceptable propositions are imputed because of trivial lapses: a <I><FONT color=brown>carping</FONT></I> reviewer who though a few split infinitives more important than the whole range and sweep of the work; the prosecution’s <I><FONT color=brown>cavilling</FONT></I> rebuttal that seemed to see in the defendant’s nervous manner a proof of guilt.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Nit-picking</FONT></B> is a colourful and informal word that specifically stresses an excessive concern with small or trivial faults or with making distinctions so fine as to be pointless; this concern may be either well-intentioned, though misguided, or deliberately hostile: diplomats busy at their <I><FONT color=brown>nit-picking</FONT></I> while the whole world was going up in flames; an opponent who could find nothing wrong with my report and so had to content himself with <I><FONT color=brown>nit-picking</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Pedantic</FONT></B> is a word that is less directly related to the notion of disapproval. It emphasizes, instead, someone intent on needless displays of learning or petty points of scholarship: a <I><FONT color=brown>pedantic</FONT></I> dissertation, full of musty footnotes and gobbledygook. In the context of disapproval, it is more formal alternative for <I><FONT color=brown>nit-picking</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>pedantic</FONT></I> objections to practical proposals.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Disagree">DISAGREE</A>, <A href="entry://Disapproval">DISAPPROVAL</A>, <A href="entry://Spur">SPUR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: approving, commendatory, complimentary, encouraging, flattering, laudatory.</P>

<P>These words refer to the gaining of benefit or advantage or to the promise of such an outcome. <B><FONT color=blue>Favourable</FONT></B> can refer to a present situation that exposes one to positive possibilities: <I><FONT color=brown>favourable</FONT></I> influences absent from most slum schools. More simply, the word may refer to approval: <I><FONT color=brown>favourable</FONT></I> reviews of the play. Most pertinent here, the word pertains to signs that suggest an advantageous result: <I><FONT color=brown>favourable</FONT></I> indication that the share market would recover rapidly and reach new highs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Auspicious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>propitious</FONT></B> are restricted to this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>favourable</FONT></I>. Both suggest the foretelling of a beneficial outcome from preceding omens. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>auspicious</FONT></I> may better suggest an abundance of beneficial indications or conditions, <I><FONT color=brown>propitious</FONT></I> the absence of negative or deleterious ones: <I><FONT color=brown>auspicious</FONT></I> signs that victory would be theirs by nightfall; <I><FONT color=brown>propitious</FONT></I> weather that promised a calm voyage. In another context, <I><FONT color=brown>auspicious</FONT></I> may be used to indicate a clairvoyant telling of the future: She tended to see <I><FONT color=brown>auspicious</FONT></I> rather than ominous portents in her customers?tea leaves. <I><FONT color=brown>Propitious</FONT></I>, by contrast, is more commonly used to indicate the promise or gaining of more practical advantages: a business contract that seemed <I><FONT color=brown>propitious</FONT></I> to both parties.</P><P>Strictly speaking, <B><FONT color=blue>providential</FONT></B> is a heightening of the supernatural possibility inherent in <I><FONT color=brown>auspicious</FONT></I>, suggesting divine intervention to bring about a <I><FONT color=brown>favourable</FONT></I> outcome: They saw the breaking of the storm as a <I><FONT color=brown>providential</FONT></I> blessing on their mission. Often the force of the word is weakened to indicate anything that seems remarkably opportune: a <I><FONT color=brown>providential</FONT></I> escape from the avalanche. <B><FONT color=blue>Lucky</FONT></B> is a more informal synonyms for this last meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>providential</FONT></I>, carrying no implication in current use of any divine or supernatural intervention. The word, instead, refers to a chance occurrence that proves to be beneficial: the <I><FONT color=brown>lucky</FONT></I> accident by which they met. In a less precise use, the word can also refer to any positive circumstance, with less emphasis on chance: <I><FONT color=brown>lucky</FONT></I> to be living in a free country.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Good</FONT></B>, of course, is the least formal and, in its generality, the least precise of these words in referring to any positive circumstance: <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> results in the test. It can also refer to signs that augur a beneficial outcome: a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> prognosis. <B><FONT color=blue>Fortunate</FONT></B> may once have implied a <I><FONT color=brown>favourable</FONT></I> augury; more often, now, it indicates present success or <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> circumstances: contributions to those less <I><FONT color=brown>fortunate</FONT></I> than oneself. This implication even overshadows a use that relates to <I><FONT color=brown>lucky</FONT></I> in stressing, more formally, benefits that result form chance: a <I><FONT color=brown>fortunate</FONT></I> throw of the dice. One use of <B><FONT color=blue>happy</FONT></B> relates it to these words, suggesting advantages that result, not from chance, but from a discriminating choice of means that later events corroborate: Hiring him proved to be a <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I> decision. Sometimes, however, the word suggests fortuitous benefits, in which case the emphasis is on the beneficial outcome rather than, as with <I><FONT color=brown>lucky</FONT></I>, on the overcoming of odds: a <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I> accident.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Beneficial">BENEFICIAL</A>, <A href="entry://Opportune">OPPORTUNE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: adverse, bad, doomed, ill-fated, inauspicious, unfavourable, unlucky, untoward.</P>

<P>These words refer to seeking approval from others by praising them or behaving towards them in an obsequious or servile manner. <B><FONT color=blue>Fawn</FONT></B> can literally indicate the affectionate action of a dog towards his master, exhibited by licking him and sprawling before him, by tail-wagging and other forms of adoring behaviour. Servile behaviour of a comparable sort is suggested when a person acts in this way, although here the word becomes contemptuous, whether or not the obsequious display is sincere or undertaken cynically for self-advancement. [Only an uxorious husband could <I><FONT color=brown>fawn</FONT></I> on a woman the way he does; She <I><FONT color=brown>fawned</FONT></I> over her famous guests, but sneered at them when they were gone.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Truckle</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>crawl</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>toady</FONT></B> are harsher in their contempt than <I><FONT color=brown>fawn</FONT></I>, although less vivid and specific about the behaviour they point to. <I><FONT color=brown>Truckle</FONT></I> is very rare but once indicated any sort of servility, whether exhibited because of necessity, cowardice or self-interested obsequiousness: slaves who had to <I><FONT color=brown>truckle</FONT></I> to their harsh masters or be killed for insolence. <I><FONT color=brown>Toady</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>crawl</FONT></I> give no visual suggestions whatsoever about manner or bearing, but do specifically suggest the attempt to curry favour with one’s superiors by ingratiating behaviour: an actress who needed an entourage of lickspittles and lackeys to <I><FONT color=brown>toady</FONT></I> to her; the contemptible way in which he openly <I><FONT color=brown>crawls</FONT></I> to the boss. <I><FONT color=brown>Crawl</FONT></I> is becoming more common than <I><FONT color=brown>toady</FONT></I> and involves a wider range of ingratiating activity, including speech as well as actions.</P><P>The remaining words all emphasize verbal praise as the means of gaining approval. Of all these words, <B><FONT color=blue>compliment</FONT></B> alone can be used approvingly; the word can even indicate genuine admiration expressed for no ulterior motive: a teacher who was as ready to <I><FONT color=brown>compliment</FONT></I> deserving effort as she was to criticize slipshod work. But the word often applies to praise given insincerely as an empty formality or as a self-interested gesture; in this case, the tone of disapproval is much milder than that of any other word here. [He <I><FONT color=brown>complimented</FONT></I> her on her new dress without even looking at it; She refused to <I><FONT color=brown>complimented</FONT></I> the fatuous critic merely to win his approval.] <B><FONT color=blue>Flatter</FONT></B> concentrates exclusively on the paying of insincere <I><FONT color=brown>compliments</FONT></I> for whatever reason: She thought it could do no harm to <I><FONT color=brown>flatter</FONT></I> her escort a bit, at least on his tasted in wines; a film producer who expected to be <I><FONT color=brown>flattered</FONT></I> by the ambitious underlings who surrounded him. Sometimes the word can indicate a surprising but genuine interest that is taken by the recipient as a not wholly deserved honor: She <I><FONT color=brown>flattered</FONT></I> us by coming early and staying late; <I><FONT color=brown>flattered</FONT></I> by the sincerity of his concern for her.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Butter up</FONT></B> is an informal phrase that suggests not only the obsequious behaviour of <I><FONT color=brown>fawn</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>toady</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>crawl</FONT></I> but also the insincere praise indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>flatter</FONT></I>. The word adds to these implications completely cynical attitude behind the ingratiation acts and words and even a disrespectful or contemptuous attitude towards the person being courted: drop-outs who claim to detest their middle-class parents but know how to <I><FONT color=brown>butter</FONT></I> them <I><FONT color=brown>up</FONT></I> when the need arises.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Obsequious">OBSEQUIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: carp, condemn, criticize, dominate, insult, tyrannize.</P>

<P>These words refer to an upsetting emotional response to something unpleasant or dangerous. <B><FONT color=blue>Fear</FONT></B> is the most general of these and the least intense; it may suggest a mildly troubled emotion as well as more extreme states: her <I><FONT color=brown>fear</FONT></I> that the rain would damage her new shoes; his <I><FONT color=brown>fear</FONT></I> of facing the enemy’s mortar fire. It might also suggest mere timidity or, in another context, a vague state of psychological malaise: his <I><FONT color=brown>fear</FONT></I> of disagreeing with his boos; countless <I><FONT color=brown>fears</FONT></I> that leaped up whenever she had to face any new situation in life. <B><FONT color=blue>Fright</FONT></B> is more specific and more intense; it particularly suggests a sudden troubled reaction to some concrete external threat: filled with <I><FONT color=brown>fright</FONT></I> by the madman’s first lunge at her. The word can, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>fear</FONT></I>, have a slightly outmoded sound in some cases, especially because it has been used informally to describe anything ugly or unpleasant: a ball gown that was simply a <I><FONT color=brown>fright</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Alarm</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>panic</FONT></B> are words that may now sound more natural than <I><FONT color=brown>fright</FONT></I> in the context of a sudden external threat. <I><FONT color=brown>Alarm</FONT></I>, however, is almost as general as <I><FONT color=brown>fear</FONT></I> in extending from a mild uncertainty or uneasiness to intense and excited responses: his growing <I><FONT color=brown>alarm</FONT></I> at her lack of taste; the <I><FONT color=brown>alarm</FONT></I> that shone in his face as he saw the bridge begin to give way. When the word describes a more intense state, it suggests an initial response to danger, possibly in the instant when the danger is first recognized but before protective action can be taken: paralysed by <I><FONT color=brown>alarm</FONT></I> at the first news of the bombings. <I><FONT color=brown>Panic</FONT></I>, on the other hand, suggests the confused, hysterical actions that might follow the first feelings of alarm. It stresses ineffective action, especially of a group: the only one who did not lose his head in the general <I><FONT color=brown>panic</FONT></I> that filled the burning theatre. When the word is used of a single individual, action is not stressed so much as a disabling <I><FONT color=brown>fear</FONT></I>: He flailed the water helplessly in his sudden <I><FONT color=brown>panic</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Horror</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>terror</FONT></B> are closely related words that suggest an intense emotional upheaval at being confronted with something disgusting or dangerous. <I><FONT color=brown>Horror</FONT></I> stresses revulsion from the ugly or grotesque or from ethical depravity: They stood in <I><FONT color=brown>horror</FONT></I> at the unsanitary methods used to prepare their breakfast. It also suggests intense <I><FONT color=brown>fear</FONT></I>, possibly when the threat to one’s personal safety is unclear or absent: walking in <I><FONT color=brown>horror</FONT></I> through the snake room at the zoo; watching with <I><FONT color=brown>horror</FONT></I> as the tightrope walker struggled to regain his balance. <I><FONT color=brown>Terror</FONT></I> suggests a direct threat of personal danger; it is the most intense of all these words: He shook with <I><FONT color=brown>terror</FONT></I> as the door slammed shut and gas began to fill the room; huddled in <I><FONT color=brown>terror</FONT></I> along the walls of the air-raid shelter. When this pair of words refer to types of fiction, a fine distinction is often made between them. <I><FONT color=brown>Horror</FONT></I>, in this context, refers to a reliance on the grisly and macabre to gain a frightening effect: monsters, dungeons, open coffins ?all the trappings of the usual tale of <I><FONT color=brown>horror</FONT></I>. In contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>terror</FONT></I> suggests a story in which danger and suspense predominate, or one in which <I><FONT color=brown>fear</FONT></I> is called or disgusting: a tale of <I><FONT color=brown>terror</FONT></I> all the more chilling for being set in an ordinary living-room.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: calmness, <A href="entry://Courage">COURAGE</A>, equanimity.</P>

<P>These words refer to qualities that ideally or appropriately pertain to women. <B><FONT color=blue>Feminine</FONT></B> may carry a factual tone in indicating what pertains to women in general: the common <I><FONT color=brown>feminine</FONT></I> aversion towards violence in any form. The tone of the word changes drastically when it is used to evaluate the degree to which a woman possesses characteristics thought to be the ideal attainments of women; in this case it is strongly positive: a hostess unashamedly <I><FONT color=brown>feminine</FONT></I> in her ability to put people at ease. When applied to men, the word carries a negative tone: advertising campaigns that encourage men to take a rather <I><FONT color=brown>feminine</FONT></I> interest in after shave lotions and hair preparations; a man with an unfortunately <I><FONT color=brown>feminine</FONT></I> build.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Female</FONT></B> may be used in simple classification, applying to any species with sexual polarization: a <I><FONT color=brown>female</FONT></I> gorilla; magazines that complete for the <I><FONT color=brown>female</FONT></I> market. Outside of factual classification, the word sounds flatfootedly brusque, if not derogatory, and often carries an emphasis on distinctive biological functions: arguing that her fears were just to much <I><FONT color=brown>female</FONT></I> silliness; advertisements that are supposedly discreet in referring to "<I><FONT color=brown>female</FONT></I> troubles." By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>womanly</FONT></B> is wholly positive in restricting itself to desirable <I><FONT color=brown>feminine</FONT></I> qualities in women: dresses that showed off to advantage her lithe, <I><FONT color=brown>womanly</FONT></I> body. Changing cultural values have influenced the word: Victorians might have referred approvingly to a woman’s shyness or self-effacement as <I><FONT color=brown>womanly</FONT></I>. Now, by contrast, the word is often used with a new frankness to refer favourably to sexual attractiveness or capability in women: wives who are unafraid of expressing a natural and <I><FONT color=brown>womanly</FONT></I> desire for their husbands. Thus, the word is comparable not only to <I><FONT color=brown>manly</FONT></I>, but has expanded to compare as well with <I><FONT color=brown>virile</FONT></I> (for which no corresponding <I><FONT color=brown>female</FONT></I> term exists ?as though this area of concern were absent in women.)</P><P>The remaining words all tend towards the pejorative in their different ways. <B><FONT color=blue>Ladylike</FONT></B> was once wholly favourable and may still be so used: teaching the girls in her charge how to behave in <I><FONT color=brown>ladylike</FONT></I> fashion. More often now, however, the word indicates over-haughty or prissy behaviour in women: too <I><FONT color=brown>ladylike</FONT></I> to dream of working her way though university; career women who think it no betrayal of their <I><FONT color=brown>feminine</FONT></I> natures to dispense with any <I><FONT color=brown>ladylike</FONT></I> insistence on special treatment. The word is, of course, extremely derogatory in its rare use to describe a man’s behaviour: his comical, <I><FONT color=brown>ladylike</FONT></I> way of mincing at every step. <B><FONT color=blue>Womanish</FONT></B> applies disapprovingly to both men and women: his <I><FONT color=brown>womanish</FONT></I> habit of throwing up his hands whenever the office routine got the least bit hectic; breaking down into <I><FONT color=brown>womanish</FONT></I> fits of weeping at any imagined slight from her husband. <B><FONT color=blue>Effeminate</FONT></B>, by contrast, applies exclusively to men in a disapproving way; it may refer to physical or mental characteristics as well as behaviour, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>ladylike</FONT></I> in this context: a man with an <I><FONT color=brown>effeminate</FONT></I> physique; an <I><FONT color=brown>effeminate</FONT></I> lisp that made him difficult to listen to. <I><FONT color=brown>Feminine</FONT></I> in this context compares to <I><FONT color=brown>effeminate</FONT></I> by having a more factually descriptive tone: The longer, more <I><FONT color=brown>feminine</FONT></I> hair styles of male singers are no longer regarded as effeminate.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Masculine">MASCULINE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>novel</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fiction</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>romance</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>story</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to extended works of imaginative prose. <B><FONT color=blue>Novel</FONT></B> is the most specific and exact of these words, referring to any lengthy prose narrative that normally has a plot, characters, action and dialogue, but that does not refer to real people or events: best-selling novels; those who consider <I><FONT color=brown>Don Quixote</FONT></I> the first full-length <I><FONT color=brown>novel</FONT></I>. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>fiction</FONT></B> is more general since it is the group word for all forms of imaginative prose, including the short story, the novella and the <I><FONT color=brown>novel</FONT></I>. Since the <I><FONT color=brown>novel</FONT></I> is in one sense the most important form of <I><FONT color=brown>fiction</FONT></I>, the group word is often used with a special pertinence to this one form: a poor year for <I><FONT color=brown>fiction</FONT></I> in that no new major novel emerged.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Romance</FONT></B> is more difficult to pin down to an exact meaning. A related word in German is equivalent to our word <I><FONT color=brown>novel</FONT></I>, reflecting the development of the <I><FONT color=brown>novel</FONT></I> out of accounts of fabulous or legendary materials in the Middle Ages. In literary discussions, <I><FONT color=brown>romance</FONT></I> is often restricted to works showing works showing this emphasis on the fabulous or legendary, or it may be used more broadly to apply to <I><FONT color=brown>novels</FONT></I> with a strong mythic or allegorical bent: Malory’s gathering together and rewriting of the Arthurian <I><FONT color=brown>romances</FONT></I>; Hawthorne’s <I><FONT color=brown>novels</FONT></I> seen as being essentially <I><FONT color=brown>romances</FONT></I>. Contrary to a popular misconception, the word would never in any literary use refer merely to fiction that concerns itself with love affairs.</P><P>While <B><FONT color=blue>story</FONT></B> most commonly is an abbreviated way of referring to an established form, the short <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I>, it is sometimes used loosely and informally for any work of <I><FONT color=brown>fiction</FONT></I> with narrative thrust: novelists who concentrate on telling <I><FONT color=brown>stories</FONT></I> filled with physical violence. The word is also sometimes applied to the plot element of any <I><FONT color=brown>fiction</FONT></I>: a brief paragraph summarizing the <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> of the novel.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Composition">COMPOSITION</A>, <A href="entry://Narrative">NARRATIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Poetry">POETRY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: non-fiction.</P>

<P>These words all refer to the action that a liquid or gas undergoes in passing through another substance or medium. To <B><FONT color=blue>filter</FONT></B> means to pass (a liquid, air, etc.) through a porous substance such as paper or cloth, in order to extract certain impurities or essences. Papers folded into the shapes of cones and inserted in the mouths of test tubes or coffee-making devices are familiar uses of <I><FONT color=brown>filters</FONT></I>. Photographically, certain kinds of light or certain colours are <I><FONT color=brown>filtered</FONT></I> by mean so specifically coloured and constructed glass or plastic lens coverings.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Percolate</FONT></B> means to pass or cause to pass through fine opening or interstices. In coffee-making, as the hot water passes through a container of finely ground coffee, it extracts the essence of coffee and carries it along with it. <I><FONT color=brown>Percolate</FONT></I> emphasizes the process of passing through or permeating a substance; <I><FONT color=brown>filter</FONT></I> points to a particular means by which this process can take place. [Rainwater <I><FONT color=brown>percolates</FONT></I> through the soil to form an underground reservoir; To get red, you have to <I><FONT color=brown>filter</FONT></I> out the greens and blues; The spilt ink <I><FONT color=brown>filtered</FONT></I> through the blotter.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Exude</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>seep</FONT></B> mean to ooze or trickle out through pores or small openings. <I><FONT color=brown>Seep</FONT></I> suggests a gradual and often accidental or unwanted movement of a substance into or out of something. [Gas <I><FONT color=brown>seeped</FONT></I> into the room; Air <I><FONT color=brown>seeped</FONT></I> from the balloon; Blood <I><FONT color=brown>seeped</FONT></I> from his wound and reddened his bandages.] <I><FONT color=brown>Exude</FONT></I> is often used of natural or planned phenomena: to <I><FONT color=brown>exude</FONT></I> sweat; Gum <I><FONT color=brown>exuded</FONT></I> from the tree. It is also used figuratively with the sense of a powerful diffusion of any quality: to <I><FONT color=brown>exude</FONT></I> charm.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Leak">LEAK</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things impure, defiled, adulterated or layered with foreign matter. <B><FONT color=blue>Dirty</FONT></B> can refer to a lack of cleanliness that comes about through normal use: a pile of <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> clothes to be sent to the laundry. It can also suggest an unusual or more extreme cause: a dust storm that had left everything in the house <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I>. The word has more force in reference to impure morals: <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> stories; a <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> old man. <B><FONT color=blue>Soiled</FONT></B> concentrates mostly on things made <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> through normal use: a <I><FONT color=brown>soiled</FONT></I> apron; hands <I><FONT color=brown>soiled</FONT></I> from working in the garden. The word can suggest a layering over something with dirt or soil. In the moral context the word is even more forceful than dirty: a <I><FONT color=brown>soiled</FONT></I> reputation.</P><P>On the literal level, neither of the previous words need suggest disapproval for what may be a natural process. <B><FONT color=blue>Filthy</FONT></B>, however, suggests something extremely <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> and, possibly, disgusting or noxious: an unkempt tramp whose clothing was <I><FONT color=brown>filthy</FONT></I>. Morally the word serves as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> but the specific context is even more likely to be sexual in nature: lewd and <I><FONT color=brown>filthy</FONT></I> acts; pornography that included filthy pictures. <B><FONT color=blue>Squalid</FONT></B> adds to the implications of <I><FONT color=brown>filthy</FONT></I> a sense of disarray, disorder and distasteful rankness: <I><FONT color=brown>squalid</FONT></I> slums. In reference to morals the word suggests habits and patterns considerably outside the norm: hippies who live <I><FONT color=brown>squalid</FONT></I> fly-by-night lives.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Foul</FONT></B> now is largely restricted to what is morally reprehensible; its disapproval is vague, attaching to anything the user may deplore: a <I><FONT color=brown>foul</FONT></I> traitor. Language that includes so-called <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> words is often called <I><FONT color=brown>foul</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Unclean</FONT></B> can be used neutrally for anything soiled but oddly enough, it is particularly suggestive of a moral or religious context: <I><FONT color=brown>unclean</FONT></I> in mind and spirit. <B><FONT color=blue>Sordid</FONT></B>, more than any of the other words here, fuses together references to both physical and moral uncleanliness: <I><FONT color=brown>sordid</FONT></I> crimes committed in a <I><FONT color=brown>sordid</FONT></I> environment.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lewd">LEWD</A>, <A href="entry://Repulsive">REPULSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Vulgar">VULGAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clean">CLEAN</A>, pure, unsoiled, unsullied, virginal.</P>

final
<B><FONT color=blue>final</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>concluding</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>last</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ultimate</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all pertain to the end or conclusion of something that can be considered sequential. <B><FONT color=blue>Final</FONT></B> simply means coming at the end: <I><FONT color=brown>final</FONT></I> exams. It often carries a strong note, however, of decisiveness or conclusiveness: a <I><FONT color=brown>final</FONT></I> chance to buy a property before it was sold to someone else. <B><FONT color=blue>Last</FONT></B> means coming after all the others in a series, ie., <I><FONT color=brown>final</FONT></I> in order, sequence or time: the <I><FONT color=brown>last</FONT></I> page of a book; the <I><FONT color=brown>last</FONT></I> day of summer; He waited until the last minute before jumping on the train. <B><FONT color=blue>Concluding</FONT></B> means bringing to an end, and usually conveys the suggestion of a final settlement or arrangement. A <I><FONT color=brown>concluding</FONT></I> chapter brings the narrative or text of a book to a close; the <I><FONT color=brown>last</FONT></I> chapter is the one towards which all those before it have been leading. Because of the implicit suggestion within <I><FONT color=brown>final</FONT></I> of progression or of a series of related events having direction, the word is more often used in figurative expressions than either last or <I><FONT color=brown>concluding</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>final</FONT></I> chapter in a long and tempestuous career.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ultimate</FONT></B>, as here considered, means beyond which there is no other, and is denotatively synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>last</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>last</FONT></I>) stanza in a poem. <I><FONT color=brown>Ultimate</FONT></I> is, however, more formal in tone, and is often more emphatic in pointing to the <I><FONT color=brown>last</FONT></I> item in a series: his <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> offer for an out-of-court settlement before instituting legal action. While <I><FONT color=brown>last</FONT></I> states conveys strong feeling and determination, and is in this sense sometimes interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>final</FONT></I>: That is our <I><FONT color=brown>ultimate</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>final</FONT></I>) proposal, and no other changes will be considered.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conclusive">CONCLUSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Finish">FINISH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Beginning">BEGINNING</A>, first, initial, opening.</P>

<P>These words share the implication that something already in existence is being newly brought to light. <B><FONT color=blue>Find</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>discover</FONT></B> can both be used for an accidental or gratuitous gaining of knowledge; of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>find</FONT></I> is the less formal. [Explorers in Australia discovered flora and fauna found nowhere else in the world.] Both can, of course, be used to describe an intentional effort; <I><FONT color=brown>find</FONT></I> in this case may imply either a search for something new or the discovering of something lost but previously possessed. [He finally <I><FONT color=brown>found</FONT></I> the missing keys in a jacket he had put away for the summer; We know there must be a law that governs the odd gravitation behaviour of certain stars, but it may take us decades to <I><FONT color=brown>find</FONT></I> it.] <I><FONT color=brown>Discover</FONT></I>, when it implies an intentional search, always suggests the acquiring of something that already exists but is new to the discoverer: Mendel raised crop after crop of snapdragons to <I><FONT color=brown>discover</FONT></I> the laws governing heredity. It should be noted that this sense of <I><FONT color=brown>discover</FONT></I> contrasts sharply with invent, words often confused. [Gilbert <I><FONT color=brown>discovered</FONT></I> electricity, but Edison invented the electric light bulb.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Learn</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unearth</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>detect</FONT></B> are equally able to suggest either intentional or accidental discovery, although they tend more strongly towards the former. Of the three, <I><FONT color=brown>learn</FONT></I> is the most general and informal, detect the most specific and formal. <I><FONT color=brown>Learn</FONT></I> in one sense can imply a minimum of effort in gaining unsought knowledge: It was only today I happen to <I><FONT color=brown>learn</FONT></I> the name of the song I’d been whistling for year. But the weight of usage here is on conscious, painstaking effort towards a predetermined goal: A pianist <I><FONT color=brown>learns</FONT></I> the secret of a major work only by practising it intensively over a long period of time. <I><FONT color=brown>Unearth</FONT></I>, when referring to accidental discovery, implies the rediscovery of something lost or obscured by the passage of time: In his researches he was startled to <I><FONT color=brown>unearth</FONT></I> the manuscript of a major work by Boswell, never before published. Again, the suggestion of deliberate search is more frequently present, in which case digging deep into a subject is suggested: The prosecutor swore he would <I><FONT color=brown>unearth</FONT></I> the real facts in the case if he had to question everyone who had known the dead man. <I><FONT color=brown>Detect</FONT></I> is more rarely applicable to accidental discovery: To his surprise, he <I><FONT color=brown>detected</FONT></I> a bright red glow emanating from a crater in the moon. It most often suggests deliberate, deductive investigation and the making of extremely precise observations: Her pulse was so weak and erratic that the doctor could barely <I><FONT color=brown>detect</FONT></I> it. In one use, the word has a sharply negative sense that contrasts with a positive use of <I><FONT color=brown>discover</FONT></I>: It may take time for the public to <I><FONT color=brown>discover</FONT></I> your real worth as a writer, but fortunately the vapidity of the work has been quickly <I><FONT color=brown>detected</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Determine</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ascertain</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>locate</FONT></B> are almost exclusively suggestive of deliberate search and <I><FONT color=brown>discovery</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Determine</FONT></I>, in facts, is charged with the suggestion of painstaking conscious effort, especially to resolve a controversy. [From the facts presented, the coroner was able to <I><FONT color=brown>determine</FONT></I> conclusively that the death was not a suicide; No student may leave until he can <I><FONT color=brown>determine</FONT></I> the acidity or alkalinity of he chemical placed before him.] <I><FONT color=brown>Ascertain</FONT></I> implies that the searcher began with an awareness of his lack of knowledge on a given matter and worked to correct it; in this it is similar to but much more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>determine</FONT></I> ?even to the point of pomposity, except in very technical, legal or scientific writing. [We shall probably never be able to <I><FONT color=brown>ascertain</FONT></I> the exact nature of these sub-atomic particles; With careful research, it is possible to <I><FONT color=brown>ascertain</FONT></I> the often unspoken assumptions held by people of a particular historical era.] <I><FONT color=brown>Locate</FONT></I> is more specialized in meaning than either <I><FONT color=brown>determine</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>ascertain</FONT></I>, usually implying the fixing of an occurrence or thing in space. [All efforts have failed to <I><FONT color=brown>locate</FONT></I> decisively the birthplace of Columbus; From his directions, it shouldn’t be difficult to <I><FONT color=brown>locate</FONT></I> the beach house, even though you’ve never been there before.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Devise">DEVISE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Forget">FORGET</A>, <A href="entry://Mislay">MISLAY</A>, miss.</P>

<P>These words are alike in meaning to reach the end of a task or activity. <B><FONT color=blue>Finish</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>complete</FONT></B> mean to bring to an anticipated end by doing all things that are necessary or appropriate to achieving that end.

<B><FONT color=blue>flagrant</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>glaring</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gross</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rank</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to extreme, obvious or outrageous or offences. At its mildest, <B><FONT color=blue>flagrant</FONT></B> may be used to indicate what is deplorably obvious: <I><FONT color=brown>flagrant</FONT></I> indifference to the suffering of the poor. More commonly, however, the word is more emphatic in suggesting the public flaunting of blatant incompetence or impropriety: the proof-readers <I><FONT color=brown>flagrant</FONT></I> disregard of even the simplest errors; the <I><FONT color=brown>flagrant</FONT></I> cynicism of politicians who worked hand in glove with racketeers and gangsters. <B><FONT color=blue>Glaring</FONT></B> is even more emphatic about the obviousness of the failing, but is otherwise milder than <I><FONT color=brown>flagrant</FONT></I> in that it more often points to error, however inexcusable, than to unethical or immoral conduct: a play chockfull of <I><FONT color=brown>glaring</FONT></I> faults. The word might also suggest an annoyed rather than disgusted reaction: exasperated by his <I><FONT color=brown>glaring</FONT></I> bad manners. Occasionally, the word has the force of <I><FONT color=brown>flagrant</FONT></I>; even here, however, the misconduct that stands out is stressed: the <I><FONT color=brown>glaring</FONT></I> betrayal of a public trust.</P><P>With <B><FONT color=blue>gross</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rank</FONT></B>, the emphasis shifts from the obviousness of faults to their extreme or offensive nature. <I><FONT color=brown>Gross</FONT></I> is often used simply to mean extreme: <I><FONT color=brown>gross</FONT></I> unfairness. More precisely, the word suggests coarse or callous insensitivity to correct or decent standards of behaviour: <I><FONT color=brown>gross</FONT></I> mistreatment of a helpless child. Another reference of the word ?to heaviness ?is often implicated in this context, suggesting an almost immovable failing of great weight: an administration almost crippled by its won <I><FONT color=brown>gross</FONT></I> incompetence. <I><FONT color=brown>Gross</FONT></I> failings, however, need not be obvious: <I><FONT color=brown>gross</FONT></I> errors in the report that went completely unnoticed. <I><FONT color=brown>Rank</FONT></I> stresses disgusting offensiveness and tends to indicate moral corruption rather than simple error: the <I><FONT color=brown>rank</FONT></I> indecencies that occurred at the party. While the word does not necessarily suggest a public display, like <I><FONT color=brown>flagrant</FONT></I>, it does suggest corruption that would be obvious to anyone exposed to it: a book that brought the rank injustices of slavery to public attention. As with <I><FONT color=brown>gross</FONT></I>, other meanings of <I><FONT color=brown>rank</FONT></I> affect its shadings here, especially its references to things malodorous or overgrown: a <I><FONT color=brown>rank</FONT></I> system of pay-offs that should have reeked of foul play to any impartial investigator; a tangled bureaucracy filled with <I><FONT color=brown>rank</FONT></I> inefficiency.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clear">CLEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Definite">DEFINITE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Implicit">IMPLICIT</A>, mild, slight, venial.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>flaw</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>blemish</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>defect</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>failing</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fault</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>foible</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>imperfection</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mar</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>shortcoming</FONT></B>:

<P>These words indicate a lack in something that prevents it from being complete, wholly effective, or desirable. <B><FONT color=blue>Flaw</FONT></B> is the most general of these words, suggesting the existence or presence of something that spoils an otherwise sound entity: a <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> in his ingenious theory; an admirable character cursed by the tragic <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> of pride. While <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> suggests something that detracts from completeness, effectiveness or perfection, <B><FONT color=blue>fault</FONT></B> points to something that impairs excellence. A <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> can refer to something missing: The <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> in the weapon was its inability to fire rapidly. <I><FONT color=brown>Fault</FONT></I> usually refers to something present and to something inherent in the nature of a thing rather than external to it; <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> can refer to the superficial as well as to the profound. [The length of her white gloves was the only <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> in her appearance; a central <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> in his argument that invalidated his entire position; a <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>fault</FONT></I>) in the marble near the base of the statue; Snobbishness was his main <I><FONT color=brown>fault</FONT></I>.] In connection with character, <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> is somewhat more elegant and dramatic than the more prosaic <I><FONT color=brown>fault</FONT></I>.</P><P>While <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> may or may not indicate something easily removed or overcome, <B><FONT color=blue>defect</FONT></B> often suggests a <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> so serious as to completely prevent functioning: a <I><FONT color=brown>defect</FONT></I> in the fuel lines that prevented the missile from blasting off. Since it is now often used of machines, its application to human personality sometimes indicates a judgmental or simplistic view of human nature, suggesting easily traceable explanations for malfunction: probing for the <I><FONT color=brown>defect</FONT></I> that had made him resort to violence. In other contexts <I><FONT color=brown>defect</FONT></I> may refer to an error or the lack of something needed for completion. [A <I><FONT color=brown>defect</FONT></I> in judgement led to the accident; The <I><FONT color=brown>defect</FONT></I> in the microphone caused a humming sound.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mar</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>blemish</FONT></B> refer especially to marks or qualities that disfigure or make imperfect. <I><FONT color=brown>Blemish</FONT></I> applies particularly to <I><FONT color=brown>defects</FONT></I> of the skin: a facial <I><FONT color=brown>blemish</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Mar</FONT></I> is almost obsolete as a noun, but when used may refer to any slight <I><FONT color=brown>defect</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>mar</FONT></I> in the finish of a vase. Figurative use of <I><FONT color=brown>blemish</FONT></I> is quite common; the first <I><FONT color=brown>blemish</FONT></I> on an otherwise spotless record.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Imperfection</FONT></B> is closer to flaw than to defect in that it stresses malfunction less than incompleteness or lack of order: a slight <I><FONT color=brown>imperfection</FONT></I> in an otherwise beautiful design. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I>, however, points to a <I><FONT color=brown>blemish</FONT></I> that is self-evident, <I><FONT color=brown>imperfection</FONT></I> points more often to a lack that may be a matter of opinion. Like <I><FONT color=brown>defect</FONT></I>, the word also implies a pre-established canon by which to judge something: stylistic advances in his art that were regarded as <I><FONT color=brown>imperfections</FONT></I> by his contemporaries. And as <I><FONT color=brown>defect</FONT></I> relates to function, <I><FONT color=brown>imperfection</FONT></I> relates to form, drawing the former towards a scientific context, the latter to an artistic one. With <I><FONT color=brown>imperfection</FONT></I>, however, the judgement remains relative since no completely perfect thing exists.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Failing</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>shortcoming</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>foible</FONT></B> are the mildest of these words, suggesting a specific lapse in an otherwise sound entity. All three words most commonly related to personality, describing a characteristic way of behaving that is not desirable but does not vitiate goodness or overall effectiveness. <I><FONT color=brown>Foible</FONT></I> is perhaps the mildest of the three, suggesting a slight but ingrained eccentricity that may be easily recognized by others and allowed for without causing great difficulties. A <I><FONT color=brown>foible</FONT></I> may, in fact, be almost harmless and even endearing: a love that was strengthened rather than weakened by their acceptance of each other’s <I><FONT color=brown>foibles</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Failing</FONT></I> may suggest a more severe <I><FONT color=brown>shortcoming</FONT></I> that has more serious consequences: a lack of compassion that can be an insurmountable <I><FONT color=brown>failing</FONT></I> in either husband or wife. Sometimes the special point of the word is to indicate well-intentioned effort that does not succeed: the lack of convincing evidence that is the book’s main <I><FONT color=brown>failing</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Shortcoming</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>failing</FONT></I>, may refer to failures or deficiencies in things as well as people, and in this sense compares with one sense of <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I>: The weapon’s chief <I><FONT color=brown>shortcoming</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I>) was its inability to fire rapidly. When applied to personality or character, it is milder than either <I><FONT color=brown>flaw</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fault</FONT></I>, and is close to <I><FONT color=brown>failing</FONT></I> in meaning. [We all have our <I><FONT color=brown>shortcomings</FONT></I> ?that man dotes on his wife, this one flirts with other women, a third flies into jealous rages at the drop of a hat.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Characteristic">CHARACTERISTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Disfigure">DISFIGURE</A>, <A href="entry://Eccentricity">ECCENTRICITY</A>, <A href="entry://Lack">LACK</A>, <A href="entry://Mistake">MISTAKE</A>, <A href="entry://Sin">SIN</A>, <A href="entry://Stigma">STIGMA</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>flimsy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>frail</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>tenuous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unsubstantial</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to anything slight, weak, thin or sheer and thus either lacking in permanence or vulnerable to damage or criticism. <B><FONT color=blue>Flimsy</FONT></B> is the most general in embodying all these meanings, particularly emphasizing a lack of density that makes for limpness rather than rigidity: <I><FONT color=brown>flimsy</FONT></I> cloth that clung to the outlines of her body; a <I><FONT color=brown>flimsy</FONT></I> stalk that caused the flower to droop in its vase. Less concretely used, the word may refer to inferior materials, worthlessness, implausibility or low standards: <I><FONT color=brown>flimsy</FONT></I> books that come apart in your hands; the <I><FONT color=brown>flimsy</FONT></I> reporting of the local newspaper; a <I><FONT color=brown>flimsy</FONT></I> excuse; a <I><FONT color=brown>flimsy</FONT></I>, meretricious play. <B><FONT color=blue>Frail</FONT></B>, by contrast, concentrates more on slenderness, weakness or enfeeblement: furthermore, it need not suggest limpness: the <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> filaments used in light bulbs; the <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> teacup of bone china; a disease that left him <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> from loss of weight. <I><FONT color=brown>Flimsy</FONT></I> suggests, also, possible damage through tearing, <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> through breaking or shattering. Used more metaphorically, <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> does not function with the same intensity of disapproval felt in <I><FONT color=brown>flimsy</FONT></I>, although it can give a negative tone: a grasp of orchestration too <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> to give his symphonic ideas convincing weight. More often, however, the word can render a sharply contrasted connotation of pity: <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> hopes long ago shattered by the brutal facts of slum life.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>tenuous</FONT></B> can emphasize thinness, although in this case weakness is not necessarily involved: a heavy free-floating sculpture hung from <I><FONT color=brown>tenuous</FONT></I> wires that made it seem light and airy. The word’s particular relevance, however, is to haziness: a <I><FONT color=brown>tenuous</FONT></I> fog that threatened to thicken by morning. Related to this possibility is its more metaphorical suggestion of vagueness or confusion: ideas too <I><FONT color=brown>tenuous</FONT></I> to result in a realistic research project. Unsubstantial is the most formal of these words and emphasizes a lack of density, firmness, permanence or stability: building houses out of paper and other <I><FONT color=brown>unsubstantial</FONT></I> materials. Less specifically, the word points to something that is without basis in fact, cannot pass inspection, or that partakes of fancy or fantasy: <I><FONT color=brown>unsubstantial</FONT></I> theories; <I><FONT color=brown>unsubstantial</FONT></I> grounds for an appeal to a higher court; <I><FONT color=brown>unsubstantial</FONT></I> dreams of escaping her dreary existence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Translucent">TRANSLUCENT</A>, <A href="entry://Transparent">TRANSPARENT</A>, <A href="entry://Weak">WEAK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: firm, rugged, solid, sturdy, substantial, tough.</P>

flinch
<B><FONT color=blue>flinch</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cower</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cringe</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>grovel</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>wince</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to someone who shrinks from a person or action because of alarm, cowardice or servility. <I><FONT color=brown>Flinch</FONT></I> indicates an involuntary and startled drawing back in the course of performing an action. [<I><FONT color=brown>Flinching</FONT></I> from the anticipated report of the rifles is the most common cause of poor marksmanship; She <I><FONT color=brown>flinched</FONT></I> as the doctor inserted the needle in her arm.] At its most concrete, as in these examples, the word suggests a convulsed recoil or muscular spasm. The word can function more abstractly to refer to any psychological reluctance or avoidance: He <I><FONT color=brown>flinched</FONT></I> from thinking about the wife and children he had left behind. While <I><FONT color=brown>flinch</FONT></I> most often suggests alarm or fear as the cause of the recoil, <B><FONT color=blue>wince</FONT></B> points to pain or discomfort as the motivating factor. The recoiling action, furthermore, may be a slighter, briefer or less noticeable movement than that indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>flinch</FONT></I>: She gingerly touched her bruised shin and <I><FONT color=brown>winced</FONT></I> at the pain. The word can function less literally for any pained response: She <I><FONT color=brown>winced</FONT></I> and blinked under his withering attack. In this context, <I><FONT color=brown>flinch</FONT></I> better suggests initial aversion or reluctance, while <I><FONT color=brown>wince</FONT></I> is better suited to describing a discomfited response.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cringe</FONT></B> is more general than the preceding pair and can function in the place of either, referring to any recoil caused either by fear or pain. The action may not be so intense or sudden as those of <I><FONT color=brown>flinch</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>wince</FONT></I>, but it may be longer-lasting: left standing by the rail to <I><FONT color=brown>cringe</FONT></I> under a steady onslaught of see spray. Also, spasmodic movement is not suggested here so much as a crouched or stooped posture. This is especially true when the word refers to servile, cowardly or obsequious behaviour: slaves who <I><FONT color=brown>cringed</FONT></I> under the wrath of their master; a candidate who <I><FONT color=brown>cringed</FONT></I> from direct confrontation with his opponent; disgusted by the way he <I><FONT color=brown>cringed</FONT></I> and fawned before his teacher in rapt self-abasement.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cower</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>grovel</FONT></B> both relate more closely to cringe than to the first pair of words, emphasizing stooped or sprawled postures adopted out of fear, servility or obsequiousness. <I><FONT color=brown>Cower</FONT></I>, however, can also indicate a fearful and trembling recoil or drawing back from danger, pain or extreme discomfort: He <I><FONT color=brown>cowered</FONT></I> in frozen panic as the horses stampeded towards him; oarsmen who <I><FONT color=brown>cowered</FONT></I> and groaned at each fall of the lash. In reference to obsequiousness, <I><FONT color=brown>cower</FONT></I> is now more specific, vivid and disapproving than <I><FONT color=brown>cringe</FONT></I>, indicating someone who seeks approval by an extreme display of deferential humility: the sanctimonious remorse with which he <I><FONT color=brown>cowered</FONT></I> before the judge in hope of winning a lighter sentence. <I><FONT color=brown>Grovel</FONT></I> is the most extreme of all the words in any of the situations possible for this group; it specifically points to a sprawled or prone position, suggesting abject and incapacitating fear, loathsome servility or self abasing adoration: choked with sobs and <I><FONT color=brown>grovelling</FONT></I> on the floor in terror as the two men fought over her; those who hope to influence policy by <I><FONT color=brown>grovelling</FONT></I> before the policy-makers and flattering their sense of self-importance; He worshipped is wife so much that no amount of <I><FONT color=brown>grovelling</FONT></I> seemed adequate to express his utter surrender to her.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>, <A href="entry://Demur">DEMUR</A>, <A href="entry://Fawn">FAWN</A>, <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: brazen out, carry off, confront, face.</P>

<P>These words are all used to describe particular kinds of attitudes, speech and behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Flippant</FONT></B> (with its U.S. colloquial form <B><FONT color=blue>flip</FONT></B>) and <B><FONT color=blue>fresh</FONT></B> are always unfavourable in connotation. They imply impertinence or lack of respect; <I><FONT color=brown>flippant</FONT></I> also indicates an inappropriate levity in the face of something serious. The three can describe attitudes and actions, but very often relate to speech or writing. [It is a <I><FONT color=brown>flippant</FONT></I> editorial, not at all in keeping with the importance of its theme; He was <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I> when he was a child, and his manners have not improved with age.]</P><P>Unlike the foregoing words, <B><FONT color=blue>casual</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>nonchalant</FONT></B> can be neutral or even complimentary in tone. Both words indicate a lack of concern, interest or excitement: a <I><FONT color=brown>casual</FONT></I> air; a <I><FONT color=brown>nonchalant</FONT></I> approach to business problems. <I><FONT color=brown>Nonchalant</FONT></I>, however, may suggest an attempt to be disciplined or detached: Throughout the meeting, he maintained his <I><FONT color=brown>nonchalant</FONT></I> manner, even when the shouting and arguing were at their height.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Smart</FONT></B> is close in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>flippant</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I>. However, since other senses of <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I> relate to the possession of intelligence or wisdom, there is sometimes a suggestion of those qualities present even when the word is used in criticism or disparagement. The intelligence and wisdom hinted at are perverted by arrogance or a nasty wit, but they can make the distinction between someone being <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I> and being <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I>: She was a good editor, but she kept making <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I> remarks to the department head and he finally had to dismiss her. When <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I> is used in reference to a child, it describes someone who is unpleasantly assertive or forward. [The little boy was so <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I> to his mother that she sent him to bed without any tea.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Contemptuous">CONTEMPTUOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Sarcastic">SARCASTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Uninvolved">UNINVOLVED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Polite">POLITE</A>, serious, solemn.</P>

flood
<B><FONT color=blue>flood</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>deluge</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>engulf</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inundate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>overwhelm</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>swamp</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>whelm</FONT></B>:

<P>These verbs mean to cover with water or other liquid, as by a downpour, wave or overflow. <B><FONT color=blue>Flood</FONT></B> is the most general word. It indicates the submergence of something that is not normally under water: A leak in the plumbing <I><FONT color=brown>flooded</FONT></I> the bathroom. The noun <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I>, in its commonest meaning, refers to an overflowing of dry land by water, as when heavy, concentrated rainfall fills a stream beyond capacity. Hence the verb <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I> means to fill, overflow, drench or submerge with water. [During spring rains the river <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I>; The river <I><FONT color=brown>flooded</FONT></I> extensive areas of the countryside; A calamitous storm tide <I><FONT color=brown>flooded</FONT></I> the coast; The cyclone <I><FONT color=brown>flooded</FONT></I> the beach cottage and did considerable water damage.] Figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I> may refer to anything that seems to move in a full stream: Sunlight <I><FONT color=brown>flooded</FONT></I> the room. Or it may mean to supply with an excess or abundance of anything: to <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I> an engine with petrol; They <I><FONT color=brown>flooded</FONT></I> him with advice.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Flood</FONT></I> comes from an Old English word. Its collateral adjective, diluvial and its closest synonym, <B><FONT color=blue>deluge</FONT></B>, derive from the Latin word for <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Deluge</FONT></I> may designate a world-wide <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I>, or one covering a considerable part of the earth’s surface. Specifically, it applies to the rain of forty days and forty nights in the time of Noah ?a cataclysm called either <I><FONT color=brown>the Deluge</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>the Flood</FONT></I>. In general use, however, where <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I> focus on the rising flow of water in a swollen stream, <I><FONT color=brown>deluge</FONT></I> stresses the idea of an unremitting downpour. In a literal sense, the verb <I><FONT color=brown>deluge</FONT></I> may imply a drenching with torrents of water: Heavy monsoon rain <I><FONT color=brown>deluged</FONT></I> southern India, <I><FONT color=brown>flooding</FONT></I> the rivers. But the verb is most often used in a figurative sense, indicating any kind of profuse downpour or incessant stream: a candidate <I><FONT color=brown>deluged</FONT></I> with telegrams from well-wishers; an author <I><FONT color=brown>deluged</FONT></I> with offers of honorary degrees.</P><P>The verb <B><FONT color=blue>inundate</FONT></B> is synonymous with flood but is far more literary. <I><FONT color=brown>Inundate</FONT></I> goes back in derivation to the Latin word for wave. It is close to <I><FONT color=brown>deluge</FONT></I> in force and meaning, but it differs in its emphasis on a wave-like overflow. To inundate is to overrun with water and cover completely. [If the dikes of the Netherlands gave way, the sea would <I><FONT color=brown>inundate</FONT></I> the lowlands; A submarine earthquake caused a tidal wave that <I><FONT color=brown>inundated</FONT></I> the peninsula.] In a figurative sense, <I><FONT color=brown>inundate</FONT></I> points to an overflowing abundance: a bookstore <I><FONT color=brown>inundated</FONT></I> with orders for a best-seller; a letterbox <I><FONT color=brown>inundated</FONT></I> with circulars; an M.P. <I><FONT color=brown>inundated</FONT></I> by requests from this constituents. <I><FONT color=brown>Inundate</FONT></I> may also mean to overpower like an onrushing wave: The work piled up and threatened to <I><FONT color=brown>inundate</FONT></I> him.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Swamp</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>inundate</FONT></I> but is much more informal. Literally, it means to drench or submerge: The swollen river <I><FONT color=brown>swamped</FONT></I> scores of villages during the <I><FONT color=brown>flood</FONT></I>. To <I><FONT color=brown>swamp</FONT></I> a boat is to sink it by filling it with water: the canoe was nearly <I><FONT color=brown>swamped</FONT></I> by the waves. In a colloquial sense, <I><FONT color=brown>swamp</FONT></I> means to overburden with an unmanageable number or amount of anything: a university <I><FONT color=brown>swamped</FONT></I> with applications; I’m <I><FONT color=brown>swamped</FONT></I> with work. <I><FONT color=brown>Swamp</FONT></I> may also suggest utter defeat or a thoroughgoing rout: The home team <I><FONT color=brown>swamped</FONT></I> the opposition.</P><P>Where <I><FONT color=brown>inundate</FONT></I> implies standing water covering a surface, <B><FONT color=blue>overwhelm</FONT></B> may suggest liquid going over and under, around and through. <I><FONT color=brown>Overwhelm</FONT></I> comes from a Middle English word meaning to turn upside down. It calls to mind the overpowering force of a mighty wave that rolls over and buries everything in its path: Streams of lava <I><FONT color=brown>overwhelmed</FONT></I> the village at the foot of the volcano; a lost continent <I><FONT color=brown>overwhelmed</FONT></I> by the sea. <I><FONT color=brown>Overwhelm</FONT></I> is now more commonly used in figurative senses, often referring to abstractions: <I><FONT color=brown>overwhelmed</FONT></I> by grief; His foolhardy accusations opened the floodgates of suspicion, and unreason <I><FONT color=brown>overwhelmed</FONT></I> the land. <B><FONT color=blue>Whelm</FONT></B> is very close to <I><FONT color=brown>overwhelm</FONT></I> but sometimes conveys a greater sense of foreboding. It suggests a being enveloped on all sides by water or by something that covers and suffocates like water: A dust storm whelmed the wagon train; a town <I><FONT color=brown>whelmed</FONT></I> by an earthquake. <I><FONT color=brown>Whelm</FONT></I> is used with telling force by Gerard Manley Kopkins in <I><FONT color=brown>Spelt from Sibyl’s Leaves</FONT></I>: "Our evening is over us; our night <I><FONT color=brown>whelms</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>whelms</FONT></I>, and will end us." <B><FONT color=blue>Engulf</FONT></B> means to swallow up, as in an abyss or bottomless gulf. It suggests a being utterly overwhelmed by waters ?enveloped and buried beyond any hope of escape: The legendary island of Atlantis was <I><FONT color=brown>engulfed</FONT></I> by the sea and disappeared without a trace.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Marsh">MARSH</A>, <A href="entry://Vanquish">VANQUISH</A>, <A href="entry://Wet">WET</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the movement of fluids or a mass of particles. <B><FONT color=blue>Flow</FONT></B> indicates continuous and free movement, and often suggests slow, steady and untroubled passage: the broad river that <I><FONT color=brown>flowed</FONT></I> through my home town; the prevailing air current that <I><FONT color=brown>flows</FONT></I> from west to east; salt that gets damp and refuses to <I><FONT color=brown>flow</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Flow</FONT></I> can have a lyrical tone: We watched the river as it <I><FONT color=brown>flowed</FONT></I> on under the bridge. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>run</FONT></B> is more matter-of-fact, although it is usually restricted to the movement of liquids. In this context, it is very general, suggesting any amount, channelled or unchannelled, moving in any direction: water <I><FONT color=brown>running</FONT></I> down the windscreen; In which direction does the river <I><FONT color=brown>run</FONT></I>? In reference to streams or rivers, <I><FONT color=brown>run</FONT></I> may suggest faster movement than <I><FONT color=brown>flow</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pour</FONT></B> most often suggests sharp downward movement: soot <I><FONT color=brown>poured</FONT></I> out over the city; water <I><FONT color=brown>pouring</FONT></I> over the dam. <B><FONT color=blue>Stream</FONT></B> can also apply to a movement both of fluids and of particles, but is otherwise like <I><FONT color=brown>run</FONT></I> in suggesting any amount moving in any direction. It usually suggests more rapid or more forceful movement, however: tears <I><FONT color=brown>streaming</FONT></I> down her face; smoke <I><FONT color=brown>streaming</FONT></I> from the chimney. As in the last example, movement in a narrow band or through a small aperture is often implied: water <I><FONT color=brown>streaming</FONT></I> through the irrigation ditches: cars <I><FONT color=brown>streaming</FONT></I> over the bridge.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gush</FONT></B> suggests surging, turbulent or sudden movement, whether in a general upwelling or a rapid jet: blood <I><FONT color=brown>gushing</FONT></I> from his head; water <I><FONT color=brown>gushing</FONT></I> in a fine spray from the fountains. <B><FONT color=blue>Spout</FONT></B> more strictly refers to a continuous or intermittent jet: waster <I><FONT color=brown>spouting</FONT></I> from the leaky pipe; Badly wounded, the whale began to <I><FONT color=brown>spout</FONT></I> blood.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Spurt</FONT></B> can suggest small or intermittent jets: He squeezed the plunger of the hypodermic until the needle <I><FONT color=brown>spurted</FONT></I> out a few drops. <B><FONT color=blue>Squirt</FONT></B>, when distinct from <I><FONT color=brown>spurt</FONT></I>, may suggest a wider or more diffuse spray: water <I><FONT color=brown>squirting</FONT></I> from the fire hose.

<B><FONT color=blue>foggy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cloudy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>murky</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>opaque</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>turbid</FONT></B>:

<P>All these words apply to what is obscure and confused or shows a lack of clarity. Even when used in an abstract way, the closely related <B><FONT color=blue>foggy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cloudy</FONT></B> can sometimes allude to distinctions between a fog and a cloud. The former is low-lying, enveloping, diffuse, and indefinite in configuration; the latter, partly because it is usually seen from a distance, is typically thought of as being a denser, more remote, and more clearly defined mass that may affect but does not impinge upon the viewer. Similarly, <I><FONT color=brown>foggy</FONT></I> can refer to an enveloping obscurity or confusion in a thinker’s mind: <I><FONT color=brown>foggy</FONT></I> generalizations without any substantiation in fact. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>cloudy</FONT></I> can suggest remoteness, lack of relevance, or uncertainty that is external to the thinker or speaker: The prospect for passage of the bill was somewhat <I><FONT color=brown>cloudy</FONT></I>, in view of its evident unconstitutionality. As in this example, the word often refers to a future outcome; <I><FONT color=brown>foggy</FONT></I> is more apt for present confusion: <I><FONT color=brown>cloudy</FONT></I> eventualities; I haven’t the <I><FONT color=brown>foggiest</FONT></I> notion what you're talking about. Both, of course, can serve as literal description: a <I><FONT color=brown>foggy</FONT></I> day; a <I><FONT color=brown>cloudy</FONT></I> day. <I><FONT color=brown>Cloudy</FONT></I> can also be used to describe milky or unclear liquids: <I><FONT color=brown>cloudy</FONT></I> tap water that clears after a few minutes.</P><P>Literally, <B><FONT color=blue>turbid</FONT></B> means muddy or unsettled, and applies particularly to suspensions of foreign particles within a liquid, such as particles of dirt in water. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>cloudy</FONT></I> in this sense emphasizes a misty appearance, <I><FONT color=brown>turbid</FONT></I> stresses the presence of foreign material that pollutes, muddies or unsettles the basic medium. <I><FONT color=brown>Turbid</FONT></I>, however, is probably more commonly used in figurative than literal senses. It may mean thick and dense, like heavy smoke or fog: a <I><FONT color=brown>turbid</FONT></I> smoke screen of deceitful hints and outright lies. It may mean confused or impure, suggesting a chaotic intermixture of incompatible elements: The stream-of-consciousness technique in fiction has been likened to a <I><FONT color=brown>turbid</FONT></I> confluence of fact, passion and ratiocination.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Murky</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>opaque</FONT></B> suggest lack of light. <I><FONT color=brown>Murky</FONT></I> can mean oppressively dark or, by extension, unclear and confused, as if seen through a mist. <I><FONT color=brown>Opaque</FONT></I>, which in its basic sense means impervious to light, suggests denseness and relative impenetrability: <I><FONT color=brown>opaque</FONT></I> writing, filled with erudite but inept allusions; a <I><FONT color=brown>murky</FONT></I> exegesis of an arcane work, full of dark, involuted clues to which only the author has the key.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Obscure">OBSCURE</A>, <A href="entry://Translucent">TRANSLUCENT</A>, <A href="entry://Vague">VAGUE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bright, <A href="entry://Clear">CLEAR</A>, sunny, <A href="entry://Transparent">TRANSPARENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words function as both nouns and verbs and apply to marks, grooves, ridges or furrows made in a smooth surface. To <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> something is to bend it over upon itself so that one part covers another: to <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> a blanket; to <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> a newspaper; to <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> up a road map; Do not <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I>, spike or mutilate. Used intransitively, the verb <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> means to close together with the parts touching or facing: A fan <I><FONT color=brown>folds</FONT></I>. The noun <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> may designate a <I><FONT color=brown>folded</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>folding</FONT></I> part, piece or layer: the <I><FONT color=brown>folds</FONT></I> of the bellows of an accordion. The eyelid is a movable <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> of skin that smooths out when lowered over the eye. A double chin is a fatty <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> of flesh under the chin. <I><FONT color=brown>Fold</FONT></I> may also apply to a mark made by <I><FONT color=brown>folding</FONT></I> or the hollow between two <I><FONT color=brown>folded</FONT></I> parts: to tear paper evenly along a <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I>; He enveloped her in the voluminous <I><FONT color=brown>folds</FONT></I> of his cloak.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>line</FONT></B> is a long, straight, slender mark, as one crossing the brow: the <I><FONT color=brown>lines</FONT></I> in her pale, drawn face; a forehead <I><FONT color=brown>lined</FONT></I> by care. The <I><FONT color=brown>lines</FONT></I> in the palm of the hand indicate the flexional <I><FONT color=brown>folds</FONT></I> of the skin which make firm grasping possible. Palmists claim that the so-called life <I><FONT color=brown>line</FONT></I>, head <I><FONT color=brown>line</FONT></I> and heart line are indicative of a person’s fortune. A crease is a mark, ridge or furrow made by <I><FONT color=brown>folding</FONT></I>. Like a <I><FONT color=brown>line</FONT></I>, a <B><FONT color=blue>crease</FONT></B> may indicate the place where something <I><FONT color=brown>folds</FONT></I>; but a <I><FONT color=brown>crease</FONT></I> is usually considered to be heavier than a <I><FONT color=brown>line</FONT></I> though shallower than a <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I>. Hence, when the hand is slowly closed, the <I><FONT color=brown>lines</FONT></I> in the palm first deepen into <I><FONT color=brown>creases</FONT></I>, then thicken into <I><FONT color=brown>folds</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Crease</FONT></I> is also used of heavy lines about the mouth or eyes or on the forehead: A sullen scowl <I><FONT color=brown>creased</FONT></I> his brow. And it may indicate a <I><FONT color=brown>line</FONT></I> of soreness or tension that results from bending or twisting: The lumpy mattress put a painful <I><FONT color=brown>crease</FONT></I> in his back.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>wrinkle</FONT></B> is a small <I><FONT color=brown>line</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>crease</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> in a smooth surface, as a furrow made in the forehead by raising the eyebrows. To <I><FONT color=brown>wrinkle</FONT></I> is to contract into alternate ridges and furrows: He <I><FONT color=brown>wrinkled</FONT></I> his brow in concentration. Permanent <I><FONT color=brown>wrinkles</FONT></I> in the skin may result from age, anxiety or excessive exposure to the elements: a <I><FONT color=brown>wrinkled</FONT></I> crone. Applied to fabric, <I><FONT color=brown>wrinkle</FONT></I> indicates a temporary mark made by crushing or rumpling. The verbs <I><FONT color=brown>wrinkle</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>crease</FONT></I> are synonymous in this sense: Linen <I><FONT color=brown>wrinkles</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>creases</FONT></I>) easily. The noun <I><FONT color=brown>crease</FONT></I>, however, may indicate a deliberate or permanent line, as one of the two sharp edges pressed into men’s trouser legs. In reference to materials, <B><FONT color=blue>crimp</FONT></B> is also rather like <I><FONT color=brown>wrinkle</FONT></I>, but has the sense of deliberate compressing into tiny <I><FONT color=brown>folds</FONT></I>: The dress was beautifully <I><FONT color=brown>crimped</FONT></I> across the bodice. Skin and hair are said to be <I><FONT color=brown>crimped</FONT></I> if in small tight <I><FONT color=brown>folds</FONT></I> or curls. A <B><FONT color=blue>pleat</FONT></B> is a <I><FONT color=brown>fold</FONT></I> of cloth doubled on itself and pressed or sewn in place: a kick <I><FONT color=brown>pleat</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>pleated</FONT></I> draperies; a <I><FONT color=brown>pleated</FONT></I> skirt. <I><FONT color=brown>Pleat</FONT></I> may also indicate the way a thing is <I><FONT color=brown>creased</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>folded</FONT></I>: an accordion <I><FONT color=brown>pleat</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Crack">CRACK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: smooth, straighten, unfold.</P>

<P>These words refer to ethnic groups or subcultures that can be identified by specific acts or shared traits, whether physical or cultural. <B><FONT color=blue>Folk</FONT></B> is the most vague of these words and applies better to periods of history before the Industrial Revolution. It refers to the common people or peasants of those eras and is based on a class rather than an ethnic distinction. It would, in any case, be rarely used except as a combining form, referring to the products of this class of people: <I><FONT color=brown>folk</FONT></I> music, <I><FONT color=brown>folk</FONT></I> culture, <I><FONT color=brown>folk</FONT></I> tales. It has a modern informal use to refer to one’s nearest relatives or the community in which one may have grown up: the <I><FONT color=brown>folks</FONT></I> back home; I write regularly to my <I><FONT color=brown>folks</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Nation</FONT></B> can, of course, refer to any government, ancient or modern, but in this context it refers more particularly to nomadic groups that maintain a common culture, despite their being widely scattered: the gypsy <I><FONT color=brown>nation</FONT></I>; the Red Indian <I><FONT color=brown>nations</FONT></I> of North America; the Jewish <I><FONT color=brown>nation</FONT></I> that somehow survived despite its scattering during the Diaspora. <B><FONT color=blue>People</FONT></B> is a less confusing term to describe a group, whether scattered or not, that share a common ethnic and cultural background: a <I><FONT color=brown>people</FONT></I> as conscious of individual liberty as the Greeks; the <I><FONT color=brown>peoples</FONT></I> of the earth, each with a distinctive contribution to make towards defining mankind. <I><FONT color=brown>People</FONT></I> is used also in the sense of one’s family and is more common than <I><FONT color=brown>folk</FONT></I> in this respect: My <I><FONT color=brown>people</FONT></I> were all on the land. <B><FONT color=blue>Tribe</FONT></B> is more specific than <I><FONT color=brown>people</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>nation</FONT></I> in referring exclusively to a closely-knit primitive culture group: the <I><FONT color=brown>tribes</FONT></I> of Africa and the Pacific.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Race</FONT></B> refers to those large divisions of humans into physical types that are determined solely by some combination of skin colour, facial characteristics and other imponderables. Physical anthropologists have concluded that all such attempts to define clear-cut <I><FONT color=brown>races</FONT></I> are inexact, subjective and unscientific: the Caucasian or white <I><FONT color=brown>race</FONT></I>; the Negro <I><FONT color=brown>race</FONT></I>; the Oriental <I><FONT color=brown>races</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Kin">KIN</A>, <A href="entry://Mankind">MANKIND</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to moving in the path of someone who has gone before. <B><FONT color=blue>Follow</FONT></B> is the most neutral of these, yielding the fewest overtones. The gap between leader and <I><FONT color=brown>follower</FONT></I> may be slight or great; the motives for <I><FONT color=brown>following</FONT></I> may range from admiring emulation to a desire to catch or kill the leader: soldiers who <I><FONT color=brown>followed</FONT></I> the platoon leader in single file at the interval of a few paces; an expedition to <I><FONT color=brown>follow</FONT></I> the path that Alexander must have taken to the Indian subcontinent centuries before; She <I><FONT color=brown>followed</FONT></I> after him with cries for help; armed detectives <I><FONT color=brown>following</FONT></I> the rout taken by the escaped convict.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shadow</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tail</FONT></B> are both extremely informal words that restrict themselves to the act of following out of unfriendly motives; they also suggest a wish to remain unobserved but to stay close to the person being <I><FONT color=brown>followed</FONT></I>. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>shadow</FONT></I> suggests a more relentless and short-range action: He assigned a plainclothes man to <I><FONT color=brown>shadow</FONT></I> the woman every second of the day. <I><FONT color=brown>Tail</FONT></I> may suggest a briefer involvement, one at a greater distance: <I><FONT color=brown>tailing</FONT></I> the truck until it had driven beyond the outer suburbs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chase</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pursue</FONT></B> both suggest swiftness or determination: police who commandeered a passing car to <I><FONT color=brown>chase</FONT></I> a escaping thieves. <I><FONT color=brown>Chase</FONT></I> may also suggest the actual driving away of an enemy: She <I><FONT color=brown>chased</FONT></I> the hooligans from her yard. But while <I><FONT color=brown>chase</FONT></I> often suggests unfriendliness, the act may also be done out of sportiveness or high spirits: The boy <I><FONT color=brown>chased</FONT></I> his playmate round the block. It may also suggest an eager, desiring search: a man who <I><FONT color=brown>chased</FONT></I> after women all his life. <I><FONT color=brown>Pursue</FONT></I>, except for its overtones of speed and determination, is almost as devoid of overtones as <I><FONT color=brown>follow</FONT></I>. No situation or motive is necessarily suggested by the word in itself: detectives who <I><FONT color=brown>purused</FONT></I> the murderer through miles of thick scrub; She <I><FONT color=brown>purused</FONT></I> the absent-minded man to give him back the briefcase he had left behind.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tag</FONT></B> suggests close surveillance, either secretively or with the leader’s full knowledge. In the situation of secrecy, the word approaches the meanings suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>shadow</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>tail</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>tagging</FONT></I> the man to find out where he lived. In the situation of acknowledge pursuit, the word may suggest the admiring imitation of someone thought of as a model or superior: the child who <I><FONT color=brown>tagged</FONT></I> after his older brother wherever he went.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Trail</FONT></B> may suggest a laggard and spiritless <I><FONT color=brown>following</FONT></I> after someone else: hikers who <I><FONT color=brown>trailed</FONT></I> into camp hours after the first ones had arrived. More often it refers to a stealthy <I><FONT color=brown>pursuing</FONT></I> of someone after he has gone on his way, an action that is done by seeking clues as to which way he might have taken: black trackers expert at <I><FONT color=brown>trailing</FONT></I> someone with a day’s start; They used dogs to <I><FONT color=brown>trail</FONT></I> the escaped convicts. When the word pertains to a closer <I><FONT color=brown>following</FONT></I>, it approaches the meaning suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>tail</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>pursue</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hunt">HUNT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: lead, precede.</P>

<P>These words pertain to someone who does not belong, either at all or as yet, to the group in which he finds himself. <B><FONT color=blue>Foreigner</FONT></B> specifically indicates that someone is a native or citizen of a nation other than the one he is now living in or visiting. The word can theoretically be used in neutral description, but in the past it was so often used to express suspicion or disapproval that it is difficult to avoid this tone completely even in the most innocent use: the <I><FONT color=brown>foreigners</FONT></I> who moved in across the street from us. A <I><FONT color=brown>foreigner</FONT></I> who intends to remain permanently in his new country can be more neutrally referred to as an <B><FONT color=blue>immigrant</FONT></B>. Although this word, too, could once be used pejoratively, its use as a precise legal term has kept it more viable and neutral than <I><FONT color=brown>foreigner</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>immigrant’s</FONT></I> visa. Until an <I><FONT color=brown>immigrant</FONT></I> becomes a citizen of the new country, providing that is his intention, he is known legally as an <B><FONT color=blue>alien</FONT></B>, that is, someone who resides in a country but is not a member of it: All <I><FONT color=brown>aliens</FONT></I> must register annually with the Department of Immigration. Once a citizen, such a person is no longer an <I><FONT color=brown>alien</FONT></I>, but he might still be regarded as an <I><FONT color=brown>immigrant</FONT></I> by others so long as his speech, clothes or living habits reflect his country of origin and remain in contrast to the national norm. The xenophobic or unfriendly onlooker could, in fact, call such a naturalized citizen a <I><FONT color=brown>foreigner</FONT></I> to express his own intolerance for any departure from the norm.</P><P>The remaining words are all more general and wider-ranging in their implications. <B><FONT color=blue>Stranger</FONT></B> can indicate anyone who is not known to someone else or who is not familiar with or accepted as part of some group: She hurried past the beckoning <I><FONT color=brown>stranger</FONT></I>; great excitement when <I><FONT color=brown>strangers</FONT></I> came to the remote settlement. <B><FONT color=blue>Newcomer</FONT></B> can refer more informally to an <I><FONT color=brown>immigrant</FONT></I>, but applies more widely to a person only recently accepted into a group, yet still largely unfamiliar with it: a <I><FONT color=brown>newcomer</FONT></I> to Auckland. The word can also suggest an initiate to any area of experience: a <I><FONT color=brown>newcomer</FONT></I> to poetry. Where <I><FONT color=brown>newcomer</FONT></I> suggests recent membership, <B><FONT color=blue>outsider</FONT></B> stresses alienation from or rejection by a group: backblock people who were wary of <I><FONT color=brown>outsiders</FONT></I>; a boy who didn’t have many friends in his class but preferred to remain an <I><FONT color=brown>outsider</FONT></I>; Both labour and management refused to call in an <I><FONT color=brown>outsider</FONT></I> to mediate the dispute.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Beginner">BEGINNER</A>, <A href="entry://Exile">EXILE</A>, <A href="entry://Wanderer">WANDERER</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: citizen, inhabitant, native.</P>

<P>All these words deal with a shrewd, prophetic or mystical ability to anticipate, predict or see into the future. <B><FONT color=blue>Foreknowledge</FONT></B> can refer to a supernatural faculty: Augustine’s treatment of God’s <I><FONT color=brown>foreknowledge</FONT></I> and man’s free will; a medium who claimed to have <I><FONT color=brown>foreknowledge</FONT></I> of the future. <B><FONT color=blue>Prescience</FONT></B>, the most formal of these words, can also point to such a faculty, although it is less often attributed to people than to the Deity: God’s <I><FONT color=brown>prescience</FONT></I> is only one aspect of his general omniscience. Both words, however, can apply without any suggestion of the mystical or supernatural. In this case, <I><FONT color=brown>foreknowledge</FONT></I> would refer to having information concerning something that has not yet occurred: attempts to gain the same <I><FONT color=brown>foreknowledge</FONT></I> of weather conditions that we now have of lunar and solar eclipses; She denied that she had any <I><FONT color=brown>foreknowledge</FONT></I> of the plot in which he was involved. <I><FONT color=brown>Prescience</FONT></I> indicates not the simple ability to anticipate but an acute and intelligent ability to see what lies in store in the future: their <I><FONT color=brown>prescience</FONT></I> concerning the problems that would await them in their new country; his <I><FONT color=brown>prescience</FONT></I> in seeing the dangers of over-population.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Foresight</FONT></B> is an informal alternative for the last meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>prescience</FONT></I>. But, more simply, it can also indicate an ability to think ahead, prepare for eventualities, and take prudent precautions against any undesirable possibility: She had the <I><FONT color=brown>foresight</FONT></I> to lock all the windows, as well as the doors, before leaving on her holiday; the <I><FONT color=brown>foresight</FONT></I> to plan for the inevitable obsolescence of the motor-car as a practical means of transportation. <B><FONT color=blue>Farsightedness</FONT></B> can refer both to an intelligent envisioning of the future, like <I><FONT color=brown>prescience</FONT></I>, or a practical tendency to plan ahead, like <I><FONT color=brown>foresight</FONT></I>. It adds to either situation, however, the specific ability to extend one’s thinking and awareness to the distant rather than the near future: the <I><FONT color=brown>farsightedness</FONT></I> of those who framed the Constitution in allowing for the changing circumstances and needs of future generation. <B><FONT color=blue>Forethought</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>foresight</FONT></I> in meaning; but where <I><FONT color=brown>foresight</FONT></I> might be most aptly applied to envisioning circumstances that are independent of oneself, <I><FONT color=brown>forethought</FONT></I> suggests the careful planning out of something more completely within one’s own control: He could have avoided the accident by using <I><FONT color=brown>forethought</FONT></I>; writers who have the <I><FONT color=brown>forethought</FONT></I> to plan the general outlines of their work well in advance of the actual writing.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Expectation">EXPECTATION</A>, <A href="entry://Predict">PREDICT</A>, <A href="entry://Premonition">PREMONITION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: heedlessness, hindsight, ignorance.</P>

<P>These words refer to oversights or failures to remember or act. <B><FONT color=blue>Forget</FONT></B> suggest a failure to keep something in mind, either because of its unimportance or complexity, or because of an unintentional lapse: She <I><FONT color=brown>forgot</FONT></I> all about the gossip as soon as she reported it; <I><FONT color=brown>forgetting</FONT></I> the way to the station; <I><FONT color=brown>forgetting</FONT></I> to water the plants as he had promised to do.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Overlook</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>omit</FONT></B> are both more specific than <I><FONT color=brown>forget</FONT></I> in suggesting almost exclusively failures to act. The failure may be slight and excusable and may be either intentional or deliberate. <I><FONT color=brown>Overlook</FONT></I> concentrates on a failure to notice or check something: He had <I><FONT color=brown>overlooked</FONT></I> the fact that the back door was not locked; councillors who deliberately <I><FONT color=brown>overlook</FONT></I> the real needs of the city. The word might also refer to a conscious decision to excuse someone else’s failing: He agreed to <I><FONT color=brown>overlook</FONT></I> her breach of confidence this once. <I><FONT color=brown>Omit</FONT></I> suggests a failure to act in a certain approved way. Extenuating circumstances may be implied for the reason of the failure, but conscious intention may also be motivation: <I><FONT color=brown>omitting</FONT></I>, in my haste, to tell her where I was going; <I><FONT color=brown>omitting</FONT></I> to tell the doctor the whole story behind the child’s injury. The word, in a related sense, can refer to the deletion of something, usually because it might be thought disadvantageous or unpleasant: They <I><FONT color=brown>omitted</FONT></I> from the report any mention of the programme’s difficulties. Except in this sense of deletion, <I><FONT color=brown>omit</FONT></I> is the one word here that might no longer sound fresh or natural in ordinary conversation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Neglect</FONT></B> may suggest an inadvertent failure to act, but more often its connotation is one of deliberate inattention: His secretary had <I><FONT color=brown>neglected</FONT></I> to double-check the correspondence file. [<I><FONT color=brown>Forgetting</FONT></I> one or two small details is one thing, but <I><FONT color=brown>neglecting</FONT></I> the major responsibilities of your job is something else again.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cursory">CURSORY</A>, <A href="entry://Neglect">NEGLECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Find">FIND</A>, <A href="entry://Remember">REMEMBER</A>.</P>

forgo
<B><FONT color=blue>forgo</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>give up</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sacrifice</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>waive</FONT></B>:

<P>These words indicate the surrendering of what one has had or is entitled to have. <B><FONT color=blue>Forgo</FONT></B> contrasts with <B><FONT color=blue>give up</FONT></B> because of its greater formality, but otherwise these two terms are alike in being very general. When <I><FONT color=brown>forgo</FONT></I> applies to abstaining from or relinquishing pleasure or benefit, the word usually implies a free choice based on principle: asked to <I><FONT color=brown>forgo</FONT></I> meat during Lent; actors who voluntarily <I><FONT color=brown>forwent</FONT></I> pay for the benefit performance. But the word may also refer to any missed opportunity, regardless of reason: a youngster who <I><FONT color=brown>forwent</FONT></I> a chance to go to university out of sheer laziness; an old refugee who had long ago <I><FONT color=brown>forgone</FONT></I> any hope of seeing his homeland again. <I><FONT color=brown>Give up</FONT></I> could be substituted in most of these instances, but whereas forgo usually implies relinquishing something in advance, <I><FONT color=brown>give up</FONT></I> often implies surrendering something that is already in one’s possession: He <I><FONT color=brown>gave up</FONT></I> his seat on the bus to an old woman standing near by; farmers who <I><FONT color=brown>gave up</FONT></I> their land to the government only after a struggle. As in the last example, <I><FONT color=brown>give up</FONT></I> is more apt than <I><FONT color=brown>forgo</FONT></I> for a reluctant yielding, or one based on necessity or defeat. Intransitively, the term can mean surrender: enemy soldiers who had <I><FONT color=brown>given up</FONT></I>; I <I><FONT color=brown>give up</FONT></I>! </P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Waive</FONT></B> stresses the voluntary yielding possible for <I><FONT color=brown>forgo</FONT></I>, but it is exclusively focused on yielding in advance a right to which one is technically entitled. [The defence <I><FONT color=brown>waived</FONT></I> cross-examination of the witness; Both sides agreed to <I><FONT color=brown>waive</FONT></I> the overtime clause in the contract.] <B><FONT color=blue>Sacrifice</FONT></B> can indicate both the involuntary and voluntary relinquishing of something, but its special point is the hardship entailed in doing so. If a voluntary surrender is indicated, the word implies nobility or generosity in the actor; if an involuntary act is indicated, the word stresses difficulty or even suffering: soldiers willing to <I><FONT color=brown>sacrifice</FONT></I> their lives for their country; those who <I><FONT color=brown>sacrifice</FONT></I> part of their income to help the underprivileged; parents who must scrimp and <I><FONT color=brown>sacrifice</FONT></I> to send their children to university; prison conditions under which inmates are forced to <I><FONT color=brown>sacrifice</FONT></I> the last vestiges of their humanity. In some uses, neither generosity nor difficulty may be present: blithely <I><FONT color=brown>sacrificing</FONT></I> the lives of others to his own self-interest.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Abstain">ABSTAIN</A>, <A href="entry://Forswear">FORSWEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Relinquish">RELINQUISH</A>, <A href="entry://Temperance">TEMPERANCE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Demand">DEMAND</A>, keep, preserve.</P>

<P>These words describe elaborate or precise modes of behaviour. The crucial discrimination to be made among them concerns the positive or negative overtones the words carry. The positive overtone suggests admiration for the skilful carrying out of a beautiful but complicated pattern; the negative overtone suggests abhorrence of an inflexible lack of spontaneity, sincerity or naturalness. The choice of word may tell more about the speaker than about the behaviour described.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Formal</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>proper</FONT></B> are often neutral terms of description pertaining to correctness of behaviour. <I><FONT color=brown>Proper</FONT></I> is almost exclusively restricted to this sense: the <I><FONT color=brown>proper</FONT></I> way of addressing a duke or duchess. <I><FONT color=brown>Proper</FONT></I> may also simply indicate what is appropriate or customary in a specific situation: the <I><FONT color=brown>proper</FONT></I> dress for mountain-climbing. <I><FONT color=brown>Formal</FONT></I>, on the other hand, can refer only to highly stylized situations: the <I><FONT color=brown>formal</FONT></I>, white-tie dinner. <I><FONT color=brown>Formal</FONT></I> dress, for example, would not be <I><FONT color=brown>proper</FONT></I> at a rock ‘n’roll party, whereas jeans and a T-shirt would be <I><FONT color=brown>proper</FONT></I> in this instance, though <I><FONT color=brown>formal</FONT></I> in none. Both <I><FONT color=brown>proper</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>formal</FONT></I> can sometimes suggest the negative side to all these words. [She would be more fun if she weren’t so <I><FONT color=brown>proper</FONT></I>; They felt a lack of warmth in the exceedingly <I><FONT color=brown>formal</FONT></I> congratulations he gave them.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ritual</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ceremonial</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ceremonious</FONT></B> are allied to <I><FONT color=brown>formal</FONT></I> in describing acts or manners that are stylized according to set rules. They describe behaviour that is <I><FONT color=brown>proper</FONT></I> only to the most formalized ceremonies in society. <I><FONT color=brown>Ritual</FONT></I> is neutral or approving when it describes an act that is a part of such a <I><FONT color=brown>ceremony</FONT></I>, especially a religious one: the <I><FONT color=brown>ritual</FONT></I> procession of cardinals. It is more ambiguous when describing a <I><FONT color=brown>formal</FONT></I> gesture not part of such an occasion: He lit the candles with a <I><FONT color=brown>ritual</FONT></I> flourish. It can even suggest perfunctory, indifferent behaviour: a <I><FONT color=brown>ritual</FONT></I> good-night kiss. <I><FONT color=brown>Ceremonious</FONT></I> is most often used to describe people or their stylized behaviour, while <I><FONT color=brown>ceremonial</FONT></I> is often restricted to those acts or artifacts that are part of an actual ceremony: The Japanese are never more <I><FONT color=brown>ceremonious</FONT></I> than when they enact together the <I><FONT color=brown>ceremonial</FONT></I> patterns of the bonodori dances. <I><FONT color=brown>Ceremonious</FONT></I>, in being more general, can refer to any ritualizing of behaviour. If the behaviour is proper to the occasion, the word remains neutral; if not, the word can suggest officiousness or artificiality: Her <I><FONT color=brown>ceremonious</FONT></I> attentions to the guests made relaxed conversation impossible.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Affected</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pompous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>punctilious</FONT></B> deal almost exclusively in the negative side to these words. Only <I><FONT color=brown>punctilious</FONT></I> may suggest a positive value in fastidious concern for detail: the <I><FONT color=brown>punctilious</FONT></I> attention to protocol necessary in diplomatic circles. Where this word emphasizes the precise or over-precise carrying out of a code of behaviour, <I><FONT color=brown>affected</FONT></I> is more likely to refer to an inappropriate pseudo-elegance of manner, especially of speech or gesture: his <I><FONT color=brown>affected</FONT></I> English accent; her <I><FONT color=brown>affected</FONT></I> bargain-basement idea of elegance. <I><FONT color=brown>Affected</FONT></I> behaviour in a man suggests artiness or effeminacy; <I><FONT color=brown>affected</FONT></I> behaviour in a woman suggests are inability to distinguish between a bad or cheap imitation and the real elegance she can only affect. <I><FONT color=brown>Pompous</FONT></I> refers mostly to inflated manners of a stuffy or officious kind, and tends to be used mostly in describing men. It would be used when super-solemn rather than effeminate behaviour is indicated: the droning of the <I><FONT color=brown>pompous</FONT></I> judge. One must remember that what one observer might call <I><FONT color=brown>affected</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>pompous</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>punctilious</FONT></I>, another might call formal, <I><FONT color=brown>ceremonious</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>ritual</FONT></I>.

<P>These words apply when a person rejects something, give up his past behaviour, or withdraws from a previously stated stand or belief. <B><FONT color=blue>Forswear</FONT></B> indicates the renunciation of past behaviour; once, it referred to taking an oath to this effect, but now it can suggest an emphatic willingness to give up something completely. Most often, the word suggests an open admission of guilt or fault arising from such behaviour: a country that <I><FONT color=brown>forswore</FONT></I> future military aggression as a result of its decisive defeat; no use asking alcoholics to make high-minded oaths <I><FONT color=brown>forswearing</FONT></I> drinking. Where <I><FONT color=brown>forswear</FONT></I> can suggest moral resolve or penitence, <B><FONT color=blue>abjure</FONT></B> is more forceful in sometimes implying an angry rejection; it also referred once to renunciation under oath, but less often applies in this way now: a union official who <I><FONT color=brown>abjured</FONT></I> mediation as a solution to the dispute, especially considering the unwillingness of management to negotiate; bitter disappointments that made him <I><FONT color=brown>abjure</FONT></I> marriage in favour of a series of affairs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disavow</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>disclaim</FONT></B> are now most commonly used to deny complicity or responsibility; thus both contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>forswear</FONT></I>, where an admission of guilt is often implied. <I><FONT color=brown>Disavow</FONT></I> once could involve a formal oath; now it more often points to a refusal to acknowledge something as valid or an insistence that no connection exists between one’s own stand and that of another. [The candidate <I><FONT color=brown>disavowed</FONT></I> completely the statement that had been attributed to him by reporters; The board <I><FONT color=brown>disavowed</FONT></I> the action of the executive and denied that his promises were binding on the company.] <I><FONT color=brown>Disclaim</FONT></I> can also function as a denial of responsibility, but its special point is the giving up of a right or title that might be offered in one’s own behalf. [He <I><FONT color=brown>disclaimed</FONT></I> all complicity in the assassination plot; The company <I><FONT color=brown>disclaimed</FONT></I> any interest in the disputed land, even though the original title bore its name.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disown</FONT></B> at its most general can suggest any sort of abandonment: The sponsors <I><FONT color=brown>disowned</FONT></I> the project after the poor showing it made during its first year in operation. The word is often used in a special way, however, referring to the total rejection of a disliked person, often a near relative: a father who <I><FONT color=brown>disowned</FONT></I> his son and wrote him out of his will.</P><P>The remaining words all deal with a retreat from previously stated positions. <B><FONT color=blue>Take back</FONT></B> is the most informal of all these words, applying to an apologetic withdrawal of anything one has said previously. [His friend kept him pinned to the floor until he <I><FONT color=brown>took back</FONT></I> the insult; She immediately <I><FONT color=brown>took back</FONT></I> her accusation once she saw how wrong she had been.] <B><FONT color=blue>Retract</FONT></B> can apply to the same situation, often indicating a formal, official or public statement. [He threatened to sue unless his opponent <I><FONT color=brown>retracted</FONT></I> the libellous allegation; The defendant <I><FONT color=brown>retracted</FONT></I> his confession, claming that it had been coerced.] <B><FONT color=blue>Recant</FONT></B> once indicated the solemn retracting of a heresy by a former adherent: Witches were required to <I><FONT color=brown>recant</FONT></I> publicly or be hanged. It still applies to the repudiation of doctrine or ideology and is more forceful than <I><FONT color=brown>retract</FONT></I> in suggesting a total <I><FONT color=brown>disavowing</FONT></I> or abject capitulation, including an admission of past guilt and an implied promise to <I><FONT color=brown>forswear</FONT></I> the error in the future: those who <I><FONT color=brown>recanted</FONT></I> Communism after Russia’s ruthless suppression of the Hungarian revolt in 1956.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Abstain">ABSTAIN</A>, <A href="entry://Forgo">FORGO</A>, <A href="entry://Relinquish">RELINQUISH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Acknowledge">ACKNOWLEDGE</A>, <A href="entry://Assert">ASSERT</A>, claim, uphold.</P>

<P>These words all refer to something upon which something else rests or depends. <B><FONT color=blue>Basis</FONT></B> differs from <B><FONT color=blue>base</FONT></B> in being more often used in metaphorical senses: The <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I> of his argument was that the victory was unattainable without seriously jeopardizing domestic programmes. <I><FONT color=brown>Base</FONT></I>, on the other hand, normally refers to physical objects that form the lowest or supporting part of anything: the <I><FONT color=brown>base</FONT></I> of a statue. It can be used metaphorically as well: the <I><FONT color=brown>base</FONT></I> of a theory. In this sense <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>base</FONT></I> are practically synonymous; <I><FONT color=brown>base</FONT></I>, however, more often suggests the idea of an underlying foundation, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I> is broader in application and may suggest the idea of a central or fundamental part s well as that of an underlying principle. [Axioms are the <I><FONT color=brown>base</FONT></I> of geometry; The <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I> of his decision; One what <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I> do you propose to pay me?]</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Foundation</FONT></I> can mean the base on which something rests: the <I><FONT color=brown>foundation</FONT></I> of a building. <I><FONT color=brown>Foundation</FONT></I> suggests a more imposing, solid structure than <I><FONT color=brown>base</FONT></I>, which can apply to the bottom part of anything: the <I><FONT color=brown>base</FONT></I> of a lamp; the <I><FONT color=brown>foundation</FONT></I> of an ancient city. <I><FONT color=brown>Foundation</FONT></I> also means that on which anything is founded, and in this sense is close to <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I>: The <I><FONT color=brown>foundation</FONT></I> of democracy is the will of the people to preserve liberty. It should perhaps be noted that <I><FONT color=brown>foundation</FONT></I> is now used commercially to refer to a variety support, such as facial make-up applied beneath other make-up and certain undergarments that hold in vital parts of the body so that outer-garments do not reveal their actual shape.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ground</FONT></B>, as here considered, means a <I><FONT color=brown>foundation</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I> for a decision, argument or relationship. It often used in the plural, it may be construed as singular. [The <I><FONT color=brown>grounds</FONT></I> for his decision was never clearly stated; Absenteeism constitutes <I><FONT color=brown>grounds</FONT></I> for dismissal.] <I><FONT color=brown>Grounds</FONT></I> implies the underpinnings of reason: Leverrier’s mathematical computations were the <I><FONT color=brown>grounds</FONT></I> for his theory that there was a planet beyond Uranus.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Centre">CENTRE</A>, <A href="entry://Kernel">KERNEL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: superstructure, top.</P>

<P>These words refer to things easily broken. <B><FONT color=blue>Fragile</FONT></B>, beyond this general meaning, may suggest weakness or delicacy as well: a <I><FONT color=brown>fragile</FONT></I> teacup; the shipping of <I><FONT color=brown>fragile</FONT></I> materials; her <I><FONT color=brown>fragile</FONT></I> health; a lovely, <I><FONT color=brown>fragile</FONT></I> embroidery of flower motifs. <B><FONT color=blue>Frail</FONT></B> carries its own implication of slenderness or enfeeblement, as well as of breakability or weakness: a <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> scaffold; <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> columns bearing the architrave; made <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> by persisting bouts of malaria.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brittle</FONT></B>, like fragile, need not suggest slightness or slenderness, and it is also less apt than either of the previous words to indicate weakness or delicacy of construction. It refers to any hard material that tends to shatter easily under a direct impact: <I><FONT color=brown>Glass</FONT></I> is brittle, choosing building stones less brittle than marble or granite. More metaphorically, it contrasts sharply with the softness that may be implied by <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I>, suggesting instead a hard, brusque manner or appearance: giving him a <I><FONT color=brown>brittle</FONT></I>, contemptuous reply.</P><P>The remaining words are considerably more formal than the foregoing and are also much more specific in meaning. <B><FONT color=blue>Frangible</FONT></B> may be used only to indicate breakability; but, more relevantly here, it is often applied to materials specifically designed to be broken: a <I><FONT color=brown>frangible</FONT></I> capsule of ammonia that is broken and held under the fainting person’s nose. <B><FONT color=blue>Friable</FONT></B> is even more restricted in meaning, referring exclusively to materials that can be easily crumbled: sandstone slabs that are not <I><FONT color=brown>brittle</FONT></I> but tend to be <I><FONT color=brown>friable</FONT></I>.

<P>These words refer to a small part or piece separated from a larger whole. <B><FONT color=blue><I><FONT color=brown>Fragment</FONT></B> </FONT></I>stresses breakage. In a literal sense, a <I><FONT color=brown>fragment</FONT></I> is a broken piece or shard: Archaeologists discovered <I><FONT color=brown>fragments</FONT></I> of a marble column; a prehistoric man imaginatively reconstructed from bone <I><FONT color=brown>fragments</FONT></I>. Where <I><FONT color=brown>fragment</FONT></I> is typically, though not always, used of a brittle substance, the other words in this set may all apply to bits and pieces of cloth or food. In a specific sense, a <B><FONT color=blue>remnant<I><FONT color=brown></FONT></B> </FONT></I>is a piece of cloth left over, as from a bolt, after the final measured cutting: to buy carpet remnants on sale. In a general sense, it may refer to any remaining par or potion: the <I><FONT color=brown>remnants</FONT></I> of the unfinished meal. A <B><FONT color=blue>scrap</FONT></B> is a small, odd piece that has been cut, broken or torn from a larger piece: a <I><FONT color=brown>scrap</FONT></I> of silk. <I><FONT color=brown>Scrap</FONT></I> may refer to paper as well as to cloth or food; and where <I><FONT color=brown>remnants</FONT></I> may be saved for future use, <I><FONT color=brown>scraps</FONT></I> are often disposed of. Like <I><FONT color=brown>scrap</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>shred</FONT></B> may apply to a variety of substances. A <I><FONT color=brown>shred</FONT></I> is a long and narrow piece or strip, as one torn, cut or shaved off lengthwise: <I><FONT color=brown>shreds</FONT></I> of carrot in a salad; <I><FONT color=brown>shreds</FONT></I> of paper. Used of fabric, the plural <I><FONT color=brown>shreds</FONT></I> suggests a reduction to rags and tatters: In the fight, his suit was torn to <I><FONT color=brown>shreds</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Shred</FONT></I> may also refer to a string-like piece of something, as food: <I><FONT color=brown>shredded</FONT></I> wheat.</P><P>All these words have extended, metaphorical uses. <I><FONT color=brown>Fragment</FONT></I> may designate any part incomplete in itself, existing, considered, perceived or treated apart from a larger, inclusive context. <I><FONT color=brown>Fragments</FONT></I> may be all that remain of the work of an ancient poet. On the other hand, a <I><FONT color=brown>fragment</FONT></I> of a novel may be a piece of writing going up to the point where the writer broke off, leaving the conceptual whole uncompleted. <I><FONT color=brown>Fragment</FONT></I> may also refer to an isolated bit or part of anything abstract or immaterial. [Even the greatest scholar knows only a <I><FONT color=brown>fragment</FONT></I> of all there is to know; He overheard <I><FONT color=brown>fragments</FONT></I> of their conversation.] In a broad sense, <I><FONT color=brown>remnant</FONT></I> may mean a remaining trace or vestige of anything: <I><FONT color=brown>remnants</FONT></I> of early Roman settlements; a penniless aristocrat jealously guarding the <I><FONT color=brown>remnants</FONT></I> of past glory. It may also refer to a small remaining number of people: the last tattered remnants of the defeated regiment. <I><FONT color=brown>Scrap</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>shred</FONT></I> may apply to any particle, or to the smallest amount: our last <I><FONT color=brown>shred</FONT></I> of hope; not a <I><FONT color=brown>scrap</FONT></I> of proof.

The word does suggest desperation and ineffective haste; it also may stress action taken under extreme pressure: the <I><FONT color=brown>frantic</FONT></I> pace of the big cities. <B><FONT color=blue>Hectic</FONT></B> is specific in exclusively stressing this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>frantic</FONT></I>. The note of desperation is not necessarily present, and the word may simply refer hyperbolically to a rush of events: those <I><FONT color=brown>hectic</FONT></I> days after the first discovery of gold; the <I><FONT color=brown>hectic</FONT></I> traffic during peak hours. <B><FONT color=blue>Frenetic</FONT></B> also relates to this sense of <I><FONT color=brown>frantic</FONT></I>, but it may suggest suspense and excitement rather than the desperation of <I><FONT color=brown>frantic</FONT></I> or the busy swiftness of <I><FONT color=brown>hectic</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>frenetic</FONT></I> last minutes of the tied basketball game; the <I><FONT color=brown>frenetic</FONT></I> race against the printer’s deadline.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>hectic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>frenetic</FONT></B> have roots or older uses that refer to a feverish physical illness. Only <I><FONT color=brown>delirious</FONT></I> would now be pertinent in this context, since it can literally suggest the confused mental state resulting from a fever. In other uses, it escapes the specific situation of physical illness, referring instead to wild excitement; but it still hyperbolically suggests a confused, helpless or disordered mental state: the grandstand crowd that was flushed with victory and <I><FONT color=brown>delirious</FONT></I> with joy; the <I><FONT color=brown>delirious</FONT></I> new dances that emphasize self-isolation and dehumanizing incoherence. <I><FONT color=brown>Frantic</FONT></I>, used in a favourable sense, compares with <I><FONT color=brown>delirious</FONT></I> here. As a term of approbation, it may stress a wild aliveness or a joyfully giddy whirl: a <I><FONT color=brown>frantic</FONT></I> party; The music was <I><FONT color=brown>frantic</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Frenzied</FONT></B> intensifies the note of desperation in frantic; it suggests a person completely out of control, one who is goaded or driven by external or internal pressures to act in a completely disorganized way: the charging bull, <I><FONT color=brown>frenzied</FONT></I> by frequent woundings; the rioters shouting <I><FONT color=brown>frenzied</FONT></I> accusations. <B><FONT color=blue>Furious</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests a fierceness of behaviour stemming mainly from anger. The word is not nearly so intense as these other words. A person might be <I><FONT color=brown>furious</FONT></I>, but not give the slightest sign of his emotional state; or he might give vent to his <I><FONT color=brown>furious</FONT></I> anger, but still remain in control of himself: his cold but <I><FONT color=brown>furious</FONT></I> summation to the jury. The word may also merely suggest haste, like <I><FONT color=brown>frantic</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>hectic</FONT></I>: fast and <I><FONT color=brown>furious</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>furious</FONT></I> rapids above the waterfall.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anger">ANGER</A>, <A href="entry://Frenzy">FRENZY</A>, <A href="entry://Psychotic">PSYCHOTIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Imperturbable">IMPERTURBABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Slow">SLOW</A>, <A href="entry://Tranquil">TRANQUIL</A>, unhurried.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>frenzy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>delirium</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hysteria</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mania</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to extreme states of mental agitation, craving, disorder or abnormality. <B><FONT color=blue>Frenzy</FONT></B> is the most general of these in stressing extreme agitation of any sort for whatever reason: in a <I><FONT color=brown>frenzy</FONT></I> to meet his deadline. Usually, the word suggests an actual acting out of the mental state in rapid but possibly disordered movements: the <I><FONT color=brown>frenzy</FONT></I> with which they struggled to put out the fire raging through the building. Also, the word suggests a given spurt of seizure of emotion that goads one into action, rather than a steady or constant state: the <I><FONT color=brown>frenzy</FONT></I> of activity during harvest time. When the word refers to emotional imbalance rather than hyperbolically indicating frantic effort, the emotions suggested include hate, anger, terror or other negative responses to externals: driven by a cold <I><FONT color=brown>frenzy</FONT></I> to kill his opponent. <B><FONT color=blue>Mania</FONT></B> in one of its particulars contrasts strongly with this suggestion of negative response in <I><FONT color=brown>frenzy</FONT></I>, since it can refer to an extreme liking or craving for something: a <I><FONT color=brown>mania</FONT></I> for collecting rare books. Furthermore, a <I><FONT color=brown>mania</FONT></I> may be present over a long period of time without necessarily being acted out: never having indulged his secret <I><FONT color=brown>mania</FONT></I> for camping outdoors. In a psychiatric context, the word is used more strictly to refer to a mental disorder in which one is pervaded with a sense of well-being but acts in excessive and deranged ways: the <I><FONT color=brown>mania</FONT></I> that alternates with melancholy in the typical manic-depressive.</P><P>Where <I><FONT color=brown>frenzy</FONT></I> may suggest angry outbursts and mania a continual craving, <B><FONT color=blue>hysteria</FONT></B> suggests emotional seizures of grief or fear as expressed by uncontrolled sobbing: the <I><FONT color=brown>hysteria</FONT></I> of many aboard the sinking ship. Uncontrolled laughter is also a possible result of <I><FONT color=brown>hysteria</FONT></I>, although such laughter would hardly stem from even an illusory happiness. Psychiatrically, the word refers to an abnormal condition resulting from nervous malfunction or sexual repression and characterized by violent emotional paroxysms and disturbances in the sensory and motor functions: the crippled woman whose classic case of <I><FONT color=brown>hysteria</FONT></I> set Freud to devising his psychoanalytic theories.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Delirium</FONT></B> indicates a deranged state that may be the by-product of fever, epilepsy or alcoholism, or the primary effect of narcotic or psychedelic drugs. The word may suggest agitation like <I><FONT color=brown>frenzy</FONT></I>, but it does not necessarily suggest any physical activity whatsoever; it does indicate a rambling or hallucinating mind: a <I><FONT color=brown>delirium</FONT></I> in which he thought he had stepped out of his body and looked back on it. More loosely, the word can refer to any feverish state or nightmare-ridden sleep: a <I><FONT color=brown>delirium</FONT></I> of troubled dreams from which he woke in a cold sweat. Hyperbolically, <I><FONT color=brown>delirium</FONT></I> is sometimes used to indicate uncontrollable excitement, wild emotion or <I><FONT color=brown>frenzied</FONT></I> rapture: a <I><FONT color=brown>delirium</FONT></I> of joy.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Delusion">DELUSION</A>, <A href="entry://Frantic">FRANTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Psychotic">PSYCHOTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Upset">UPSET</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to a close or informal relationship with another person, distinguished on one hand from formal business relationships and on the other from closer love or family relationships. <B><FONT color=blue>Friend</FONT></B> in Shakespearean England meant one’s mistress. Now, of course, it has lost this sexual meaning completely and means simply a person one is fond of and chooses to associate with. A business associate, one’s spouse, or a member of one’s family all may or may not be one’s <I><FONT color=brown>friend</FONT></I>, while a <I><FONT color=brown>friend</FONT></I>, conversely, may or may not be a person with whom one would wish to work or live. An <B><FONT color=blue>acquaintance</FONT></B> is a person one has met and sees occasionally with cordiality but without intimacy: <I><FONT color=brown>acquaintances</FONT></I> who were destined never to become <I><FONT color=brown>friends</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Companion</FONT></B> is ambiguous. It may suggest the closeness of <I><FONT color=brown>friend</FONT></I>: my constant <I><FONT color=brown>companion</FONT></I>. Or it may suggest the casual association of <I><FONT color=brown>acquaintance</FONT></I>: my <I><FONT color=brown>companions</FONT></I> on the ocean liner. In either case, it stresses the physical presence of the person referred to; in the latter case, the relationship might be controlled strictly by chance or necessity, without even the implied cordiality of <I><FONT color=brown>acquaintance</FONT></I>.</P><P>The rest of these words relate to the closeness of <I><FONT color=brown>friend</FONT></I>, each with a unique overtone that implies its own particular kind of closeness. <B><FONT color=blue>Intimate</FONT></B> suggests inseparable and affectionate friendship, but is less frequently used in this sense nowadays, because the sexual reference of the word in another context obtrudes here where no note of sexuality was originally intended. <B><FONT color=blue>Comrade</FONT></B> also has suffered because of the obtrusion of another meaning of the word. Originally used for a man’s male <I><FONT color=brown>friend</FONT></I>, with jolliness and heartness as overtones, it has lost out to its specific use as a form of address among members of the Communist Party: Prince Hal’s bawdy <I><FONT color=brown>comrades</FONT></I>; his <I><FONT color=brown>comrades</FONT></I> on the revolutionary council that governed the country.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crony</FONT></B> is now a more widely used informal word for a close <I><FONT color=brown>friend</FONT></I> than either <I><FONT color=brown>intimate</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>comrade</FONT></I>, but it has a strong colloquial tang and implies the gossipy closeness of a clique: his <I><FONT color=brown>cronies</FONT></I> at the club. Its common form, "<I><FONT color=brown>old crony</FONT></I>," suggests a relationship of long standing based on reminiscence: <I><FONT color=brown>old cronies</FONT></I> who on Saturday nights relived the major battles of World War II. Many slang words exist to describe close <I><FONT color=brown>friends</FONT></I>; the most common are <B><FONT color=blue>mate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cobber</FONT></B>, although the latter is not so widely used as it once was. These partially replace such choices as chum, pal or the Americanism buddy: my <I><FONT color=brown>mate</FONT></I> at work; one of my best <I><FONT color=brown>cobbers</FONT></I>. The frequency with which words for a male <I><FONT color=brown>friend</FONT></I> rise into an fall from favour perhaps suggests an embarrassment over the affectionate side of friendship and a continuing search for the referent whose neutral and casual tone will be considered uncompromising in its manliness. <I><FONT color=brown>Mate</FONT></I> has become a very general term, for both an intimate friend and a fellow worker or associate.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Confidant</FONT></B> compares with <I><FONT color=brown>crony</FONT></I> in suggesting an exchange of gossip as the staple of a friendship. Where crony more commonly refers to a man’s male <I><FONT color=brown>friend</FONT></I>, however, <I><FONT color=brown>confidant</FONT></I> refers often to a woman’s female <I><FONT color=brown>companion</FONT></I>. A further implication suggests that the talk exchanged between <I><FONT color=brown>confidants</FONT></I> is not so much reminiscence as personal secrets.

<B><FONT color=blue>frighten</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>scare</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>startle</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>terrify</FONT></B>:

<P>These words mean to fill with fear or apprehension. <B><FONT color=blue>Frighten</FONT></B> is the most general word, having the widest range of uses. It often indicates a fear of physical harm, but it may also apply to fears rooted in emotion or arising from imagination. In an immediate sense, a person is <I><FONT color=brown>frightened</FONT></I> by a cause of fear addressed directly and suddenly to the senses. He may react physically in a number of negative ways ?shivering, shuddering, freezing, fainting, screaming, running, hiding, having a heart attack. At one extreme, being <I><FONT color=brown>frightened</FONT></I> may involve only a brief pang or flutter of fear: <I><FONT color=brown>frightened</FONT></I> by a strange noise in the middle of the night. At the other extreme, it may imply dread or terror that paralyses thought, motion or response, leaving one in a state of shock: a pedestrian crossing absent-mindedly against the light, <I><FONT color=brown>frightened</FONT></I> into immobility by an onrushing car. <I><FONT color=brown>Frighten</FONT></I> is also used to indicate a fearful, apprehensive state of mind: The prospect of being deserted by her husband deeply <I><FONT color=brown>frightened</FONT></I> her.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scare</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>frighten</FONT></I> in that it can imply either sudden, unnerving fear or a fearful, uneasy state. Even more strongly than <I><FONT color=brown>frighten</FONT></I>, it stresses a reflex physical reaction, whether literal or figurative: <I><FONT color=brown>scared</FONT></I> stiff. But <I><FONT color=brown>scare</FONT></I> is a more informal word than <I><FONT color=brown>frighten</FONT></I> and may suggest a milder or more superficial form of fear, whatever the cause. [He is <I><FONT color=brown>scared</FONT></I> of the dark; Out approach <I><FONT color=brown>scared</FONT></I> the rabbit and he ran.] <I><FONT color=brown>Scare</FONT></I> is also often used to suggest the deliberate stimulation of fear, as in games, teasing, initiation, practical jokes or other forms of amusement, whether harmless or dangerous: a <I><FONT color=brown>scary</FONT></I> movie; to <I><FONT color=brown>scare</FONT></I> children with a ghost story. [I <I><FONT color=brown>scared</FONT></I> you, didn’t I? The stunt pilot <I><FONT color=brown>sacred</FONT></I> them half to death.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Startle</FONT></B> stresses the element of sudden surprise, usually involving an involuntary reaction to an unexpected stimulus. A <I><FONT color=brown>startled</FONT></I> person may gasp, jump, draw back or make a quick, jerky movement and then freeze. [Oh! You <I><FONT color=brown>startled</FONT></I> me ?I didn’t see you come in; <I><FONT color=brown>startled</FONT></I> by a rabbit running across his path.] In another sense, <I><FONT color=brown>startle</FONT></I> may simply indicate an inner, intellectual surprise at something unexpected: <I><FONT color=brown>startled</FONT></I> by their daughter’s request but trying hard not to show it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Terrify</FONT></B> is the strongest of these words, suggesting extreme, overwhelming fear that is close to panic: The violence of the storm <I><FONT color=brown>terrified</FONT></I> the sailors. The word may be an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>frighten</FONT></I> in the sense of fear that paralyses all the faculties, physical and mental: too <I><FONT color=brown>terrified</FONT></I> to speak. But it may also suggest wild, frenzied activity aimed at escaping a threatening situation: <I><FONT color=brown>terrified</FONT></I> people trying to get out of a burning building. In a looser sense, <I><FONT color=brown>terrify</FONT></I> is sometimes used hyperbolically to imply intimidation or nervous agitation: <I><FONT color=brown>terrified</FONT></I> by the exam; <I><FONT color=brown>terrified</FONT></I> that she would be late.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Afraid">AFRAID</A>, <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Intimidate">INTIMIDATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: calm, comfort, quiet, soothe, tranquillize.</P>

<P>These words all refer to movement that is high-spirited, zestful and exuberant. <B><FONT color=blue>Frisk</FONT></B> suggests quick, playful eager movements: dogs <I><FONT color=brown>frisking</FONT></I> about in the courtyard; letting the children <I><FONT color=brown>frisk</FONT></I> and scramble all day on the beach. The emphasis of <B><FONT color=blue>frolic</FONT></B> is close to that of <I><FONT color=brown>frisk</FONT></I>, but it stresses even more a playful, joyous activity: a playground where children skip and generally <I><FONT color=brown>frolic</FONT></I> without a worry in the world. <I><FONT color=brown>Frolic</FONT></I>, furthermore, can apply to a whole series of actions marked by joy, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>frisk</FONT></I> tends to suggest specific individual movements.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Caper</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>gambol</FONT></B> are like frisk in indicating certain kinds of movement. <I><FONT color=brown>Caper</FONT></I> is the most specific of these, suggesting a dance-like way of jumping or leaping with a lively, bounding motion: teenagers <I><FONT color=brown>capering</FONT></I> kids. <I><FONT color=brown>Gambol</FONT></I> suggests an impulsive series of skipping, bounding or jerking movements that may seem unsteady, uneven or erratic: lambs <I><FONT color=brown>gambolling</FONT></I> in the meadow after their more sedate mother ewe.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Playful">PLAYFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Skip">SKIP</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: mope, sulk.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>frown</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>grimace</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pout</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>scowl</FONT></B>:

<P>These words, which are alike in being both nouns and verbs, are comparable in their denotation of the deliberate or involuntary distortion of a person’s facial expression because of displeasure, annoyance, pain or the like. <B><FONT color=blue>Frown</FONT></B> is the most familiar word. As visually perceived, a <I><FONT color=brown>frown</FONT></I> involves a knitting, contracting or wrinkling of the brows. As an expression, a <I><FONT color=brown>frown</FONT></I> can be a conscious or unconscious indication of displeasure or puzzlement. [The teacher <I><FONT color=brown>frowned</FONT></I> with annoyance when a student fell asleep during his lesson.] Mostly, though, a facial <I><FONT color=brown>frown</FONT></I> is involuntary. It can be simple reaction to strong light: Many people who cannot wear sunglasses develop deep creases in their foreheads from <I><FONT color=brown>frowning</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>frown</FONT></I> can also be the result of deep concentration or thought. [The novel was very amusing, but it required so much attention that I often found myself <I><FONT color=brown>frowning</FONT></I> when I should have laughed.] In a figurative sense, <I><FONT color=brown>frowning</FONT></I> registers disapproval or distaste: to <I><FONT color=brown>frown</FONT></I> upon over-indulgence in food or drink.</P><P>The word with the most extensive application is <B><FONT color=blue>grimace</FONT></B>. A <I><FONT color=brown>grimace</FONT></I> is a distortion of the features, either habitual or momentary, that is caused by some feeling or impulse. It is usually ugly and uncontrollable, as when it is caused by pain or annoyance. [The agonizing pain of arthritis gave his face a constant <I><FONT color=brown>grimace</FONT></I>; A <I><FONT color=brown>grimace</FONT></I> appeared on the shopkeeper’s face every time a child approached the shelf of fragile articles.] But a <I><FONT color=brown>grimace</FONT></I> can be a deliberate attempt to provoke laughter, as when someone "makes a face": When the comedian’s lines fell flat, he resorted to <I><FONT color=brown>grimacing</FONT></I> to get laughter from his audience.</P><P>Although <B><FONT color=blue>pout</FONT></B> can refer to a general sullenness of behaviour, it more often is like frown in its designation of a special facial expression. <I><FONT color=brown>Pout</FONT></I> means to push out the lips, as in displeasure or ill humour. It is sometimes used in describing adults, but usually <I><FONT color=brown>pout</FONT></I> suggests the behaviour of a child. [The little girl <I><FONT color=brown>pouted</FONT></I> all the afternoon because her mother had refused to buy her a new dress.] A <B><FONT color=blue>scowl</FONT></B> is a lowering of the brows, much like a <I><FONT color=brown>frown</FONT></I>. It can indicate the same kind of displeasure or annoyance that a <I><FONT color=brown>frown</FONT></I> does. But the emotions that generate a <I><FONT color=brown>scowl</FONT></I> are usually stronger than those that produce a <I><FONT color=brown>frown</FONT></I>. There is a strong suggestion of anger, a threatening quality, and certainly an air of sullenness in a <I><FONT color=brown>scowl</FONT></I>. [His <I><FONT color=brown>scowl</FONT></I> hinted at the menace that lay behind his carefully modulated voice and calm demeanour.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Fold">FOLD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Smile">SMILE</A>.</P>

<P>These adjectives are comparable when applied to that which has reached maturity or completion. <B><FONT color=blue>Full-fledged</FONT></B> is the most clourful word. Its literal reference is to a bird whose wing feathers are full grown, enabling it to fly. The noun fledgling is applied to a young bird that has just grown enough feathers for flight; and, by extension, it designates a person who is inexperienced or immature. But <I><FONT color=brown>full-fledged</FONT></I> stresses accomplishment, implying that a training or developing period is past and that full, independent status has been attained: a <I><FONT color=brown>full-fledged</FONT></I> teacher as opposed to a teacher trainee; a <I><FONT color=brown>full-fledged</FONT></I> doctor as opposed to a resident; a <I><FONT color=brown>full-fledged</FONT></I> pilot who has finished his flight training and has won his wings.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Seasoned</FONT></B> goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>full-fledged</FONT></I>, suggesting not only qualification but maturity or experience. Applied to timber, it indicates a drying or hardening process whereby the wood is made more suitable for use. Used of persons, it implies the development of expert skills and professional reliability through long practice: a <I><FONT color=brown>seasoned</FONT></I> polo team; a <I><FONT color=brown>seasoned</FONT></I> trouper, able to go on with the show despite laryngitis; a drill sergeant who took raw recruits and turned them into <I><FONT color=brown>seasoned</FONT></I> troops. A <I><FONT color=brown>seasoned</FONT></I> politician is one who has become astute and adroit in practical politics through having weathered many campaigns.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Finished</FONT></B> stresses polish and resulting elegance. <I><FONT color=brown>Finished</FONT></I> furniture has a polished surface. An artist with a <I><FONT color=brown>finished</FONT></I> technique has polished his style to an ultimate degree. A <I><FONT color=brown>finished</FONT></I> musician, as contrasted with a merely competent one, has refined his skills and has achieved excellence. <B><FONT color=blue>Perfected</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>finished</FONT></I> but is more emphatic in stressing consummate mastery or faultless excellence: A <I><FONT color=brown>perfected</FONT></I> technique is the mark of a virtuoso.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Attainment">ATTAINMENT</A>, <A href="entry://Exquisite">EXQUISITE</A>, <A href="entry://Finish">FINISH</A>, MATURE (adj.), <A href="entry://Perfect">PERFECT</A>, <A href="entry://Reach">REACH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: apprentice, callow, fledging, immature, inexperience, raw, undeveloped, unfledged, unseasoned.</P>

<P>These words refer to acts that give impetus to something already under way. <B><FONT color=blue>Further</FONT></B> is the most neutral of these in indicating any sort of action of effect, intentional or not, whether stemming from the primary agent involved or from an outside person, force or factor: needing a rich patron to <I><FONT color=brown>further</FONT></I> his career; a pleasant voice that, without his realizing it, <I><FONT color=brown>furthered</FONT></I> the good impression he made on other people. The word can as easily be applied to undesirable developments: crisis conditions that <I><FONT color=brown>furthered</FONT></I> the spreading of hysterical rumours. <B><FONT color=blue>Push</FONT></B> is used informally to indicate a furthering of one’s chances by the good offices or influence of another: He promised to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> their case when it came before the committee. <B><FONT color=blue>Advance</FONT></B> has more force than <I><FONT color=brown>further</FONT></I> and thus is useful for stressing intentional and decisive effort to <I><FONT color=brown>further</FONT></I> something desirable: selfless patriots who <I><FONT color=brown>advance</FONT></I> the cause of freedom. Despite these positive overtones, the word can be used, with the same increase in force, for undesirable developments: malnutrition that only <I><FONT color=brown>advanced</FONT></I> the progress of the disease. Here, in fact, the word suggests the speeding up of a harmful process. <I><FONT color=brown>Advance</FONT></I> does not carry this added weight in some of its milder uses, where it simply indicates a moving forward, putting forward, or giving before hand: armies <I><FONT color=brown>advancing</FONT></I> through the city; <I><FONT color=brown>advancing</FONT></I> his suggestion timidly; <I><FONT color=brown>advancing</FONT></I> part of next week’s allowance.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Contribute</FONT></B> contrasts sharply with the foregoing by suggesting secondary factors that give helpful but not crucial assistance to something solidly under way. <I><FONT color=brown>Further</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>advance</FONT></I> can conceivably suggest aid without which no more forward movement would result. This is far less true of <I><FONT color=brown>contribute</FONT></I>: recalling the lucky accidents that had <I><FONT color=brown>contributed</FONT></I> to her hard-earned success. The secondary factors suggested by the word may derive from intentional or fortuitous acts or from established characteristics of the subject involved, as well as from external causes: internal weaknesses that <I><FONT color=brown>contributed</FONT></I> to the empire’s rapid decline. <B><FONT color=blue>Implement</FONT></B> is a fad word in governmental or sociological parlance for the act of making more effective those arrangements that exist in theory, though not always in fact: taking steps to <I><FONT color=brown>implement</FONT></I> the long-standing ban against press censorship. Sometimes, the word seems to suggest the putting into effect of newly established programmes, or the enforcement of decisions that have been newly arrived at: <I><FONT color=brown>implementing</FONT></I> the new clearway regulations.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Go">GO</A>, <A href="entry://Help">HELP</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Delay">DELAY</A>, <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, prevent, sidetrack.</P>

<P>These words denote, in varying degrees, feelings of strong displeasure or antagonism directed against the causes of an assumed wrong or injury. <B><FONT color=blue>Anger</FONT></B>, the most general word of this group, provides no clue as to the direction of this feeling or its means of expression. One may feel <I><FONT color=brown>anger</FONT></I> at an unfortunate turn of events, at oneself or at another person. <B><FONT color=blue>Rage</FONT></B> often implies a loss of self-control, and <B><FONT color=blue>fury</FONT></B>, the strongest word in the group, suggests a <I><FONT color=brown>rage</FONT></I> so violent that it may approach madness. [The surly insolence of the waiters drove him into a <I><FONT color=brown>rage</FONT></I>, and he flung his serviette to the floor and stalked out of the restaurant; They <I><FONT color=brown>fury</FONT></I> of a woman scorned, according to Congreve, is unmatched in hell; Mad with <I><FONT color=brown>fury</FONT></I>, he pounded his fists on the wall and beat his breast.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indignation</FONT></B> denotes anger based on a moral condemnation of something felt to be disgraceful or ignoble: Abolitionists viewed the institution of slavery with <I><FONT color=brown>indignation</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Wrath</FONT></B>, now limited in use to literature and figures of speech, suggests a strong anger directed at some specific person or thing. The source of <I><FONT color=brown>wrath</FONT></I> is always impressive, sometimes divine; hence it traditionally inspires awe and fear: the <I><FONT color=brown>wrath</FONT></I> of the gods. <B><FONT color=blue>Ire</FONT></B>, meaning anger or indignation, is no longer encountered except in poetry and period literature: His <B><FONT color=blue>ire</FONT></B> was strongly provoked by the discourtesy of the host in failing to address him by his proper title.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Resentment">RESENTMENT</A>.</P><P>ANTONYSM: amiability, calmness, clemency, docility, forbearance, gentleness, leniency, placidity, tranquillity.</P>

<P>All these words mean openings or separations of parts by edged or pointed instruments. A <B><FONT color=blue>cut</FONT></B> may be of any size and may be produced by any kind of instrument, intended for cutting or not. A bulldozer may produce a <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> in a mound; the edge of a piece of paper may produce a <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> on the finger. An <B><FONT color=blue>incision</FONT></B> is a <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> made for the purpose of gaining entry. The word is mostly used in surgery: an abdominal <I><FONT color=brown>incision</FONT></I> to expose an inflamed appendix. A <B><FONT color=blue>gash</FONT></B> is a long and broad <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I>, usually accidentally produced: Flying windscreen glass produced a <I><FONT color=brown>gash</FONT></I> on the face of a witness to the level-crossing accident. A <B><FONT color=blue>slash</FONT></B> is a long, often deep <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I>, usually administered with intent to injure with some sharp instrument like a sword or a knife, and is produced by a long, swinging motion. A <B><FONT color=blue>slit</FONT></B> is a long, thin <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>incision</FONT></I>. Some surgical incisions are mere <I><FONT color=brown>slits</FONT></I>; a letter-opener produces a <I><FONT color=brown>slit</FONT></I> in an envelope.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Gash</FONT></I> often suggests a jagged, ugly wound, whereas slash stresses the length and depth of the wound, which may have been cleanly made; <I><FONT color=brown>slit</FONT></I> describes a more precisely made and usually narrower <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I>. [The <I><FONT color=brown>gash</FONT></I> on his leg from the barbed wire took thirteen stitches to close; the <I><FONT color=brown>slash</FONT></I> from the sabre extended from his shoulder to his forearm; The <I><FONT color=brown>slit</FONT></I> in his throat enabled the surgeon to insert a tube to assist his breathing.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Harm">HARM</A>, <A href="entry://Wound">WOUND</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a graceless mode of social behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Gauche</FONT></B> refers to someone or his actions when they do not conform to the standards of the social group in which he finds himself; he may, consequently, be considered unsophisticated, vulgar or ill-bred by the group: certain American mannerisms that would be thought <I><FONT color=brown>gauche</FONT></I> in England. The term may be used as a subjective evaluation of quite innocent or harmless but intentional behaviour. In the case of <B><FONT color=blue>maladroit</FONT></B>, the questionable behaviour is inadvertent but results in injured feelings or resentment because it is ill-timed or in offensive taste: wanting to bite his own tongue for having made such a <I><FONT color=brown>maladroit</FONT></I> remark. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>gauche</FONT></I> might more commonly describe the whole picture someone presents socially, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>maladroit</FONT></I> more often refers to some particular ship or breach of taste.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tactless</FONT></B> is closer to maladroit than to <I><FONT color=brown>gauche</FONT></I>, but it may refer not only to a momentary slip but to an ingrained habit of being thoughtless or inconsiderate of the feelings of others: a <I><FONT color=brown>tactless</FONT></I> reference to her recent divorce; a thoroughly <I><FONT color=brown>tactless</FONT></I> person who never knew when to keep quiet. <B><FONT color=blue>Unpolished</FONT></B> concentrates on <I><FONT color=brown>gauche</FONT></I> behaviour that results specifically from a lack of good breeding or sophistication; the word, furthermore, is not necessarily negative in its evaluation: a man whose shoes and manners were both noticeable <I><FONT color=brown>unpolished</FONT></I>; an <I><FONT color=brown>unpolished</FONT></I> simplicity of speech that was refreshing after the affectations of his city friends. <B><FONT color=blue>Uncouth</FONT></B> stresses a total lack of social experience and sophistication, but with no mitigating possibilities for a positive evaluation. It also implies harsh, offensive, or rude behaviour: The <I><FONT color=brown>uncouth</FONT></I> manners of the waiter distressed her. <I><FONT color=brown>Uncouth</FONT></I> has an old-fashioned ring to it nowadays, and is often used with an undertone of irony at the expense of the excessively sensitive or snobbish: She regarded all men as vaguely <I><FONT color=brown>uncouth</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Boorish</FONT></B> is the harshest of all these words in its disapproval. The word makes no attempt to explain away disgusting or vile behaviour in terms of inexperience; it simply condemns. The word suggests manners that are fawning, sycophantic, surly or indelicate: a <I><FONT color=brown>boorish</FONT></I> lout who accosted her and insisted upon seeing her home.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clumsy">CLUMSY</A>, <A href="entry://Vulgar">VULGAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: adroit, <A href="entry://Considerate">CONSIDERATE</A>, <A href="entry://Polite">POLITE</A>, <A href="entry://Urbane">URBANE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to tasteless displays of overdone finery or decoration, or to brazen, flaunting behaviour. Of these words, <B><FONT color=blue>gaudy</FONT></B> is the least negative in tone, but still points to excessive use of decoration or to any sort of vividness that approaches vulgarity: <I><FONT color=brown>gaudy</FONT></I> make-up; the <I><FONT color=brown>gaudy</FONT></I> colours of the amusement park. The word may not imply disapproval at all in some circumstances, suggesting a wild or irresistible abandonment to spectacular designs: the <I><FONT color=brown>gaudy</FONT></I> lights of the carnival; the <I><FONT color=brown>gaudy</FONT></I> peacock. <B><FONT color=blue>Flashy</FONT></B> is an informal substitute for gaudy, referring to anything deliberately chosen out of exuberantly vulgar ostentation: <I><FONT color=brown>flashy</FONT></I> consume jewellery; a taste for <I><FONT color=brown>flashy</FONT></I> clothes that caused giggling fits among the other girls in the office. This word, too, can function without necessarily implying disapproval: a <I><FONT color=brown>flashy</FONT></I> sports car that was the envy of the whole neighbourhood; <I><FONT color=brown>flashy</FONT></I> beachwear designed for uninhibited summer fun.</P><P>With <B><FONT color=blue>garish</FONT></B>, the emphasis is wholly one extremely distasteful ostentation and more especially on a chaotic aesthetic effect resulting from the disharmony of elements in a total design: green eye shadow that would have been thought <I><FONT color=brown>garish</FONT></I> in a bordello; the <I><FONT color=brown>garish</FONT></I> combination of striped pants, plaid jacket and a clashing print shirt.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Meretricious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tawdry</FONT></B> both emphasize decoration that is made of cheap or worthless materials. With <I><FONT color=brown>meretricious</FONT></I>, the stress is on overuse, especially of spurious or trashy gimmicks: <I><FONT color=brown>meretricious</FONT></I> gewgaws that made the living-room look like a junk shop. The word has a special use to refer to aesthetic dishonesty or propaganda appeals: novels that make <I><FONT color=brown>meretricious</FONT></I> use of sex to boost sales; <I><FONT color=brown>meretricious</FONT></I> campaign promises. <I><FONT color=brown>Tawdry</FONT></I> may, most simply, suggest cheapness combined with showiness in taste: a <I><FONT color=brown>tawdry</FONT></I> plastic tablecloth; a <I><FONT color=brown>tawdry</FONT></I> flowered sofa already beginning to fall apart. Used less concretely, the word may suggest unsavouriness or such an extreme abasement of taste as to be degraded and degrading: <I><FONT color=brown>tawdry</FONT></I> hotel lounges where soldiers on leave could find girls on the loose; <I><FONT color=brown>tawdry</FONT></I> magazines that peddle filth, scandal and sleazy amusement to eager audiences.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Inexpensive">INEXPENSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Showy">SHOWY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Modest">MODEST</A>, plain, quiet, simple, tasteful.</P>

<P>These words all imply wide appeal, use, influence and the like. <B><FONT color=blue>General</FONT></B> means current among the majority of the persons, things or class specified: the <I><FONT color=brown>general</FONT></I> opinion. A <I><FONT color=brown>general</FONT></I> favourite is one widely liked. <B><FONT color=blue>Common</FONT></B> applies to many or a large part; a <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> belief is one widely shared. <B><FONT color=blue>Universal</FONT></B> applies to all or to the whole of a class of things; a <I><FONT color=brown>universal</FONT></I> truth holds in all instances. [It may be said that good health is a <I><FONT color=brown>general</FONT></I> condition, that occasional sickness is <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I>, and that death is <I><FONT color=brown>universal</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Accepted</FONT></B> means <I><FONT color=brown>commonly</FONT></I> recognized, believed or approved: Wearing a coat and tie to a good restaurant is an <I><FONT color=brown>accepted</FONT></I> convention. While accepted emphasizes willing compliance and approval, <B><FONT color=blue>popular</FONT></B>, as here considered, points to its etymological meaning, "of the people," i.e., the <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> people, and thus emphasizes source rather than extent of recognition: a <I><FONT color=brown>popular</FONT></I> myth that there is nothing to do in Melbourne on Sundays; Watching TV is a <I><FONT color=brown>popular</FONT></I> pastime.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Public</FONT></B> pertains to people at large or to the community. In its suggestion of an organized or quasi-organized body of people, <I><FONT color=brown>public</FONT></I> differs from the other words here considered. [<I><FONT color=brown>Public</FONT></I>-opinion polls indicate a <I><FONT color=brown>general</FONT></I> feeling among the people that <I><FONT color=brown>accepted</FONT></I> standards of behaviour are being deliberately flouted by long-haired hippies and the like.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Prevalent">PREVALENT</A>, <A href="entry://Sincere">SINCERE</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Queer">QUEER</A>, <A href="entry://Specific">SPECIFIC</A>, uncommon, <A href="entry://Unparalleled">UNPARALLELED</A>, <A href="entry://Unusual">UNUSUAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer either to a considerate, tolerant person who readily gives of himself or his money, or to large helpings or sizeable offerings. <B><FONT color=blue>Generous</FONT></B>, the most general, suggests kind concern and willingness to help others in tangible ways: a teacher <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I> with the time he devotes to after-class conferences; the <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I> habit of sharing his money with less fortunate friends. It can also suggest tolerance rather than narrow fault-finding: <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I> in his estimates of the plays he reviews. When used of a helping of food or an offer of any kind, it suggests an amount more than the receiver might have expected: a <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I> slice of beef; a <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I> offer to take a lower down-payment than usual. The word is sometimes used ironically to suggest its opposite: <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I> with his criticisms, frugal with his praise.</P><P>More formal than <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>magnanimous</FONT></B> is more likely to refer to well-intentioned kindness than to monetary generosity. In this sense, it may suggest courteous consideration given equally to everyone as a matter of principle, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I> is more likely to suggest a spontaneous impulse to help a particular person not so much out of principle as out of fondness: so <I><FONT color=brown>magnanimous</FONT></I> that he tended to forget that not everyone in the club shared his own unselfish motives for belonging. <I><FONT color=brown>Magnanimous</FONT></I>, in fact, can sometimes suggest an unconscious condescension or paternalism towards inferiors: giving <I><FONT color=brown>magnanimous</FONT></I> approval to her hopeless efforts at balancing their cheque account. <I><FONT color=brown>Magnanimous</FONT></I> would not be used to describe a <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I> serving, but, when used of an offer, it suggests restrained formality, possibly involving better terms than the receiver deserves: a <I><FONT color=brown>magnanimous</FONT></I> offer to buy the painting in spite of its imperfections.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bountiful</FONT></B> is still more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>magnanimous</FONT></I> and in the sense of generous is now mostly reserved for references to the Deity: <I><FONT color=brown>Bountiful</FONT></I> Lord. It occurs in a satiric phrase referring the charity that is condescending, self-righteous and smug: playing the lady <I><FONT color=brown>bountiful</FONT></I>. In more common uses, it suggests productivity, and is often used for rhetorical effect: a <I><FONT color=brown>bountiful</FONT></I> harvest; the <I><FONT color=brown>bountiful</FONT></I> land.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Liberal</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>lavish</FONT></B> most often refer to large servings or offers or to sizeable expenditure of money: a sundae with a <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> sprinkling of nuts; a <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> trade-in offer on your old car; a <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> spender. <I><FONT color=brown>Lavish</FONT></I> goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> in suggesting an excessive or unduly large amount or degree. In some senses it can excessive generosity adopted pretentiously for show: <I><FONT color=brown>lavish</FONT></I> displays of affection. In the stricter sense of <I><FONT color=brown>generous</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> can be used of a person, but here it suggests a permissive, easygoing nature: a doctor who was <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> about breaking rules when it might buck up a patient’s moral. Sometimes the word can even suggest carelessness or moral flabbiness: a <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> disregard for fine ethical distinctions.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Benevolence">BENEVOLENCE</A>, <A href="entry://Prevalent">PREVALENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: chary, <A href="entry://Greedy">GREEDY</A>, niggardly, parsimonious, selfish, sparing, tight.</P>

<P>These words all refer to innate or superior ability. <B><FONT color=blue>Genius</FONT></B>, the strongest word, is conceived as a mental power far beyond explanation in terms of heritage or education and manifests itself by exceptional originality and extraordinary intelligence, surpassing that of most intellectually superior people: the <I><FONT color=brown>genius</FONT></I> of Leonardo da Vinci, whose notebooks, written in the late 15<SUP>th</SUP> and early 16<SUP>th</SUP> centuries, include designs of flying machines, improvements in weaponry, and complicated labour-saving mechanical systems utilizing gears and pulleys, as well as detailed scientific observations in biology, geology and other subjects. <I><FONT color=brown>Genius</FONT></I> may be applied particularly to one area: the artistic <I><FONT color=brown>genius</FONT></I> of a Picasso, whose unique achievement assure him of a dominant place in the history of modern art.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>aptitude</FONT></B> is a natural or acquired ability to learn and become proficient, while a <B><FONT color=blue>faculty</FONT></B> is a particular mental skill or power. While <I><FONT color=brown>aptitude</FONT></I> suggests quickness in learning, often in gaining mastery of an academic discipline or artistic skill, <I><FONT color=brown>faculty</FONT></I> is at once more modest and more general in application, suggesting only an inherent attribute or skill. [He lacks completely the <I><FONT color=brown>faculty</FONT></I> of self-criticism; an early <I><FONT color=brown>aptitude</FONT></I> for mathematics; he demonstrated his <I><FONT color=brown>aptitude</FONT></I> for music by the ease with which he picked out melodies by ear.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Talent</FONT></B> is a particular and uncommon <I><FONT color=brown>aptitude</FONT></I> for some special work or activity; it is conceived of as an inborn resource that may or may not be developed. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>genius</FONT></I> applies to general intellectual or artistic superiority, <I><FONT color=brown>talent</FONT></I> is a specific natural endowment or <B><FONT color=blue>gift</FONT></B>: a <I><FONT color=brown>talent</FONT></I> for designing beautiful clothes for young women; a remarkable <I><FONT color=brown>talent</FONT></I> for staging and directing plays. <I><FONT color=brown>Genius</FONT></I> may also be used in the sense of special <I><FONT color=brown>aptitude</FONT></I>: to have a <I><FONT color=brown>genius</FONT></I> for turning a small investment into a successful business. <I><FONT color=brown>Gift</FONT></I> is akin to <I><FONT color=brown>genius</FONT></I> but on a lower plane: the <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> of a poet’s sensibility and verbal acumen. <I><FONT color=brown>Gift</FONT></I> emphasizes the inborn quality of a skill. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>talent</FONT></I>, gift does not necessarily imply creative ability, nor even originality: a <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> of intensely appreciating music; the <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> of enjoying life. <I><FONT color=brown>Gift</FONT></I> may apply to any striking or remarkable personal ability or power.</P><P>Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>faculty</FONT></I> is most often used positively when applied to an interpersonal quality, <I><FONT color=brown>talent</FONT></I>, and especially <I><FONT color=brown>genius</FONT></I>, being progressively more exaggerated and figurative in such contexts, are often used negatively and emphatically, sometimes with comical effect. [He has the <I><FONT color=brown>faculty</FONT></I> of saying the right thing at the right time; He has a <I><FONT color=brown>talent</FONT></I> for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time; He has a positive <I><FONT color=brown>genius</FONT></I> for putting his foot in his mouth.]</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>instinct</FONT></B>, as here considered, is a natural aptitude, in which sense it is really an extension of its basic psychobiological meaning referring to an animal’s innate tendency or response to act in ways that are essential to its development or preservation. <B><FONT color=blue>Instinct</FONT></B> usually implies innate disposition rather than <I><FONT color=brown>talent</FONT></I>. [Good salesmen know by instinct the best approach to take with a particular customer; He has the <I><FONT color=brown>instincts</FONT></I> of an athlete: he really goes all out to win.] <I><FONT color=brown>Instinct</FONT></I> can, however, be used of qualities that are not inborn but have been so thoroughly acquired that they seem as if they were: an <I><FONT color=brown>instinct</FONT></I> for making money; to develop an <I><FONT color=brown>instinct</FONT></I> for staying out of trouble. In this sense <I><FONT color=brown>instinct</FONT></I> is close to <B><FONT color=blue>knack</FONT></B>, which refers to an ability to do something readily and well; <I><FONT color=brown>knack</FONT></I> applies more often to social situations than to intellectual ones: a <I><FONT color=brown>knack</FONT></I> of knowing when to leave a party; Some people have the <I><FONT color=brown>knack</FONT></I> of being able to keep silent without making others feel ill at ease.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bent</FONT></B> refers to personal inclination or penchant; it does not necessarily imply an accompanying aptitude, but since it is human nature to like doing what one does well, aptitude and bent are often present in the same person. [My son has a mechanical <I><FONT color=brown>bent</FONT></I> ?he’s always tearing motors apart and putting them back together again; Politicians seldom have any aesthetic <I><FONT color=brown>bent</FONT></I>; From his earliest years he had a literary <I><FONT color=brown>bent</FONT></I>, but never showed much aptitude for writing creatively.] <I><FONT color=brown>Bent</FONT></I> often suggests devotion and industry: He demonstrated his <I><FONT color=brown>bent</FONT></I> for music by practising six hours a day.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Attainment">ATTAINMENT</A>, <A href="entry://Skill">SKILL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to coming into possession of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Get</FONT></B> is the most general of these, with a wide range of uses that includes every situation discussed here; it can apply as well to forceful seizure as to passive reception: The Mounties always <I><FONT color=brown>get</FONT></I> their man; <I><FONT color=brown>getting</FONT></I> the joke after everyone else in the room was in hysterics. The use of <I><FONT color=brown>get</FONT></I> in idiomatic phrases is, of course, manifold, and since some of these idioms may be informal, some feel the need to replace it wherever possible with <B><FONT color=blue>obtain</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Obtain</FONT></I> is certainly more formal, but as a mere substitute for get it often may sound high-flown or pretentious: <I><FONT color=brown>getting</FONT></I> her to sign the paper; <I><FONT color=brown>obtaining</FONT></I> her signature on the paper urging people over 40 to get a medical check-up; recommending that mature persons <I><FONT color=brown>obtain</FONT></I> a medical examination annually if not more frequently. <I><FONT color=brown>Obtain</FONT></I> is more precisely used in formal contexts where the stress is on the seeking out of something; here, get might not indicate clearly enough his intended meaning: an unmanned spacecraft that could <I><FONT color=brown>obtain</FONT></I> soil samples from the moon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gain</FONT></B> goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>obtain</FONT></I> to indicate greater effort in the seeking process; it can indicate forceful seizure, as in the military sense: <I><FONT color=brown>gaining</FONT></I> the victory after bloody battle. The word can also suggest an increase in something already possessed, or a piece-by-piece process of <I><FONT color=brown>obtaining</FONT></I> something: <I><FONT color=brown>gaining</FONT></I> additional honours with each new book he published; <I><FONT color=brown>gaining</FONT></I> ground on the speeding car. <B><FONT color=blue>Acquire</FONT></B> points to a piecemeal process of possession that is continuous and often slow: <I><FONT color=brown>acquiring</FONT></I> a controlling interest in the company over several years of stock purchases; assiduously <I><FONT color=brown>acquiring</FONT></I> a fine collection of impressionist paintings. As in these cases, the word is often used in a context of financial transactions. <I><FONT color=brown>Acquire</FONT></I> can also suggest the effort or exposure required to gain less tangible things, as in the learning process: wishing to <I><FONT color=brown>acquire</FONT></I> a speaking knowledge of French; surprised that he had actually <I><FONT color=brown>acquired</FONT></I> a taste for artichokes.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Procure</FONT></B> implies manoeuvring to posses something, suggesting involved, contrived or even shady dealings. Thus the word’s tone ranges from neutrality to disapproval: the complicated requisition forms by which the Ordnance Corps <I><FONT color=brown>procures</FONT></I> needed supplies; <I><FONT color=brown>procuring</FONT></I> favours through those closest to influential people. Most specifically, the word can pertain to the act of pimping, that is, <I><FONT color=brown>obtaining</FONT></I> women to gratify the lust of others: a man who <I><FONT color=brown>procured</FONT></I> prostitutes for sailors in waterfront bars. This meaning of the word is often present as an overtone in its other uses.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accumulate">ACCUMULATE</A>, <A href="entry://Come">COME</A>, <A href="entry://Reach">REACH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: give up, let go, lose, <A href="entry://Relinquish">RELINQUISH</A>.</P>

<P>These words all mean to hand over freely to another. To <B><FONT color=blue>give</FONT></B> is primarily to transfer to another’s possession without compensation, but he word also has many extended senses; a boxer <I><FONT color=brown>gives</FONT></I> a bow, a clock <I><FONT color=brown>gives</FONT></I> time, a delinquent child <I><FONT color=brown>gives</FONT></I> trouble. <I><FONT color=brown>Give</FONT></I> is the most general word in this group and may be used interchangeably with any of the other words listed in most contexts.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Award</FONT></B> usually implies that the thing given is deserved, and the giver is in some sense a judge.

<P>These words refer to dimly lit, unpleasant places or to pessimistic frames of mind. <B><FONT color=blue>Gloomy</FONT></B> is the most general of these words. In reference to places, it can suggest poor lighting: <I><FONT color=brown>gloomy</FONT></I> hallways where I had to grope my way. But now it more often suggests drabness: three <I><FONT color=brown>gloomy</FONT></I>, narrow rooms without a stick of furniture anywhere. In reference to a mental state, the word suggests someone who sees the hopeless side of any problem: his <I><FONT color=brown>gloomy</FONT></I> comments on the troubles they should have in clearing customs. In this context, the word has an overtone of criticism that suggests unnecessary worry. <B><FONT color=blue>Dreary</FONT></B> most appropriately describes drab surroundings rather than states of mind: escaping from a <I><FONT color=brown>dreary</FONT></I>, small-town existence. Used more loosely, the word is often meant to convey disapproval of a situation both tedious and sordid: the <I><FONT color=brown>dreary</FONT></I> machinations of corrupt politicians.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sombre</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>murky</FONT></B> may both describe dimly lit surroundings: a clouded moon that made the path <I><FONT color=brown>sombre</FONT></I> and forbidding; London streets made <I><FONT color=brown>murky</FONT></I> by fog. <I><FONT color=brown>Sombre</FONT></I>, however, is the one word here that may have positive overtones in suggesting a restrained despair or a subdued, stark simplicity of effect: his <I><FONT color=brown>sombre</FONT></I> acceptance of the bad news that stood in such sharp contrast to her wild, hysterical cries of self-pity; the novel’s <I><FONT color=brown>sombre</FONT></I> purity that removed it so decidedly from the charge of fashionable nihilism. The special overtones of <I><FONT color=brown>murky</FONT></I> suggest something clouded in confusing obscurity: motives that must always remain <I><FONT color=brown>murky</FONT></I> no matter how we attempt to reconstruct the actions of the killer.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dark</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>grey</FONT></B> suggest a literal dimness or a gloomy outlook: the <I><FONT color=brown>dark</FONT></I> house; the <I><FONT color=brown>dark</FONT></I> cast of his mind; another <I><FONT color=brown>grey</FONT></I> morning of mist and rain. In referring to states of mind, <I><FONT color=brown>grey</FONT></I> has a special overtone of dull, unrelieved sameness: the <I><FONT color=brown>grey</FONT></I> monotony of the days behind her, the grey stretch of days that still lay before her.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Break">BLEAK</A>, <A href="entry://Dismal">DISMAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bright">BRIGHT</A>, <A href="entry://Cheerful">CHEERFUL</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable when they mean to exhibit motion or other activity in a forward or upward direction or towards some specific goal. <B><FONT color=blue>Go</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>move</FONT></B> are the most general, and include among their implications the ideas of <B><FONT color=blue>advance</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rise</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Advance</FONT></I> is the most explicit in indicating a forward direction, and <I><FONT color=brown>rise</FONT></I> is the most explicit in indicating an upward direction. Thus, a platoon may be ordered to <I><FONT color=brown>go</FONT></I> or to <I><FONT color=brown>advance</FONT></I> to the top of the next hill.

<P>These words all denote writing or speech that suffers from an over-use of obscure, ponderous or meaningless words, or that is worthless and empty of significance.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gobbledygook</FONT></B> is confused or even unintelligible speech or writing, especially when it is used to express a simple idea. "Do not become involved in a colloquy with the bench, but proceed without undue delay to discharge your obligation for violation of the ordinance in question," is <I><FONT color=brown>gobbledygook</FONT></I> for "Don’t argue with the magistrate ?pay the fine."</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Officialese</FONT></B> is the <B><FONT color=blue>gobbledygook</FONT></B> found in legal, governmental, educational or other formal speech or writing. "There should be implementation to meet the unmet needs of that segment of society that is socially and economically oppressed and to provide motivation for mobility away from self-demeaning indigence and morale-destroying dependence," is <I><FONT color=brown>officialese</FONT></I> for "Let’s get those people off relief who are able to work." Both <I><FONT color=brown>gobbledygook</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>officialese</FONT></I> make communication difficult and dull without making it more accurate.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gibberish</FONT></B> emphasizes the unintelligibility of difficult or esoteric expression which may sometimes be <I><FONT color=brown>gobbledygook</FONT></I> or sometimes a terminology or a language with which one is unfamiliar. [Higher mathematics is <I><FONT color=brown>gibberish</FONT></I> to most people; The Ainus of Japan speak a <I><FONT color=brown>gibberish</FONT></I> unrelated to any other language; Those who follow the share market reports communicate in a <I><FONT color=brown>gibberish</FONT></I> all their own.]</P><P>In the context of this discussion <B><FONT color=blue>nonsense</FONT></B> stresses language that is absurd or that lacks meaning and common sense. <I><FONT color=brown>Nonsense</FONT></I> may suggest incorrect or irrelevant remarks arising from stupidity or ignorance: His comments in class are always <I><FONT color=brown>nonsense</FONT></I>. Or it may suggest deliberate playfulness in the use of language: Many children’s rhymes and play songs are charming <I><FONT color=brown>nonsense</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Claptrap</FONT></B> is a form of expression designed to attract and win popular approval by the use of cheap sensationalism or artifice. It stresses worthlessness and showiness: a piece of <I><FONT color=brown>claptrap</FONT></I> passing for a serious study of working-class life; an impassioned political speech full of <I><FONT color=brown>claptrap</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Garbage</FONT></B>, a slang term, carries stronger opprobrium than either <I><FONT color=brown>nonsense</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>claptrap</FONT></I> in that it is written or spoken language that is not only without merit but often objectionable.

<P>These words refer to people who have an intense interest in food. <B><FONT color=blue>Gourmet</FONT></B> indicates someone who is a connoisseur of good cooking and is knowledgeable and discriminating about the niceties of food preparation and serving. The word suggests a taste for elegance and concern for all aspects of the ritual of dining, including the selection of foods and wines that are thought to harmonize with each other: as much a <I><FONT color=brown>gourmet</FONT></I> of French as of Mexican or Chinese cuisine; thinking to pass himself off as a <I><FONT color=brown>gourmet</FONT></I> by criticizing the modest rosé she had chosen to accompany their seafood dinner. <B><FONT color=blue>Gastronome</FONT></B> is a more formal substitute for gourmet but, if anything, suggests even more expertise about everything pertaining to food: expatiating like a true <I><FONT color=brown>gastronome</FONT></I> on the effect to be obtained by spicing the filet with marjoram instead of thyme.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gourmand</FONT></B> suggests someone for whom the eating of food itself is the primary interest. Although the <I><FONT color=brown>gourmand</FONT></I> appreciates good cooking, he judges this more by its taste than by the canon of rules and regulations with which the <I><FONT color=brown>gourmet</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>gastronome</FONT></I> may be familiar; wives who treat their husbands like <I><FONT color=brown>gourmets</FONT></I> only to find them responding like <I><FONT color=brown>gourmands</FONT></I>; A <I><FONT color=brown>gourmand</FONT></I> must have originated the notion that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. A <B><FONT color=blue>trencherman</FONT></B> is similar to a <I><FONT color=brown>gourmand</FONT></I> but is more down to earth with his hearty appetite and enjoyment of eating: Bill will do the dinner justice ?he always was a good <I><FONT color=brown>trencherman</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Glutton</FONT></B> is in sharp contrast to all these words by suggesting a person totally indifferent to the fine points of cooking and perhaps even to the taste of the food he eats. The main emphasis here is on endless appetite and the devouring of food in quantities: food so tasteless and ill-prepared that it could appeal only to a starving man or a <I><FONT color=brown>glutton</FONT></I>. The word is often used with humorous intention to describe an insatiable craving for a particular food: hot spells that turn us into <I><FONT color=brown>gluttons</FONT></I> for ice cream and watermelon.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eat">EAT</A>.</P>

graphic
<B><FONT color=blue>graphic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pictorial</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>picturesque</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>vivid</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to things that have visual impact or are dramatically appealing. <B><FONT color=blue>Graphic</FONT></B> may refer as neutral description to work that uses the elements and techniques of visual design: training in all phases of the <I><FONT color=brown>graphic</FONT></I> arts. It also extends metaphorically to anything having the clarity and power of written, printed, diagrammatic or visualized illustration: a <I><FONT color=brown>graphic</FONT></I> lesson in the pitfalls of befriending strangers; photographs that not only illustrate the article but lend it <I><FONT color=brown>graphic</FONT></I> force; giving <I><FONT color=brown>graphic</FONT></I> examples of how the two theories conflict. <B><FONT color=blue>Vivid</FONT></B> is a much more general and less specific word than <I><FONT color=brown>graphic</FONT></I>. Most strictly it suggests forceful visual representation or the use of dramatic graphic elements, especially colour: the <I><FONT color=brown>vivid</FONT></I> colours of the painting; a self-portrait that was a <I><FONT color=brown>vivid</FONT></I> study of the sag and breakdown of flesh in old age. Vivid is, of course, used widely outside the visual arts for anything that has a heightened or concentrated dramatic impact: a speech denouncing his opponent in <I><FONT color=brown>vivid</FONT></I> terms; her <I><FONT color=brown>vivid</FONT></I> portrayal of Lady Macbeth.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pictorial</FONT></B> is often restricted to the neutrally descriptive aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>graphic</FONT></I>, referring to elements of visual design or to the fact that something is represented visually or contains pictures: pictorial magazines; a film director strong in handling the <I><FONT color=brown>pictorial</FONT></I> elements but weak in giving his story line any sense of momentum. It may also refer to something that calls up visual images: a fiction writer with a flair for <I><FONT color=brown>pictorial</FONT></I> description. <B><FONT color=blue>Picturesque</FONT></B> is more closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>vivid</FONT></I> in stressing things having a dramatic visual impact. The special tone of the word often suggests that a scene is thought striking because it is panoramic, quaint, strange or unusual in some other way: Uccello’s <I><FONT color=brown>picturesque</FONT></I> battle tableaux; the <I><FONT color=brown>picturesque</FONT></I> minarets of Istanbul; a <I><FONT color=brown>picturesque</FONT></I> ride in a Venetian gondola.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Drawing">DRAWING</A>, <A href="entry://Portray">PORTRAY</A>.</P>

grasp
<B><FONT color=blue>grasp</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>clasp</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>clutch</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>grab</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>grip</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>seize</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>snatch</FONT></B>:

<P>These verbs express the action of laying hold of things with the hands. To <B><FONT color=blue>grasp</FONT></B> is to take hold of firmly: He reached out, grasped my hand, and shook it. To <B><FONT color=blue>seize</FONT></B> is to take hold of suddenly, with force. [The hawk <I><FONT color=brown>seized</FONT></I> its prey with its talons; He <I><FONT color=brown>seized</FONT></I> the reins of the runaway horse.] Both <I><FONT color=brown>seize</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> are general in application and may be used figuratively as well as literally. [I don’t <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> your meaning; The army <I><FONT color=brown>seized</FONT></I> power.] <B><FONT color=blue>Grab</FONT></B> is more informal suggesting roughness in <I><FONT color=brown>seizing</FONT></I> or undue haste in getting hold of something. [He <I><FONT color=brown>grabbed</FONT></I> her arm and pulled her out of the path of the car; You may have a sweet, but don’t <I><FONT color=brown>grab</FONT></I>.] In some contexts, both <I><FONT color=brown>grab</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> may imply greed. [She was greedy and <I><FONT color=brown>grasping</FONT></I>; When her uncle died, she <I><FONT color=brown>grabbed</FONT></I> everything she could get her hands on.] To <B><FONT color=blue>snatch</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>grab</FONT></I> abruptly, with a sudden jerk; but where one may sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>grab</FONT></I> with the arms in order to hold, one <I><FONT color=brown>snatches</FONT></I> with the hands in order to take away. [Instead of <I><FONT color=brown>grabbing</FONT></I> her, the thief <I><FONT color=brown>snatched</FONT></I> her purse and ran.] When both <I><FONT color=brown>snatch</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>grab</FONT></I> mean to take, <I><FONT color=brown>snatch</FONT></I> implies greater haste and violence, suggesting urgency or desperation: Ravenous, he <I><FONT color=brown>snatched</FONT></I> the food out of my hands. <I><FONT color=brown>Snatch</FONT></I> may express the <I><FONT color=brown>seizing</FONT></I> of something one has no right to, but this is not always the case. Still, the haste of a person who <I><FONT color=brown>snatches</FONT></I> is often prompted by fear of consequences, whether he acts from good motives or bad. [She <I><FONT color=brown>snatched</FONT></I> the matches away from the child; The fireman <I><FONT color=brown>snatched</FONT></I> up the baby and carried him out of the burning house.] Both <I><FONT color=brown>snatch</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>grab</FONT></I> are also used in a more informal sense, meaning to get in what little time is available: to <I><FONT color=brown>grab</FONT></I> a bite to eat before the show; to <I><FONT color=brown>snatch</FONT></I> a few hours of sleep between performances.</P><P>Where <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>grab</FONT></I> mean to take hold of, <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>grip</FONT></B> mean to hold. A person <I><FONT color=brown>grasps</FONT></I> with a firm but moderate closure of the whole hand. He <I><FONT color=brown>grips</FONT></I> with the strongest muscular closure of the hand that he can exert. To <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> is to hold firmly; to <I><FONT color=brown>grip</FONT></I> is to hold tight. [He <I><FONT color=brown>gripped</FONT></I> my hand so tightly it hurt; He <I><FONT color=brown>gripped</FONT></I> the railing to pull himself up.] <B><FONT color=blue>Clasp</FONT></B> may mean to <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> firmly in or with the hand: The children <I><FONT color=brown>clasped</FONT></I> hands and formed a circle. Or <I><FONT color=brown>clasp</FONT></I> may mean to hold in the arms in an encircling embrace: The child <I><FONT color=brown>clasped</FONT></I> her doll protectively. A person <I><FONT color=brown>clasps</FONT></I> or <B><FONT color=blue>clutches</FONT></B> something to prevent its escape or removal; but as <I><FONT color=brown>grip</FONT></I> implies a stronger <I><FONT color=brown>grasping</FONT></I>, so <I><FONT color=brown>clutch</FONT></I> implies a stronger <I><FONT color=brown>clasping</FONT></I>: She <I><FONT color=brown>clutched</FONT></I> the doll tenaciously. <I><FONT color=brown>Clutch</FONT></I> may mean simply to <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> and hold firmly: the roots that <I><FONT color=brown>clutch</FONT></I>. Or both <I><FONT color=brown>clutch</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I>, when followed by <I><FONT color=brown>at</FONT></I>, may mean to try to get hold of. A drowning man <I><FONT color=brown>clutches</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>grasps</FONT></I>) <I><FONT color=brown>at</FONT></I> straws. But <I><FONT color=brown>clutch</FONT></I> implies a greater eagerness or urgency than <I><FONT color=brown>grasp</FONT></I> and may suggest downright desperation. Whether holding tight or only trying for a firm hold, the person who <I><FONT color=brown>clutches</FONT></I> feels frighteningly insecure. [She <I><FONT color=brown>clutched</FONT></I> her purse tightly, fearing that a thief might <I><FONT color=brown>snatch</FONT></I> it; He <I><FONT color=brown>clutched</FONT></I> at my arm as he fell.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Capture">CAPTURE</A>, <A href="entry://Carry">CARRY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: abandon, loose, release, relinquish.</P>

grateful
<B><FONT color=blue>grateful</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>appreciative</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>thankful</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all indicate worm feelings or expression s of gratitude. <B><FONT color=blue>Grateful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>thankful</FONT></B> are close in meaning, but one distinction is commonly observed in that <I><FONT color=brown>grateful</FONT></I> is used to describe our feelings of gratitude to another person, and <I><FONT color=brown>thankful</FONT></I> refers to similar feelings towards divine providence, fate, or some less immediate agency. One is <I><FONT color=brown>grateful</FONT></I> for a gift or a kind word, but <I><FONT color=brown>thankful</FONT></I> for good health or fair weather. <B><FONT color=blue>Appreciative</FONT></B>, more than the other two words, indicates a demonstration of the gratitude a person feels: a secretary who was so <I><FONT color=brown>appreciative</FONT></I> of the opportunity for advancement offered to her that she worked overtime even when not asked to do so.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Approval">APPROVAL</A>, <A href="entry://Endorse">ENDORSE</A>, <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: indifferent, ungrateful.</P>

<P>These words refer to people distinguished either by social standing or by accomplishment. <B><FONT color=blue>Great</FONT></B> is them sot general and informal of these words and has a wide range of uses outside this context. Here, it may refer to groups that possess wealth, influence or position: the Sforza, Medici and other <I><FONT color=brown>great</FONT></I> families of Renaissance Italy. Or it may refer to an accomplished person or his accomplishments: a <I><FONT color=brown>great</FONT></I> composer; Newton’s <I><FONT color=brown>great</FONT></I> discovery. The word is more far-reaching in the latter sense, since it implies that accomplishment has been critically evaluated or tested by time in light of its contribution to art, knowledge or human well-being. The social sense of the word, by contrast, merely implies the winning of status in a constricted or transitory sphere.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Reputable</FONT></B>, while much more formal, functions like <I><FONT color=brown>great</FONT></I> in both ways. In either case, it may point to mere acceptance or absence of fault rather than the genuine brilliance of a person or his work in its own right; a <I><FONT color=brown>reputable</FONT></I> middle-class family of merchants; a <I><FONT color=brown>reputable</FONT></I> scholar, a bit on the dry side; a <I><FONT color=brown>reputable</FONT></I> but outdated work on the subject. The word implies approval by those in a position to know rather than far-reaching fame; this makes it the mildest of the words here. <B><FONT color=blue>Illustrious</FONT></B>, the strongest term here, shows the sharpest possible contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>reputable</FONT></I>, since it always suggests fame or glory. The word is mostly restricted to the accomplished or their accomplishments and may not necessarily indicate a <I><FONT color=brown>reputable</FONT></I> person at all: <I><FONT color=brown>illustrious</FONT></I> deeds; an <I><FONT color=brown>illustrious</FONT></I> poet who scandalized the reputable upper classes of his day. When used in the context of social standing, the word usually applies to people who have added brilliant accomplishments to wealth, status or rank: an <I><FONT color=brown>illustrious</FONT></I> family that gave England some of its finest generals, statesmen and thinkers over several centuries.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Notable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>noteworthy</FONT></B> are somewhat stronger in tone than <I><FONT color=brown>reputable</FONT></I>, but both apply more exclusively to accomplished people or to their accomplishments. Both words would seem to point to something that merits attention, but in practice <I><FONT color=brown>notable</FONT></I> indicates those people or things that are actually known, respected or admired, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>noteworthy</FONT></I> indicates what is worthy of attention but may not yet have received it: several <I><FONT color=brown>notable</FONT></I> authors whose latest books are in the publisher’s hands; the only critic to single out the book as a <I><FONT color=brown>noteworthy</FONT></I> attempt despite its failure. Also, as can be seen, <I><FONT color=brown>notable</FONT></I> often suggests successful achievement, <I><FONT color=brown>noteworthy</FONT></I> a promising effort.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Eminent</FONT></B> is considerably stronger in emphasis than all the preceding words except <I><FONT color=brown>illustrious</FONT></I>. Here, the word functions equally well in the contexts both of social status and of accomplishment: people <I><FONT color=brown>eminent</FONT></I> enough to be listed in "Who’s who"; an <I><FONT color=brown>eminent</FONT></I> scientist. The word has a dignified tone, suggesting solid, well-respected values, and points to the most admired members of a given class. This makes the word less pertinent to the arts than to the academic disciplines, the sciences or the learned professions: an <I><FONT color=brown>illustrious</FONT></I> painter; an <I><FONT color=brown>eminent</FONT></I> critic; an <I><FONT color=brown>eminent</FONT></I> Supreme Court judge. <I><FONT color=brown>Pre-eminent</FONT></I> is a superlative for eminent, indicating that person who is the most respected of an already admired group. It also tends to suggest a position of great power and authority: the <I><FONT color=brown>pre-eminent</FONT></I> moulder of taste in his era. Neither of this pair is likely to be used in description of some accomplishment itself. Moreover, both words in emphasizing respectability do not approach illustrious in suggesting widespread renown. A person might be <I><FONT color=brown>eminent</FONT></I>, even <I><FONT color=brown>pre-eminent</FONT></I> in his field, and still not be in any way <I><FONT color=brown>illustrious</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Famous">FAMOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Outstanding">OUTSTANDING</A>, <A href="entry://Significant">SIGNIFICANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: obscure, unknown.</P>

<P>These words describe various kinds of insatiable desire for food, money, power or material possessions. <B><FONT color=blue>Greedy</FONT></B> is the most general word and is less formal than some of the other terms in this group. Although greedy can refer to a desire for money, power or property, it more commonly relates specifically to an inordinate desire for food. [She stuffed one chocolate after another into that <I><FONT color=brown>greedy</FONT></I> mouth of hers; <I><FONT color=brown>Greedy</FONT></I> for land, speculators laid waste the virgin forests.] <I><FONT color=brown>Greedy</FONT></I> less readily suggests the use of unethical means in seeking satisfaction: Unless you discipline <I><FONT color=brown>greedy</FONT></I> child, he may grow up to be a selfish adult.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Avaricious</FONT></B> is a more formal term than <I><FONT color=brown>greedy</FONT></I> and suggests an unbalanced, almost fanatic desire for money or possessions: The <I><FONT color=brown>avaricious</FONT></I> child lost his toys as soon as he got them, but still cried for more. The overtones possible in <I><FONT color=brown>avaricious</FONT></I> relate it to three much more informal words, <B><FONT color=blue>gluttonous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stingy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>miserly</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Gluttonous</FONT></I> puts the emphasis on consumption, most commonly of food. [His <I><FONT color=brown>gluttonous</FONT></I> appetite made short work of all the left-overs in the refrigerator.] <I><FONT color=brown>Stingy</FONT></I> emphasizes a lack of generosity, especially the reluctance to spend money. [She was so <I><FONT color=brown>stingy</FONT></I> that she never tipped a taxi driver.] <I><FONT color=brown>Miserly</FONT></I> refers more to the hoarding of money or property than to either the <I><FONT color=brown>gluttonous</FONT></I> consumption or the stingy use of it. [Their <I><FONT color=brown>miserly</FONT></I> piling up of wealth had not made up for their inability to have children.] An <I><FONT color=brown>avaricious</FONT></I> person may be either <I><FONT color=brown>gluttonous</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>miserly</FONT></I>, depending on whether he consumes or merely possess his wealth. In either case, he may or may not be <I><FONT color=brown>stingy</FONT></I> when he does use it. Of these four words, <I><FONT color=brown>avaricious</FONT></I> perhaps carries the strongest suggestion of being willing to use unethical means to satisfy a given desire. [The <I><FONT color=brown>avaricious</FONT></I> solicitor had cheated his own parents out of the title to their land.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Acquisitive</FONT></B> is considerably more neutral in tone than any of these words. It suggests the actual process of coming into the possession of goods whether by fair means or foul. In being more externally descriptive, it puts the emphasis on the act rather than on the desire. A poor person might desire possessions, but he is not actually <I><FONT color=brown>acquisitive</FONT></I> until, by some means, he begins to assemble them. [Thoreau argues that our <I><FONT color=brown>acquisitive</FONT></I> tendencies prevent us from living unburdened, joyous lives.] In contrast to the neutrality of <I><FONT color=brown>acquisitive</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>rapacious</FONT></B> is the most strongly negative of all these words. It blurs together desire and act, with overtones of brutality and violence. It emphasizes the taking of things against the will of others, by force or unethical means. [He was so <I><FONT color=brown>rapacious</FONT></I> in his lust for money that he impoverished whole families at a time.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Envious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>covetous</FONT></B> are opposed to <I><FONT color=brown>avaricious</FONT></I> and especially to <I><FONT color=brown>acquisitive</FONT></I> in suggesting more the intense desire for something than the act of possessing it. The desired item, furthermore, must necessarily belong to someone else. <I><FONT color=brown>Envious</FONT></I> implies the greater passivity of the two, referring to a hostile or inverted admiration for the belongings of another. Sometimes the very impossibility of possessing them is the key. [She would always be <I><FONT color=brown>envious</FONT></I> of her sister’s beauty.] <I><FONT color=brown>Covetous</FONT></I> is the more intense of the two and the less passive, shading off towards <I><FONT color=brown>avaricious</FONT></I> in its potential for being acted upon.

<P>These words all refer to inviting or complainant attitudes towards other people, and are alike in suggesting either an openness or willingness to make the acquaintance of others. In its broadest sense, <B><FONT color=blue>gregarious</FONT></B> is applied to animals as well as people. It involves a basic tendency to associate with one’s fellows, implying a natural disposition for group living: Men and sheep are both <I><FONT color=brown>gregarious</FONT></I> animals. In another sense, <I><FONT color=brown>gregarious</FONT></I> applies to people who actively seek the society of others, preferring company to solitude, but even in this sense the implication of wanting to be with others of one’s own kind is present: students who are so <I><FONT color=brown>gregarious</FONT></I> they are unable to spend a single evening alone for the sake of their studies. On the other hand, the more dialectal or "folksy" term, <B><FONT color=blue>sociable</FONT></B>, implies the seeking of a personal acquaintanceship, often in conformity with one of the prevailing cultural mores: a housewife who considers it <I><FONT color=brown>sociable</FONT></I> to invite a new neighbour in for morning coffee with the other women in the street. <B><FONT color=blue>Social</FONT></B> is more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>sociable</FONT></I>, and applies more often in this sense to an individual’s temperament than to an event, often defining one aspect of a person: the <I><FONT color=brown>social</FONT></I> side of his character; She’s become very <I><FONT color=brown>social</FONT></I> lately, giving at least one party a month. When applied to temperament, <B><FONT color=blue>outgoing</FONT></B> is akin to social but more often suggests a sociological context: an <I><FONT color=brown>outgoing</FONT></I> personality. <I><FONT color=brown>Outgoing</FONT></I> indicates a person who is not indrawn, inhibited or shy, but on the contrary one who expresses himself openly and makes acquaintances easily. Because such traits are attractive to most people, <I><FONT color=brown>outgoing</FONT></I> is often linked with other favourable terms: a sweet, <I><FONT color=brown>outgoing</FONT></I> child; a pleasant, warm, <I><FONT color=brown>outgoing</FONT></I> teacher.</P><P>Where the preceding words focus on the active individual whose social antennae "go out" to other people, <B><FONT color=blue>affable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>amiable</FONT></B> indicate receptivity or accessibility to the gestures of others. Etymologically, <I><FONT color=brown>affable</FONT></I> means capable of being spoken to, i.e., easy to approach. It suggests a benign and courteous attitude rather than one actively seeking new friends; The easy, <I><FONT color=brown>affable</FONT></I> manner of the lecturer endeared him to his audience. <I><FONT color=brown>Amiable</FONT></I> has more of a note of kindliness, and suggests an openness to friendship. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>affable</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>amiable</FONT></I> may also refer to a disagreement or dispute that is free from antagonism or ill feeling: An <I><FONT color=brown>amiable</FONT></I> rivalry existed between the two old friends.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Friendly</FONT></B> has a wide variety of applications. It may , like <I><FONT color=brown>amiable</FONT></I>, mean free from ill feeling: a <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I> argument. It may mean acting as or typical of a friend: <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I> advice; Inviting us to stay the night was a <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I> and hospitable gesture. <I><FONT color=brown>Friendly</FONT></I> may suggest an openness to a personal or intimate relationship based on the individual natures or interests of the people concerned; in this sense it differs from the more impersonal <I><FONT color=brown>amiable</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>affable</FONT></I> and the less individually-oriented <I><FONT color=brown>gregarious</FONT></I>. [She was <I><FONT color=brown>gregarious</FONT></I> but not <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I>; she liked to be surrounded by crowds and admirers but assiduously avoided personal relationships with any of them; He was an <I><FONT color=brown>amiable</FONT></I> sort ?never said a harsh word about anyone ?but no one ever got very <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I> with him; Einstein had an <I><FONT color=brown>affable</FONT></I> nature, quick to appreciate wit and with considerable personal charm, but he was nevertheless known intimately by very few, and could not be called <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I>.] But <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I> is also used more broadly to refer to kindliness in people and to the absence of antagonism or menace in animals. [He was a <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I> fellow, always ready to lend a helping hand when needed; The dog seemed <I><FONT color=brown>friendly</FONT></I> enough until I tried to pet him.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cordial</FONT></B> means warm and hearty, and suggests sincerity of feeling as well; it is nowadays used most often of formal situations rather than personal ones involving the private lives of individuals: A <I><FONT color=brown>cordial</FONT></I> welcome was accorded the visiting minister of state; a <I><FONT color=brown>cordial</FONT></I> greeting. Its formal context and tone should not be interpreted as somehow vitiating the sincerity of feeling the word connotes; it simply suggest a formal but genuine expression of feeling: a long and <I><FONT color=brown>cordial</FONT></I> relationship between the violinist and his protégé.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Blithe">BLITHE</A>, <A href="entry://Compliant">COMPLIANT</A>, <A href="entry://Friend">FRIEND</A>, <A href="entry://Loving">LOVING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aloof">ALOOF</A>, anti-social, <A href="entry://Hostile">HOSTILE</A>, introverted, retiring, unapproachable, unsociable.</P>

grieve
<B><FONT color=blue>grieve</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lament</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mourn</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sorrow</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the inward feeling or active expression of unhappiness at a bereavement, failure or loss. <B><FONT color=blue>Grieve</FONT></B> ahs the widest range of expressiveness, concentrating on though or feeling. It implies inner anguish that may or may not be openly expressed: giving no sign that he had spent the morning <I><FONT color=brown>grieving</FONT></I> over his failure to win promotion; surprised at how many attended the funeral to <I><FONT color=brown>grieve</FONT></I> over the death of their friend. <B><FONT color=blue>Mourn</FONT></B> is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>grieve</FONT></I> but is more formal. In its most solemn sense, it implies deep emotion felt over a period of time: privately <I><FONT color=brown>mourning</FONT></I> his mother’s death. But the word is often used for a public show of bereavement that may or may not be sincere but is often ceremonial or ritualized; to wear black as a symbol of <I><FONT color=brown>mourning</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lament</FONT></B> comes from the Latin word for wailing or weeping. It specifically suggests giving vocal or verbal expression to a sense of loss or bereavement: loudly <I><FONT color=brown>lamenting</FONT></I> the loss of his job; <I><FONT color=brown>lamenting</FONT></I> her husband’s tragic death with uncontrolled seizures of hysterical weeping. The word is sometimes used in a less serious sense to indicate someone who tediously verbalizes trivial disappointments: <I><FONT color=brown>lamenting</FONT></I> to all his friends about how unfairly the teacher had treated him. <B><FONT color=blue>Sorrow</FONT></B> may suggest milder feelings or a less tragic loss than the foregoing words; it combines sadness with regret, contrasting with lament by suggesting grieving that is inward or, at most, quietly expressed: <I><FONT color=brown>sorrowing</FONT></I> over all their missed chances to get to know each other better. In some contexts, <I><FONT color=brown>sorrow</FONT></I> as a verb may sound faintly outdated. <I><FONT color=brown>Grieve</FONT></I> contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>sorrow</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>lament</FONT></I> in that it may apply to a forlorn animal as well as to a human being: a man <I><FONT color=brown>sorrowing</FONT></I> for weeks over the death of his dog; a dog <I><FONT color=brown>grieving</FONT></I> over the death of its master.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deplore">DEPLORE</A>, <A href="entry://Miserable">MISERABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Weep">WEEP</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: exult, jubilate, rejoice.</P>

<P>These words refer to what is repellently ugly or extremely distasteful. <B><FONT color=blue>Gruesome</FONT></B> may be used as a hyperbole for anything evoking such a response: a woman dressed in simply <I><FONT color=brown>gruesome</FONT></I> taste. More precisely the word refers to spectacles of physical violence, or an unhealthy interest in such things: the <I><FONT color=brown>gruesome</FONT></I> atrocities committed by both sides in the tribal wars; <I><FONT color=brown>gruesome</FONT></I> murders that suggested a psychopathic killer; the <I><FONT color=brown>gruesome</FONT></I> delight with which some newspapers played up the tragedy. <B><FONT color=blue>Grisly</FONT></B> is very close to <I><FONT color=brown>gruesome</FONT></I>, but is more intense in suggesting destructive violence that springs from a brutally sadistic or abnormal mind. It would, thus, apply less to impersonal destruction on a mass scale, such as might result in war: <I><FONT color=brown>grisly</FONT></I> indications that he had played cat and with which unspeakable experiments were performed on human subjects; a <I><FONT color=brown>grisly</FONT></I> interest in descriptions of deviant sexual behaviour. The word can have comic force in referring to excessively laboured or vivid accounts of a clandestine nature: eager to tell everyone the <I><FONT color=brown>grisly</FONT></I> details of her neighbour’s divorce.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hideous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ghastly</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>grim</FONT></B> are much less specific than the previous pair. Each is popularly used as a hyperbole. <I><FONT color=brown>Hideous</FONT></I> often has reference to extreme deformation or ugliness and <I><FONT color=brown>ghastly</FONT></I> to something frightening or filled with horror: a car accident that left <I><FONT color=brown>hideous</FONT></I> scars on his face: the <I><FONT color=brown>ghastly</FONT></I> realization that she had lost her way in the forest. <I><FONT color=brown>Ghastly</FONT></I> has a more specific reference to a ghostlike or deathlike pallor, or one resulting form fear: a <I><FONT color=brown>ghastly</FONT></I> face that spoke of the harrowing experience she had suffered. <I><FONT color=brown>Grim</FONT></I> suggests something stern or forbidding, even to the point of being terrifying: the <I><FONT color=brown>grim</FONT></I> aftermath of the abortive rebellion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lurid</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>ghastly</FONT></I>, may suggest an extremely pale appearance: a face lurid with fear and shock. Paradoxically, the word also suggests redness such as produced by a smoky fire: the <I><FONT color=brown>lurid</FONT></I> torches of the enraged townsmen gathering in the courtyard. More generally, the word refers to anything <I><FONT color=brown>hideous</FONT></I> in its vividness: the <I><FONT color=brown>lurid</FONT></I> marks of the whip across his back. The word has special use to refer to <I><FONT color=brown>gruesome</FONT></I> or sensational verbal descriptions or pictorial treatment: <I><FONT color=brown>lurid</FONT></I> accounts of the carnage left by the two-day battle; <I><FONT color=brown>lurid</FONT></I> photographs of the plane crash. <B><FONT color=blue>Macabre</FONT></B> refers specifically to horror-inspiring ideas or spectacles of any kind, without necessarily pointing to physical destruction of any sort: the <I><FONT color=brown>macabre</FONT></I> sexual exploits attributed to witches. <I><FONT color=brown>Macabre</FONT></I> is derived etymologically from danse <I><FONT color=brown>macabre</FONT></I>, dance of death, and suggests a <I><FONT color=brown>gruesome</FONT></I> and frequently bizarre interest in or connection with death: <I><FONT color=brown>macabre</FONT></I> tales of blood-sucking vampires, zombies and other supernatural phenomena; the routine but nonetheless <I><FONT color=brown>macabre</FONT></I> preparation of a condemned prisoner for electrocution.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bizarre">BIZARRE</A>, <A href="entry://Repulsive">REPULSIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Charming">CHARMING</A>, delightful, <A href="entry://Pleasing">PLEASING</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to the action of showing the way to something or someone. <B><FONT color=blue>Guide</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>conduct</FONT></B> mean to accompany in order to show the way to a destination. <I><FONT color=brown>Guide</FONT></I> usually indicates a close or personal relationship or a joint effort between the two parties, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I> stresses the fact of escorting and the unequal relationship between the two parties; <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I> may even imply helplessness or coercion.

guile
<B><FONT color=blue>guile</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>craft</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cunning</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>duplicity</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the clever or perceptive manipulation of facts, appearances or people in order to attain a goal. <B><FONT color=blue>Guile</FONT></B> suggests a wily and shrewd person who uses subterfuge and stratagems to get his way: Don’t try to match your inexperience with the <I><FONT color=brown>guile</FONT></I> of an unscrupulous antique dealer. At its mildest, the word can indicate approval, if not admiration, for a clever person who has learned that indirect means are the only effective ones in some complex situation: the old prospector’s <I><FONT color=brown>guile</FONT></I> in eluding those who tried to track him back to the spot where he had discovered gold. When <B><FONT color=blue>cunning</FONT></B> is used with approval, it puts a greater stress on intellectual prowess than on subtlety born of experience: The detective had used all the <I><FONT color=brown>cunning</FONT></I> at his command to arrive at the murderer’s identity. When it is negative, <I><FONT color=brown>cunning</FONT></I> is a harsher word than <I><FONT color=brown>guile</FONT></I>; in this case its stress is on ferocity or single-minded obsessiveness. It is often used, literally or metaphorically, in reference to animals: sheer animal <I><FONT color=brown>cunning</FONT></I>; a man who had the <I><FONT color=brown>cunning</FONT></I> of a wolf.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Duplicity</FONT></B> is less ambiguous in its application; it is always negative and refers either to underhanded double-dealing or to outright lying, in which case it may have a euphemistic flavour: price fixers who practise <I><FONT color=brown>duplicity</FONT></I> to cheat the public; She admitted that she had been guilty of <I><FONT color=brown>duplicity</FONT></I> in saying she had another engagement that evening. <B><FONT color=blue>Craft</FONT></B> is most like guile in suggesting someone accustomed to using indirect means to get his way. But the word is less often used than the first pair, except in phrases that link it with one or the other: a man capable of incredible <I><FONT color=brown>craft</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>cunning</FONT></I>; The best poker players are those for whom <I><FONT color=brown>craft</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>guile</FONT></I> seem to be almost second nature.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheat">CHEAT</A>, <A href="entry://Deception">DECEPTION</A>, <A href="entry://Trick">TRICK</A> (n.) <A href="entry://Trick">TRICK</A> (v.).</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: artlessness, candour, ingenuousness.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>gullible</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>credulous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>naïve</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>trusting</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a readiness to believe what one is told. Gullible emphasizes that a person can be easily tricked or cheated; credulous is less intense, suggesting simply a willingness to believe on slight evidence, without implying the presence of trickery in presenting the evidence. Gullible might suggest the greedy hope of getting something for nothing, so easily exploited by confidence men. Credulous might more appropriately suggest religious or superstitious persuasion that does not necessarily result in material gain for either the persuader or persuaded. A credulous person, furthermore, might be brought to believe something without acting upon it to his own harm, whereas a gullible person’s belief, by implication, causes him to act in a foolish way that injures himself or others. [Hamlet fears being credulous of the host’s story ?he must corroborate it; Shakespeare’s audience saw Othello less as a jealous man than as a gullible one, easily duped by Iago’s machinations.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Trusting</FONT></B> suggests the same willingness to believe as <I><FONT color=brown>gullible</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>credulous</FONT></I>, but ranges from neutrality of tone to one of approval: a <I><FONT color=brown>trusting</FONT></I> girl alone in the big city; a people so <I><FONT color=brown>trusting</FONT></I> in the guarantees of a future life as to be unshakably free from all temptation. <I><FONT color=brown>Naïve</FONT></I>, on the other hand, suggests an inexperienced optimism, an unawareness of the compromises life entails. A <I><FONT color=brown>naïve</FONT></I> person is certainly <I><FONT color=brown>trusting</FONT></I>; he is also likely to be <I><FONT color=brown>credulous</FONT></I>; he would, furthermore, be thought <I><FONT color=brown>gullible</FONT></I> by the sophisticate. <I><FONT color=brown>Naïve</FONT></I> suggests an untried or untested person rather than one necessarily <I><FONT color=brown>gullible</FONT></I>. Only when the <I><FONT color=brown>naïve</FONT></I> person has made a fool of himself by permitting himself to be tricked does he actually become <I><FONT color=brown>gullible</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: NAÏVE.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: critical, disbelieving, doubtful, dubious, questioning, sceptical.</P>

<P>These words refer to states of well-being or to the pleasurable satisfaction that accompanies such states. <B><FONT color=blue>Happiness</FONT></B> is the most general term and may imply any degree of well-being from that of mere contentment or absence of sorrow to the most intense joy and sense of fulfilment. <B><FONT color=blue>Felicity</FONT></B> is a more formal and less often used term for great and sustained happiness: All men by nature seek ease of mind, but few can hope for unending <I><FONT color=brown>felicity</FONT></I>. The word is most often used of a happy faculty for an effective manner or style: a <I><FONT color=brown>felicity</FONT></I> of poetic expression.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gladness</FONT></B> is overflowing <I><FONT color=brown>happiness</FONT></I> and suggests an emotional reaction to a pleasant event, rather than a sustained state of mind: Her <I><FONT color=brown>gladness</FONT></I> at seeing us again was most touching.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bliss</FONT></B> in its commonest meaning points to complete, ecstatic happiness or to great contentment: the <I><FONT color=brown>bliss</FONT></I> of a young couple in love; the <I><FONT color=brown>bliss</FONT></I> experienced by a cat stretching in the sun. In the religious sense, bliss is a state of absolute <I><FONT color=brown>felicity</FONT></I> brought about by the submergence of the self into a divine infinity, as in the state of nirvana in Buddhism.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Blessedness</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>beatitude</FONT></B> usually refer to intense spiritual <I><FONT color=brown>bliss</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Blessedness</FONT></I> implies a happiness so profound as to be attributed to a deity or to unusually favourable fortune. <I><FONT color=brown>Beatitude</FONT></I>, a more formal and literary word, is supreme <I><FONT color=brown>blessedness</FONT></I> that approaches the transcendent. Its most familiar use is its application to the eight declarations of <I><FONT color=brown>blessedness</FONT></I> (the <I><FONT color=brown>Beatitude</FONT></I>) occurring in the Sermon on the Mount in the New Testament.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Joyous">JOYOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Pleasure">PLEASURE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: grief, <A href="entry://Misery">MISERY</A>, sadness, sorrow, unhappiness.</P>

<P>These words refer to efforts not easily made or to problems not easily solved. <B><FONT color=blue>Hard</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of these, with a wide range of possible use: <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> labour; a <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> assignment; a <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> struggle. As with the rest of these words, <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> does not suggest impossibility of success so much as the extremes of effort that will be required to attain it. <B><FONT color=blue>Difficult</FONT></B> is slightly more formal and somewhat more restricted in range as compared to <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I>. Where <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> might suggest that a burdensome exertion alone is required, <I><FONT color=brown>difficult</FONT></I> frequently stresses a more complex task that may demand control or skill: the <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> work of unloading the boxes and the <I><FONT color=brown>difficult</FONT></I> job of weighing and inspecting them. <I><FONT color=brown>Hard</FONT></I>, furthermore, might suggest a firm or unmerciful stand, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>difficult</FONT></I> again stresses complexity, often of a puzzling kind: a <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> master; a <I><FONT color=brown>difficult</FONT></I> employer; taking a <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> line on these <I><FONT color=brown>difficult</FONT></I> problems.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Laborious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>arduous</FONT></B> are both more formal than the preceding pair, but are otherwise more closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>hard</FONT></I> than to <I><FONT color=brown>difficult</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Laborious</FONT></I> is more restricted than hard in applying almost exclusively to the use of sheer effort or exertion in accomplishing a task, with few suggestions of the skill that might be required and no reference to the complexity of a problem: the <I><FONT color=brown>laborious</FONT></I> job of cleaning up after the flood. <I><FONT color=brown>Arduous</FONT></I> is even more formal than laborious and less restricted in suggesting burdensome effort or almost unmerciful firmness of stand: our <I><FONT color=brown>arduous</FONT></I> struggle to lay the carpet before the guests arrived; unnecessarily <I><FONT color=brown>arduous</FONT></I> regulations.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Perplexing</FONT></B> relates closely to <I><FONT color=brown>difficult</FONT></I>, but is more exclusively restricted to describing a task or requirement that is <I><FONT color=brown>difficult</FONT></I> to understand. Thus, while <I><FONT color=brown>laborious</FONT></I> stresses effort, often of a physical kind, <I><FONT color=brown>perplexing</FONT></I> most often suggests the intellectual demands made by a task; it would not be appropriate, one the other hand, to describe effort of any sort: the <I><FONT color=brown>perplexing</FONT></I> job of finding the ten-cent discrepancy in the day’s accounts.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Troublesome</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>trying</FONT></B> also pertain mostly to difficult tasks rather than to the effort required to solve them. <I><FONT color=brown>Troublesome</FONT></I> suggests confusion or disorder or even unpleasant resistance; this contrasts with the intellectual demands made by a <I><FONT color=brown>perplexing</FONT></I> task: the <I><FONT color=brown>troublesome</FONT></I> job of interviewing every one of the suspicious neighbours. <I><FONT color=brown>Trying</FONT></I>, by contrast, is much less specific concerning the kind of resistance it points to; it may suggest any kind of obstacle that taxes the worker’s patience, skill or mental equanimity: too <I><FONT color=brown>trying</FONT></I> to be a baby-sitter for such a spoilt child. The word does beyond <I><FONT color=brown>perplexing</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>troublesome</FONT></I> in being applicable to effort as well, in which case it suggests the sapping of energy or will: finding the struggle to sit up too <I><FONT color=brown>trying</FONT></I> in her weakened condition.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Labour">LABOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Obstacle">OBSTACLE</A>, <A href="entry://Puzzle">PUZZLE</A>, <A href="entry://Stress">STRESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Simple">SIMPLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all mean to affect a person or thing in such a way as to lessen health, strength, value, beauty, etc. <B><FONT color=blue>Harm</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>damage</FONT></B> are both wide in application. <I><FONT color=brown>Harm</FONT></I> refers to living things and, occasionally, to inanimate objects: afraid that in his fury he would <I><FONT color=brown>harm</FONT></I> the child; worried that her belongings might have been <I><FONT color=brown>harmed</FONT></I>. The point of the word is that it can suggest any sort of negative outcome, and thus is widely used in an abstract way, especially when an immoral or unethical impairment is at issue: those who unwittingly <I><FONT color=brown>harm</FONT></I> the cause of peace. <I><FONT color=brown>Damage</FONT></I> stresses impairment of value or function and, while it can be applied to living things, is more commonly used to refer to inanimate objects. [Her heart was slightly <I><FONT color=brown>damaged</FONT></I> as a result of her long illness; The gale <I><FONT color=brown>damaged</FONT></I> several houses; The candidate <I><FONT color=brown>damaged</FONT></I> his chances of election by a very poorly run campaign.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hurt</FONT></B>, the most informal of the group, is mainly, but not wholly, restricted to living things, and is general in applying to both a severe or minor impairment: a puppy that had been <I><FONT color=brown>hurt</FONT></I> by the tomcat; a few scratches, proving that children are bound to get <I><FONT color=brown>hurt</FONT></I> when they play; badly <I><FONT color=brown>hurt</FONT></I> in the car crash; a reputation <I><FONT color=brown>hurt</FONT></I> by an enemy’s vicious lies. <B><FONT color=blue>Injure</FONT></B> is a slightly formal substitute for hurt. But, while <I><FONT color=brown>hurt</FONT></I> concentrates more on the registering of a pain that need not override usefulness, <I><FONT color=brown>injure</FONT></I> often indicates at least a temporary loss of some function: continuing to type as fast as ever, though she had <I><FONT color=brown>hurt</FONT></I> her finger while manicuring her nails; a bird that hopped about helplessly as if one of its wings had been <I><FONT color=brown>injured</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>incapacitate</FONT></B> both intensify suggestions of injure in pointing more definitely to a temporary or permanent loss of function. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>disable</FONT></I> is more likely to suggest a partial impairment, perhaps permanent, but one that need not affect usefulness: serving as chairman of the board, though <I><FONT color=brown>disabled</FONT></I> by polio. <I><FONT color=brown>Incapacitate</FONT></I>, by contrast, is more formal and tends to suggest a total loss of function or effectiveness: the tragedy of a very active man who had been <I><FONT color=brown>incapacitated</FONT></I> by a stroke. Both words, however, go beyond the previous pair in their application to inanimate things: its retro-rockets <I><FONT color=brown>disabled</FONT></I> by a misfire during blast-off; snow-clogged roads that would <I><FONT color=brown>incapacitate</FONT></I> any car without tyre chains.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hurt">HURT</A>, <A href="entry://Weak">WEAK</A>, <A href="entry://Wound">WOUND</A>.</P><P>ANTONYMS; <A href="entry://Repair">REPAIR</A>, <A href="entry://Treat">TREAT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a member of a religion or culture outside one?s own. In the early stages of Christianity’s growth, both <B><FONT color=blue>heathen</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pagan</FONT></B> could refer indiscriminately to an adherent of a religion other than Judaism or Christianity, especially those unexposed or resistant to Christianization. Both suggested someone who belonged to a pre-existing culture that was alien and therefore inferior to that of the speaker: Chinese <I><FONT color=brown>heathens</FONT></I>; Teutonic <I><FONT color=brown>pagans</FONT></I>; Moslem <I><FONT color=brown>heathens</FONT></I>. By the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, a difference in the use of the word was clear. <I><FONT color=brown>Pagan</FONT></I> could refer, less disapprovingly, to the ancient Greek or Roman who worshipped a polytheistic pantheon of gods before the advent of Christianity. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>heathen</FONT></I> referred more specifically to an adherent of an existing religion subscribed to by a primitive culture or one remote from Christianity. In practice, those peoples were called <I><FONT color=brown>heathens</FONT></I> who were actually being proselytized by Christian missionaries in the field. Thus, adherents of Islam might no longer be so described, even though members of sophisticated cultures like the Japanese and Chinese were still thought of as <I><FONT color=brown>heathens</FONT></I>. The word often was used, in fact, as though it were synonymous with savage. African <I><FONT color=brown>heathens</FONT></I>; the cannibalistic <I><FONT color=brown>heathens</FONT></I> of New Guinea. In this century, a growing respect for the integrity of other cultures and religions has made any use of <I><FONT color=brown>heathen</FONT></I> suspect and out-of-date. Pagan, however, can be used for any individual, even within one’s own culture, who rejects metaphysical speculation and values a life of the intellect and, particularly, of the senses.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Barbarian</FONT></B> comes from a Greek root that means foreign, rude or ignorant. It was in these terms that a sophisticated Greek viewed people from cultures other than his own. Historically, the word often refers to the Germanic people who overran the Roman Empire, and later uses reflect this in carrying implications of ruthlessness, cruelty, illiteracy and lack of civilized standards. Thus the word contrasts with others of this group in registering cultural rather than religious disapproval of an alien group. Except in historical reference, the word is seldom used except as a pejorative hyperbole for a crude, vulgar or violent person: educators who see the current contempt for knowledge and scholarship as fostering a new generation of <I><FONT color=brown>barbarians</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Infidel</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>heathen</FONT></I>, once emphasized disapproval of an established non-Christian conversion or expansion: a crusade to wipe out the Saracen <I><FONT color=brown>infidel</FONT></I> in the Holy Land. The word is often used to refer to what was corresponding Islamic attitude towards Christians: sultans who contributed to the war against the invading Christian <I><FONT color=brown>infidel</FONT></I>. More recently, the word could refer to any individual unbeliever, but even this use is now dated.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gentile</FONT></B> is the one word here that can currently be used in exact and neutral classification. Its most widely understood reference is to anyone not an adherent to Judaism: European <I><FONT color=brown>gentiles</FONT></I> who assisted Jews in escaping from the Nazis; a new spirit of tolerance between Jews and <I><FONT color=brown>gentiles</FONT></I>. In New Testament usage, the word can refer to someone both non-Jewish and non-Christian: Paul’s missions to convert the <I><FONT color=brown>Gentiles</FONT></I> to Christianity.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Heretic">HERETIC</A>, <A href="entry://Renegade">RENEGADE</A>, <A href="entry://Sceptic">SCEPTIC</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to weight or pressure so severe that it is difficult to bear. <B><FONT color=blue>Heavy</FONT></B> is the most informal and the least intense of these words indicating something of relative weightiness. [He wondered if the floor could support the <I><FONT color=brown>heavy</FONT></I> piano; She insisted that the package was not very <I><FONT color=brown>heavy</FONT></I>.] Metaphorically, the word suggests something difficult or unpleasant: a <I><FONT color=brown>heavy</FONT></I> duty; He went to meet her with a <I><FONT color=brown>heavy</FONT></I> heart. The word need not, of course, suggest the idea of a carried weight at all. <B><FONT color=blue>Burdensome</FONT></B>, by contrast, specifically refers to something that is <I><FONT color=brown>heavy</FONT></I> and must be carried or supported; it is also more formal and more frequently used in an abstract way: a <I><FONT color=brown>burdensome</FONT></I> obligation; the <I><FONT color=brown>burdensome</FONT></I> post of chief administrator. The implication is that while the weight or task is difficult it can, with effort, be supported.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Onerous</FONT></B> is thus an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>burdensome</FONT></I>, being at the same time still more formal than the previous words. It is almost exclusively used abstractly for describing such things as supremely trying tasks or duties: the <I><FONT color=brown>onerous</FONT></I> job of correcting one hundred essays a week. The word gives an implication of an unfair or unjust assignment of duties: class assignments that were reasonable in one case and extremely <I><FONT color=brown>onerous</FONT></I> in another. <B><FONT color=blue>Oppressive</FONT></B> relates to this last possibility for <I><FONT color=brown>onerous</FONT></I>, suggesting harsh or cruel demands that can scarcely be borne: an <I><FONT color=brown>oppressive</FONT></I> taskmaster; <I><FONT color=brown>oppressive</FONT></I> taxation that reduced the peasants to a state of abject poverty. <B><FONT color=blue>Crushing</FONT></B> is the most intense of all these words and may suggest both literally and metaphorically, a weight or force that cannot be borne at all: the <I><FONT color=brown>crushing</FONT></I> impact of the plummeting airliner; poverty so <I><FONT color=brown>crushing</FONT></I> as to immobilize completely whole segments of society.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Massive">MASSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Size">SIZE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: easy, light, mild, <A href="entry://Trivial">TRIVIAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a lack of awareness that produces slipshod, dangerous or offensive results. <B><FONT color=blue>Heedless</FONT></B> most strongly indicates inattentiveness, with disapproving suggestions of self-preoccupation, stubbornness or indifference to the feelings or safety or others. [<I><FONT color=brown>Heedless</FONT></I> of everything but the striking impression she was making; <I><FONT color=brown>heedless</FONT></I> of his parents?sound advice; He kept make caustic remarks, <I><FONT color=brown>heedless</FONT></I> of whom he might offend; The let out sail, <I><FONT color=brown>headless</FONT></I> of the gathering storm clouds.] <B><FONT color=blue>Thoughtless</FONT></B> is less disapproving in tone, suggesting a lapse or failure, possibly unintentional, rather than the determined disregarding indicated by heedless: a <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtless</FONT></I> mistake; He apologized for having been so <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtless</FONT></I> of her feelings. Consequently, it can be used euphemistically for <I><FONT color=brown>heedless</FONT></I>, although it occasionally expresses disapproval in its own right: the typically <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtless</FONT></I> and irresponsible behaviour of teenagers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inconsiderate</FONT></B> relates most closely to <I><FONT color=brown>heedless</FONT></I>, and <B><FONT color=blue>insensitive</FONT></B> to <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtless</FONT></I>. Both words, however, concentrate more on doing injury to the feelings of others. <I><FONT color=brown>Inconsiderate</FONT></I> expresses almost as much disapproval as <I><FONT color=brown>heedless</FONT></I> in pointing to conscious, if not deliberate, discourtesy towards others: his <I><FONT color=brown>inconsiderate</FONT></I> insistence on playing the radiogram when his roommates were trying to study. <I><FONT color=brown>Insensitive</FONT></I> may suggest that the discourtesy is unintentional in that it stems from a lack of understanding of other people’s needs: <I><FONT color=brown>insensitive</FONT></I> to their strong disapproval of his dropping in on them unannounced. The word also suggests, more than any other word here, a lack of awareness of finer shadings of meanings: <I><FONT color=brown>insensitive</FONT></I> to the nuances of diplomatic protocol.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Careless</FONT></B> is the most general of these words and can substitute, with a loss of preciseness, for any of them, regardless of the area of meaning involved. Most commonly, however, it is closest to <B><FONT color=blue>incautious</FONT></B> in indicating a <I><FONT color=brown>heedless</FONT></I> attitude to standards of accuracy or safety; laziness, indifference or preoccupation may be suggested as possible reasons for the housekeeping; a sense of false safety that made them careless about locking their door at night; so rushed that he grew <I><FONT color=brown>careless</FONT></I> in adding up the last attitude towards safety, with the suggestion that this results from a <I><FONT color=brown>thoughtless</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>insensitive</FONT></I> recklessness: <I><FONT color=brown>incautious</FONT></I> about letting the children play out in the street.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impetuous">IMPETUOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Oblivious">OBLIVIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Reckless">RECKLESS</A>, <A href="entry://None">RUDE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: careful, <A href="entry://Considerate">CONSIDERATE</A>, <A href="entry://Observant">OBSERVANT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to an act that one person performs for another. Of these, <B><FONT color=blue>help</FONT></B> is the most informal; it is also sharply separated from most of the others in implying a more desperately needed item than they suggest. <B><FONT color=blue>Succour</FONT></B> is similar in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I> but is more formal and restricted in its use. It can denote military reinforcement or <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I> but has always had special connotations of that <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I> or refuge given to someone incapacitated, ill or in need of spiritual uplift: <I><FONT color=brown>succour</FONT></I> for the besieged garrison; those wonderful workers who offer <I><FONT color=brown>succour</FONT></I> for the infirm and aged in our community. <B><FONT color=blue>Assistance</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>aid</FONT></B> only contribute to what one can do for himself, but a person in need of <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I> may be literally helpless, that is, in danger or trouble. <I><FONT color=brown>Help</FONT></I> also necessarily connotes generosity or charity, something given out of kindness or pity, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>assistance</FONT></I> can be something purchased. [I was flat broke in a strange town with nowhere to turn for <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I>; To the very last days of the siege, they never gave up hope that <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I> would soon arrive.] The element of urgency in this use is not, however, invariably present in other uses. <I><FONT color=brown>Help</FONT></I> may, for example, merely refer to the lesser part of a shared task: While she did most of the cooking, her daughters were of some <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I>, however small. In this use, it approaches the meanings most commonly implied in <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>assistance</FONT></I>.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Aid</FONT></I> is slightly more formal than help, assistance more formal still. <I><FONT color=brown>Aid</FONT></I> is particularly used in combination: state <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I> to church schools; foreign <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I>; first <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I>; visual <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I>. It can also be used for situations of emergency or danger: The stricken ship sent an SOS for immediate <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I>. In some cases where the use of help suggests itself, aid might sound unnecessarily stiff: Thank you for your <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Assistance</FONT></B>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I>, would more rarely be used for urgently needed <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I>, but it is an acceptable and more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I> when referring to the subordinate part of a shared task: A surgeon’s success depends on the expert <I><FONT color=brown>assistance</FONT></I> of very nurse and orderly who attends him.</P><P>The relationship between <B><FONT color=blue>support</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>service</FONT></B> is somewhat like that between <I><FONT color=brown>help</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>aid</FONT></I>. Both may imply a subordinate task, but <I><FONT color=brown>support</FONT></I> suggests one more vitally needed, <I><FONT color=brown>service</FONT></I> one that may give added comfort but remains optional in nature. <I><FONT color=brown>Support</FONT></I> may suggest an advisory role, one primarily of giving encouragement, or one that consists of standing behind and defending someone in danger. [I don’t know how to change a flat tyre, but I can give you moral <I><FONT color=brown>support</FONT></I>; The Ordnance Corps gives front-line <I><FONT color=brown>support</FONT></I> to the infantry; Though a husband and wife have separated, he is still legally responsible for her <I><FONT color=brown>support</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Service</FONT></I> often implies a convenience that may be purchased: domestic <I><FONT color=brown>service</FONT></I>; telephone-answering <I><FONT color=brown>service</FONT></I>; laundry <I><FONT color=brown>service</FONT></I>. On the other hand, it may suggest a gratuitous benefit gained with the purchase of something else: We offer free parking as still another <I><FONT color=brown>service</FONT></I> to our patrons.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Relief</FONT></B> has more in common with <I><FONT color=brown>support</FONT></I> than with <I><FONT color=brown>service</FONT></I>, but it perhaps connotes more urgency than any of these words: if he could only stay afloat another day, he was certain that <I><FONT color=brown>relief</FONT></I> would be in sight. It is used also to refer to government aid for the indigent: If you can’t <I><FONT color=brown>support</FONT></I> your family, you can at least apply or <I><FONT color=brown>relief</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Benevolence">BENEVOLENCE</A>, <A href="entry://Comfort">COMFORT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: harm, hindrance.</P>

<P>These words pertain to people who espouse independent or anti-authoritarian views in opposition to the doctrines of a religion or ideology. <B><FONT color=blue>Heretic</FONT></B> refers to a believer who wilfully espouses a tenet that his church has officially declared to be anathema. Taking a stand on an issue the church has not ruled on would not make a person a <I><FONT color=brown>heretic</FONT></I>. And while the church may punish a <I><FONT color=brown>heretic</FONT></I> by ejecting him or, at one time, putting him to death, a <I><FONT color=brown>heretic’s</FONT></I> aim need not be to separate from the church but possibly to stay within and reform it. A <B><FONT color=blue>schismatic</FONT></B>, by contrast, may or may not have serious doctrinal objections to church teachings, but his avowed aim is to establish a separatist faction or competing religious body. A <I><FONT color=brown>schismatic</FONT></I>, furthermore, would most likely be one of a group or its leader, whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>heretic</FONT></I> an be a single individual with or without followers: The early Protestants expected to be condemned as <I><FONT color=brown>heretics</FONT></I>, but didn’t foresee that this would inevitably result in their becoming <I><FONT color=brown>schismatic</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dissenter</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>nonconformist</FONT></B> both originally pertained to people who in some way opposed the established Church of England. A <I><FONT color=brown>dissenter</FONT></I> was someone who rejected a particular doctrine without leaving the church, while a <I><FONT color=brown>nonconformist</FONT></I> was anyone who would not give to the established church the loyalty required by law. Roughly speaking, a dissenter criticized from within the Church of England, the <I><FONT color=brown>nonconformist</FONT></I> resisted from without. <B><FONT color=blue>Sectarian</FONT></B> once referred to a <I><FONT color=brown>schismatic</FONT></I> who founded or advocated the founding of a denomination independent of the original church. Later, it could simply indicate a member of any denomination or sect. More recently, the word is avoided altogether because it can imply a superior-inferior relationship between the original church and the later formation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dissenter</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>nonconformist</FONT></B> are widely used outside the context of religion. In this case, <I><FONT color=brown>dissent</FONT></I> usually implies someone who is extremely critical of some established order and wishes to reform it: youthful <I><FONT color=brown>dissenters</FONT></I> who were organizing a protest march. <I><FONT color=brown>Nonconformist</FONT></I>, by contrast, more often refers to someone who is idiosyncratic in his personal behaviour and appearance in such a way as to exhibit a sharp departure from custom; the word, thus, need not suggest the advocacy of any formulated ideological stand whatsoever; long-haired <I><FONT color=brown>nonconformists</FONT></I> who were little more than pleasure-seeking exhibitionists and who had no political commitment of any kind. <I><FONT color=brown>Heretic</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>schismatic</FONT></I> can occasionally be used of people carrying on doctrinal disputes about an authoritarian ideology; in this case, the words often have a humorous or ironic note: those Communists that Stalin decided to condemn as <I><FONT color=brown>heretics</FONT></I>; the infighting common among Trotskyite <I><FONT color=brown>schismatics</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Denomination">DENOMINATION</A>, <A href="entry://Faction">FACTION</A>, HEATHEN <A href="entry://Renegade">RENEGADE</A>, <A href="entry://Sceptic">SCEPTIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: adherent, compatriot, conformist, follower, <A href="entry://Supporter">SUPPORTER</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to indecisive actions. <B><FONT color=blue>Hesitate</FONT></B> suggests a momentary stopping of activity because of uncertainty, reluctance or a conflict of emotions: She <I><FONT color=brown>hesitated</FONT></I> fearfully between accepting him and denying him; the secretary who <I><FONT color=brown>hesitates</FONT></I> to interrupt her boss when he is in conference. The act of <I><FONT color=brown>hesitating</FONT></I>, of course, may imply a completely mental weighing of alternatives, or an initial immobility before a decision has been made. This contrasts strongly with <B><FONT color=blue>pause</FONT></B> is also the most neutral of all these words in referring to a temporary halt; while all the other words suggest uneasiness, however faintly, <I><FONT color=brown>pause</FONT></I> may suggest a preconceived plan and indicate no irresoluteness whatsoever: They <I><FONT color=brown>paused</FONT></I> for six counts between each pirouette. The point of the word may be brevity: He <I><FONT color=brown>paused</FONT></I> before each painting only long enough to note the painter’s name. Or its point may be to stress the mere fact of the halt, without ascribing motive: uncertain whether she <I><FONT color=brown>paused</FONT></I> at the door out of fear or fascination.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Falter</FONT></B> has a much clearer emotional overtone than <I><FONT color=brown>hesitate</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>pause</FONT></I>. It suggests either intense doubt, helplessness, awkwardness or incompetence: She <I><FONT color=brown>faltered</FONT></I> midway in her denunciation as she saw new reasons to detest him; bushwalkers <I><FONT color=brown>faltering</FONT></I> across the slippery stepping stones; an actor so drunk that he <I><FONT color=brown>faltered</FONT></I> through most of his lines. <I><FONT color=brown>Falter</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>pause</FONT></I>, may suggest an interruption, but it can also suggest an extremely slow or faulty performance, as in the last example above. In this sense, <B><FONT color=blue>flounder</FONT></B> is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>falter</FONT></I>, referring to a bungled motion that continues erratically because of panic or disablement: obviously unprepared from the way he <I><FONT color=brown>floundered</FONT></I> through the recitation; the sudden cramp that caused him to <I><FONT color=brown>flounder</FONT></I> desperately in the deep water.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Waver</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vacillate</FONT></B>, by contrast, return to the milder uneasiness of <I><FONT color=brown>hesitate</FONT></I>, although both may suggest a poorly continued motion rather than a temporary halt or initial moment of indecision. Both, in fact, suggest a motion that goes back and forth between two alternatives. <I><FONT color=brown>Vacillate</FONT></I> would be more appropriate to describe mental activity that veers between extremes. Where <I><FONT color=brown>hesitate</FONT></I> in such a context might suggest a suspension of will, <I><FONT color=brown>vacillate</FONT></I> suggests wild swings of choice. [While she <I><FONT color=brown>hesitated</FONT></I>, he <I><FONT color=brown>vacillated</FONT></I> between taking back his offer and urging her to accept.] <I><FONT color=brown>Waver</FONT></I> would be more appropriate to describe a physical act that reveals uncertainty. In this context, it is close to <I><FONT color=brown>hesitate</FONT></I>; one who <I><FONT color=brown>hesitate</FONT></I> may not move at all, however, whereas waver suggests slight, indecisive gestures and uneasy movement. [She <I><FONT color=brown>hesitated</FONT></I> so long that he <I><FONT color=brown>wavered</FONT></I> on his way to join her.] <I><FONT color=brown>Waver</FONT></I>, when it refers to mental activity, suggests less violent swings than <I><FONT color=brown>vacillate</FONT></I>, and between less clearly defined positions: He stood <I><FONT color=brown>wavering</FONT></I> among a thousand dimly imagined possibilities.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Demur">DEMUR</A>, <A href="entry://Inconstant">INCONSTANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: ascertain, <A href="entry://Choose">CHOOSE</A>, continue, <A href="entry://Decide">DECIDE</A>.</P>

<P>These words are used to characterize a collection or group of things or people that are not all alike, or are used to describe a mass made up of different elements. <B><FONT color=blue>Heterogeneous</FONT></B> emphasizes most strongly the differences among individuals or elements closely connected but not necessarily unified. [New York City has a <I><FONT color=brown>heterogeneous</FONT></I> population; The former tenants had left behind a <I><FONT color=brown>heterogeneous</FONT></I> pile of rubbish; Porphyry is a <I><FONT color=brown>heterogeneous</FONT></I> rock.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Miscellaneous</FONT></B> emphasizes diversity arising from lack of any unifying principle in selections and suggests things that have been brought together casually or by chance. [A small boy’s pockets are likely to contain a <I><FONT color=brown>miscellaneous</FONT></I> collection of objects; a politician who was on a first-name basis with hundreds of <I><FONT color=brown>miscellaneous</FONT></I> people.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mixed</FONT></B>, as considered here, is often used interchangeably with the other words discussed. Specifically it suggests dissimilarity among elements or individuals in a group or mass, but seldom a diversity as extreme or fortuitous as that suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>miscellaneous</FONT></I>. [When you buy a tin of <I><FONT color=brown>mixed</FONT></I> nuts, you get walnuts, cashews, Brazil nuts, almonds and Barcelona nuts; A <I><FONT color=brown>mixed</FONT></I> social gathering is made up of people of both sexes.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Motley</FONT></B> means literally having a variety of colours, but in this context, it describes persons or things that are strongly contrasted or even discordant. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>heterogeneous</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>miscellaneous</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>mixed</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>motley</FONT></I> has a derogatory connotation.

<B><FONT color=blue>hew</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>chop</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cut</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hack</FONT></B>:

<P>These words mean to penetrate and divide something by means of an instrument with a sharp edge. <B><FONT color=blue>Hew</FONT></B> usually means to make or shape by means of heavy blows of a tool such as an axe or by wielding a chisel or adze: the <I><FONT color=brown>hew</FONT></I> logs into short lengths; to <I><FONT color=brown>hew</FONT></I> stones into proper shapes for building a wall. <I><FONT color=brown>Hew</FONT></I> may also indicate a destructive act, although in this sense it tends to sound high-flown and literary: to <I><FONT color=brown>hew</FONT></I> down a mighty oak; to <I><FONT color=brown>hew</FONT></I> one’s adversary to pieces.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chop</FONT></B> means to divide into two or many pieces or to make a blow, or a series of blows, with a hatchet, cleaver, knife, etc.: to <I><FONT color=brown>chop</FONT></I> onions into small pieces; to <I><FONT color=brown>chop</FONT></I> open a coconut husk; to <I><FONT color=brown>chop</FONT></I> a hole in the ice.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hack</FONT></B> means to <I><FONT color=brown>chop</FONT></I> at something or to mangle or slash it away entirely by irregular and clumsy blows of a tool. [The firemen were forced to <I><FONT color=brown>hack</FONT></I> down the door to rescue the children; The vandals had <I><FONT color=brown>hacked</FONT></I> furniture with knives; The little girl <I><FONT color=brown>hacked</FONT></I> off her long hair.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cut</FONT></B> has a much wider application than the other words and may be a loose synonym for any of them.

In many instances <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> suggests care and forethought in what one is doing.

<P>These words refer to things that in some way stand over or above their surroundings or above similar things, either in a literal or a figurative sense. <B><FONT color=blue>Highest</FONT></B> is the most general word. It may mean located at the greatest elevation: the <I><FONT color=brown>highest</FONT></I> story of a building; the <I><FONT color=brown>highest</FONT></I> peak in the mountain range. <I><FONT color=brown>Highest</FONT></I> also refers to something of the greatest importance: the <I><FONT color=brown>highest</FONT></I> law of the land; the <I><FONT color=brown>highest</FONT></I> good. In reference to degree, amount or size, <I><FONT color=brown>highest</FONT></I> is frequently used. [We pay the <I><FONT color=brown>highest</FONT></I> prices for old gold; The tide is highest at eleven o’clock.

[The <I><FONT color=brown>supreme</FONT></I> moment of a gambler’s life is when he breaks the bank at Monte Carlo.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Topmost</FONT></B> may refer to a person who has the highest position in a specific situation: the <I><FONT color=brown>topmost</FONT></I> executive of the company.

<P>These words mean to put difficulties or obstacles in the way or progress of. <B><FONT color=blue>Hinder</FONT></B> is the most general term and the least strong in meaning. Specifically, to <I><FONT color=brown>hinder</FONT></I> is to delay or slow down a person or thing, and it may imply either active interference or an accidental action or condition. [The child’s hysterical crying <I><FONT color=brown>hindered</FONT></I> the doctor from completing his examination; Bad weather <I><FONT color=brown>hindered</FONT></I> the military operation; Overcrowded schoolrooms <I><FONT color=brown>hinder</FONT></I> the education of our children.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Impede</FONT></B> is to delay by a deliberate act, and it retains much of its original meaning of fettering the feet. <I><FONT color=brown>Impede</FONT></I> suggests stronger obstacles than does hinder and implies a forcible slowing down that is frustrating and even painful. [The crowds at the scene of the accident <I><FONT color=brown>impeded</FONT></I> the arrival of the ambulance; Many a man is <I><FONT color=brown>impeded</FONT></I> in his career by a lack of belief in himself.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hamper</FONT></B> means to impede by placing restraints of any sort which make action burdensome and difficult. [<I><FONT color=brown>Hampered</FONT></I> by four small whining children, the young mother had difficulty in getting on the bus; Too strong a sense of duty <I><FONT color=brown>hampered</FONT></I> him from enjoying life.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Encumber</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>hamper</FONT></I>, suggests a <I><FONT color=brown>hindering</FONT></I> of action or motion by outside forces. However, in the case of <I><FONT color=brown>encumber</FONT></I>, the <I><FONT color=brown>hindering</FONT></I> comes about by the placing of a burden rather than by that of a restraint. [The little donkey was so <I><FONT color=brown>encumbered</FONT></I> with produce for market that he could scarcely walk; Debts <I><FONT color=brown>encumbered</FONT></I> the young family while the children were small.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Obstruct</FONT></B> is the strongest term in this group. It implies not only a delay in action or movement, but often a complete halt by the placing of large, immovable objects in one’s path.

<P>These words refer to signs or evidence, indirectly given or covertly present, from which certain meanings may be inferred. <B><FONT color=blue>Hint</FONT></B> is the most informal of these words and most often refers to a sign intentionally given to alert someone else to something that might otherwise be overlooked: giving him a <I><FONT color=brown>hint</FONT></I> that she wouldn’t mind being asked for a date. The word may also refer to clues unintentionally given: inadvertent behaviour that was a hint of some deeper emotional disturbance. At an even further remove, the word may suggest a sign inherent in any set of data: a campsite that gave <I><FONT color=brown>hints</FONT></I> of recent use; a <I><FONT color=brown>hint</FONT></I> of autumn in the air.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Suggestion</FONT></B> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>hint</FONT></I> in that it may refer to more directly presented statements; even here, however, the emphasis is on a tactful presentation that stops short of insistence or flat recommendation: her <I><FONT color=brown>suggestion</FONT></I> that he try thinning the paint with turpentine. Less commonly than with <I><FONT color=brown>hint</FONT></I>, the word may refer to inadvertent clues or to signs inherent in data: a <I><FONT color=brown>suggestion</FONT></I> of nervousness in the way he kept running his hand through his hair; a city that teemed with <I><FONT color=brown>suggestions</FONT></I> concerning the fast-paced life of its inhabitants.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Implication</FONT></B> may, like <I><FONT color=brown>hint</FONT></I>, refer to an intentionally given sign, although greater indirection is stressed: He backed up her suggestion that the child get ready for bed, with a broad <I><FONT color=brown>hint</FONT></I> about a bedtime snack and an unspoken <I><FONT color=brown>implication</FONT></I> that the child might be punished for not obeying. More often the word is restricted to indicate indirect evidence of any sort from which meaning can be inferred: arguing that the development of an inconsiderate selfishness was one <I><FONT color=brown>implication</FONT></I> of the permissive rearing of children; an <I><FONT color=brown>implication</FONT></I> of disapproval that underlay the author’s seemingly objective treatment of his major character.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intimation</FONT></B> is alone among these words in stressing the gaining of an insight into the future: an <I><FONT color=brown>intimation</FONT></I> from the outset that he would not find his new job a pleasant one. Sometimes the word may suggest a vague feeling or suspicion arrived at without evidence of any kind, either by intuitive or supernatural processes: an <I><FONT color=brown>intimation</FONT></I> that he would one day ask her to marry him; an <I><FONT color=brown>intimation</FONT></I> that the world would come to an end on Friday. The word may also refer to intuitions or suspicion that do not pertain to futurity: getting any number of <I><FONT color=brown>intimations</FONT></I> that his friend’s childhood had been unusually bleak and forbidding.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Innuendo</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>insinuation</FONT></B> are closely related; both are set apart from these other words by concentrating mainly on intentionally given signs that bristle with unpleasant or hostile meanings. <I><FONT color=brown>Innuendo</FONT></I> can be seen as a negative implication; <I><FONT color=brown>insinuation</FONT></I> as a negative suggestion: making a thinly veiled <I><FONT color=brown>innuendo</FONT></I> that reflected on the morality of his opponent; a barrage of slight but mounting <I><FONT color=brown>insinuations</FONT></I> that he should perhaps give up trying to be a playwright. <I><FONT color=brown>Innuendo</FONT></I>, in addition, implies an unsupported or unsupportable personal attack that is never spelt out; <I><FONT color=brown>insinuation</FONT></I> may imply a process of worming one’s way into someone’s favour by obsequious methods in order to harm that person or someone else: Cassiu’s <I><FONT color=brown>innuendoes</FONT></I> to Brutus about Caesar’s untrustworthiness; Iago’s <I><FONT color=brown>insinuations</FONT></I> concerning Desdemona’s virtue.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Premonition">PREMONITION</A>, <A href="entry://Symptom">SYMPTOM</A>.</P><P>ANTONYMS; affirmation, assertion, declaration.</P>

<P>These words refer to people, usually young and sometimes artistic or quasi-artistic in bent, who as a group rebel against middle-class standards and choose to live a spontaneous, impoverished life characterized by eccentric dress, amoral behaviour, and an anarchic, solipsistic, or leftist philosophy. <B><FONT color=blue>Hippie</FONT></B> refer to a member of the most clearly defined such group to emerge in the late 1960s. <I><FONT color=brown>Hippies</FONT></I>, most typically, were under thirty, were interested in psychedelic drugs, rock music, communal living and an apolitical oriental philosophy based universal love. Historically, <B><FONT color=blue>bohemian</FONT></B> can refer to a member of the earliest such group to gain notice, emerging in Paris around the turn of the century; a romanticized version of their life was the subject of Puccini’s opera La Bohème. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>hippies</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>bohemians</FONT></I> were more often struggling young artists whose poverty was involuntary stemming from the neglect of their work by the public. The word was taken up and extended to any group of artists who congregated in certain sections of big cities: the <I><FONT color=brown>bohemians</FONT></I> who gathered in Greenwich Village during the Great Depression. While the word is thus more general, it can now sound dated except in historical usage.</P><P>In the 1950s, the American word <B><FONT color=blue>hipster</FONT></B> (earlier, hepster) referred to a member of a coterie that doted on avant-garde jazz and adopted a "cool" or uninvolved life-style as a protest against what they saw as a dehumanizing society. At first, a <I><FONT color=brown>hipster</FONT></I> might have been most typically a Negro musician, but the word widened out to include anyone who modelled his life on such jazz heroes as Charlie Parker. Inspired in part by the <I><FONT color=brown>hipster</FONT></I>, a literary movement arose in this period whose practitioners were called <B><FONT color=blue>beatniks</FONT></B>. Forerunner of the 1960s <I><FONT color=brown>hippie</FONT></I>, the <I><FONT color=brown>beatnik</FONT></I> dressed in jeans and T-shirt, wore his hair long, advocated unconventional or undisciplined literary forms, and valued jazz, motor-cycles, aimless travelling from city to city, and the drug experience. In their extreme alienation from society, <I><FONT color=brown>beatniks</FONT></I> were often pessimistic in outlook whereas the later <I><FONT color=brown>hippie</FONT></I> was often optimistic in that he saw himself as the opening wedge of a generational upsurge towards a more open and positive way of life. Also, the <I><FONT color=brown>hippie</FONT></I> was less often an artist, real or imagined.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Teenybopper</FONT></B> was developed in the late 1960s to refer to young teenagers or eve 11- 12-year-olds who fanatically modelled themselves on their older <I><FONT color=brown>hippie</FONT></I> sisters in dress and devotion to pop music. Unlike their American counterparts, who are prepared to try out drugs or other experimentation, they are more often children whose main passion is to grow up before their time and break away from the real or imagined restrictions of home life.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Head</FONT></B> can refer to any <I><FONT color=brown>beatnik</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>hippie</FONT></I> or other person who is addicted to some psychedelic drug as his main pleasure and interest: a close-knit group of <I><FONT color=brown>heads</FONT></I> who turned on together at least once a week. The word is sometimes a combining form used in connection with a specific psychedelic: <I><FONT color=brown>pothead</FONT></I> (marijuana), <I><FONT color=brown>acidhead</FONT></I> (LSD), <I><FONT color=brown>A-head</FONT></I> (amphetamines). <B><FONT color=blue>Drop-out</FONT></B> refers to a <I><FONT color=brown>hippie</FONT></I> or a <I><FONT color=brown>head</FONT></I> who has completely withdrawn from society into a world of personal consciousness defined for him and heightened by the use of psychedelics. When used by members of the in-group, <I><FONT color=brown>drop-out</FONT></I> is not pejorative since the act of withdrawing is considered necessary to full personal realization. A conflicting use confuses this sense, however, since the word can also refer to young people who do not continue in high school and thus are in danger of becoming unemployables living on the edge of society in the dehumanizing culture of poverty: a government programme to train <I><FONT color=brown>drop-out</FONT></I> and, if possible return them to school.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artist">ARTIST</A>, <A href="entry://Wanderer">WANDERER</A>.</P>

The word’s brevity allows its use, as well, to refer to the general practice of filling vacancies: a department set up to take care of <I><FONT color=brown>hiring</FONT></I> and firing. <B><FONT color=blue>Employ</FONT></B> is a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>hire</FONT></I> and is sometimes used for positions of greater prestige: <I><FONT color=brown>employing</FONT></I> him as guidance counsellor. In governmental and official terminology, the word universally replaces hire: urging businesses to <I><FONT color=brown>employ</FONT></I> the handicapped. The word goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>hire</FONT></I> in referring not just to the initial taking on of someone but to his continued used. Thus, <I><FONT color=brown>employ</FONT></I>, which euphemistic for other sense of hire and often for the simple act of <I><FONT color=brown>hiring</FONT></I>, is free of such a tone in this case: a firm that <I><FONT color=brown>employed</FONT></I> a staff of two hundred people; asking when he was last <I><FONT color=brown>employed</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Engage</FONT></B> seems unnecessarily indirect when used as a substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>hire</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>employ</FONT></I> in their most common senses. The word has pertinence, however, in referring to a specific or one-time contracting for someone’s services, especially when these are of a professional nature: <I><FONT color=brown>engaging</FONT></I> a gardener to mow her lawn once a week; <I><FONT color=brown>engaging</FONT></I> a lawyer to argue his case in court. The word, like <I><FONT color=brown>employ</FONT></I>, may also refer to someone actually at work, especially in fields where work comes in spurts: <I><FONT color=brown>engaging</FONT></I> extra summer help.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Call up</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>conscript</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>enlist</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>recruit</FONT></B> have special relevance to serving in the armed forces. <I><FONT color=brown>Call up</FONT></I> and conscript are used exclusively in this sense, and always carry the implication of service that is compulsory or involuntary: <I><FONT color=brown>calling up</FONT></I> national-service trainees; protesting against being conscripted. The other two words are widely used outside a military context. <I><FONT color=brown>Recruit</FONT></I> contrasts sharply with <I><FONT color=brown>call up</FONT></I> and conscript in indicating an appeal for volunteers to undertake a task or position, not necessarily for pay: special training programmes that made it easy to <I><FONT color=brown>recruit</FONT></I> young men into the air force; <I><FONT color=brown>recruiting</FONT></I> neighbours to help put out the fire. Used transitively, <I><FONT color=brown>enlist</FONT></I> is a more general substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>recruit</FONT></I>; it may suggest seeking monetary or moral support as well as the actual acquiring of someone’s services: <I><FONT color=brown>enlisting</FONT></I> university graduates in the long-term government project; enlist<I><FONT color=brown>i</FONT></I>ng your help in the coming election. Used intransitively, the word indicates volunteering for an assignment: <I><FONT color=brown>enlisting</FONT></I> in the army rather than waiting to be <I><FONT color=brown>called up</FONT></I>. A confusion sometimes results because new arrivals or trainees in the armed forces, whether <I><FONT color=brown>recruited</FONT></I> or conscripted, are known as <I><FONT color=brown>recruits</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Draft</FONT></B> is the American equivalent of our <I><FONT color=brown>call up</FONT></I>, but is universally used in another military context ?that of allocating a force to a theatre of war or to a likely trouble-spot: an infantry battalion <I><FONT color=brown>drafted</FONT></I> to Malaysia. The word is used also in a general sense, in which the connotation of compulsory assignment is carried over: <I><FONT color=brown>drafting</FONT></I> several club members to clear away the chairs after the meeting. As in the last example, this word need not suggest working for pay, unlike the usual implications of <I><FONT color=brown>hire</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>employ</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>engage</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Labour">LABOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Lease">LEASE</A>, <A href="entry://Profession">PROFESSION</A>, <A href="entry://Use">USE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: buy, discharge, fire, purchase, retire.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>history</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>annals</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>chronicle</FONT></B>:

<P>These words denote a systematic record of past events. A <B><FONT color=blue>history</FONT></B> is a narrative that recounts events with attention to their importance, their mutual relations, causes and consequences; it is therefore highly selective: Herodotus’s famous <I><FONT color=brown>history</FONT></I> of the Persian wars; to commission an author to write a <I><FONT color=brown>history</FONT></I> of a company. A <B><FONT color=blue>chronicle</FONT></B> is a record of events in order of time; <B><FONT color=blue>annals</FONT></B> are similar but are divided year by year.

<P>These words refer to play, leisure-time activities, or side interests purused for amusement or pleasure. <B><FONT color=blue>Hobby</FONT></B> indicates an activity that may involve the development of intricate knowledge of or capability in a limited field. It particularly implies collecting or tinkering activities, often done by oneself at home and seldom involving physical exercise for its own sake: a lifelong <I><FONT color=brown>hobby</FONT></I> of stamp collecting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Avocation</FONT></B> is more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>hobby</FONT></I> and may suggest a more dedicated pursuit of something with cultural or social value: a doctor whose <I><FONT color=brown>avocation</FONT></I> was playing cello in an amateur string quartet. But, more generally, the word can group together the whole range of activities considered here, since its only restriction is its emphasis on something that is secondary to a person’s livelihood, career or central concern. <B><FONT color=blue>Recreation</FONT></B> is comparable in its generality to <I><FONT color=brown>avocation</FONT></I>. While it doesn’t emphasize the distinction between main and secondary interests, it does suggest pleasure-giving relaxation and low-key activity that would not be found in most <I><FONT color=brown>vocations</FONT></I>. The word’s stress is on play or games. Thus, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>hobby</FONT></I>, it can more often suggest activity that is done in groups and includes folk dancing, handicrafts, swimming and boating.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pastime</FONT></B> is closer to hobby than the previous pair, indicating anything done to occupy one’s leisure; by implication, the word suggests activity of little intrinsic worth: insisting that his painting was merely a <I><FONT color=brown>pastime</FONT></I> that kept him from being bored. This deprecatory note can be even more pronounced: few <I><FONT color=brown>pastimes</FONT></I> more foolish than autograph collecting. <B><FONT color=blue>Sport</FONT></B> is the one word here that points to a <I><FONT color=brown>recreation</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>pastime</FONT></I> that is primarily a matter of physical exercise, and suggests especially competitive group or individual activity: We enjoyed playing cricket, football and other sports. Unlike all the other words here, <I><FONT color=brown>sport</FONT></I> can indicate an activity purused as a money-making <I><FONT color=brown>vocation</FONT></I>: He had performed so brilliantly in amateur tennis that he took up the <I><FONT color=brown>sport</FONT></I> as a full-time professional player.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Pleasure">PLEASURE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: business, calling, <A href="entry://Labour">LABOUR</A>, livelihood, <A href="entry://Profession">PROFESSION</A>.</P>

<P>These words are compared as they denote an unfilled space within a solid body. <B><FONT color=blue>Hole</FONT></B> is the most general word, and also the most ambiguous; a <I><FONT color=brown>hole</FONT></I> in a stocking goes through it, a hole in a piece of timber may or may not go through, a <I><FONT color=brown>hole</FONT></I> in the ground does not go through the earth, but may be narrow or wide, shallow or very deep. <B><FONT color=blue>Hollow</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cavity</FONT></B> refer to an empty space within something otherwise solid or filled; of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>cavity</FONT></I> is somewhat more learned or formal except for its popular use to describe a <I><FONT color=brown>hole</FONT></I> in a tooth: the pleural <I><FONT color=brown>cavity</FONT></I> in which the lungs are situated; the abdominal <I><FONT color=brown>cavity</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Hollow</FONT></I> is frequently used of any depression or concavity in a surface: the <I><FONT color=brown>hollows</FONT></I> of the sea. <B><FONT color=blue>Pit</FONT></B> denotes primarily certain large natural <I><FONT color=brown>cavities</FONT></I>, especially in the ground; it is also used figuratively to suggest an abysmal depth, and is sometimes used to mean hell. <B><FONT color=blue>Excavation</FONT></B> is a man-made <I><FONT color=brown>cavity</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>pit</FONT></I>, as for the foundations of a buildings.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Pierce">PIERCE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bump, projection, protrusion.</P>

<P>These words refer to places or buildings in which people live, or to the people themselves. <B><FONT color=blue>Home</FONT></B> is the most general term, but it often means more than simply an occupied house or other dwelling. Specifically <I><FONT color=brown>home</FONT></I> refers to a place where one lives on a more or less permanent basis and with which one has strong personal ties of affection and loyalty. [In our <I><FONT color=brown>home</FONT></I>, Sunday dinner in the middle of the day has always been the custom; Loving parents tend to provide secure <I><FONT color=brown>homes</FONT></I> for children; The young soldier kept dreaming of <I><FONT color=brown>home</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Home</FONT></I> may also refer to a region or country in which one was born, brought up or now resides. [Latvia is the <I><FONT color=brown>home</FONT></I> of the Letts; Although I have lived in England for five years, my <I><FONT color=brown>home</FONT></I> is Christchurch, New Zealand.] By extension, the natural habitats of animals or the places in which they seek shelter for the raising of their young are often spoken of as <I><FONT color=brown>homes</FONT></I>: the wolf’s <I><FONT color=brown>home</FONT></I> in the rocky cave; the whale’s <I><FONT color=brown>home</FONT></I> in the depths of the sea.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Residence</FONT></B> is a more formal word for home and has the suggestion of an imposing or pretentious dwelling: the mayor’s <I><FONT color=brown>residence</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>residence</FONT></I> of the bank manager. <I><FONT color=brown>Residence</FONT></I> may be used to distinguish a person’s place of business or professional activity from his home: The doctor has his rooms in the city, but his <I><FONT color=brown>residence</FONT></I> is in the suburbs. A residential neighbourhood is one made up largely of <I><FONT color=brown>homes</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>residences</FONT></I> rather than of commercial establishments. Residence is sometimes applied to housing provided by an educational or other institution for its students or staff members: a nurse’s <I><FONT color=brown>residence</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>residence</FONT></I> of the school principal. In a legal sense, a person may be said to have <I><FONT color=brown>residence</FONT></I> in the state of South Australia (that is, he is enrolled there, owns property there, lodges his taxation return there etc.) although he temporarily lives and works in another region or country.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abode</FONT></B> is a somewhat high-flown, literary term for home and has a wide application, for it does not in any way connote the actual character of a home. <I><FONT color=brown>Abode</FONT></I> can also refer to a place, such as a hotel, camp, cottage by the sea, etc., in which one stays only temporarily.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>hovel</FONT></B> is a small, wretched home and suggests squalor and poverty. [Medieval serfs lived in <I><FONT color=brown>hovels</FONT></I> on their lord’s estate; Over the years, the neglected little Tudor cottage became a <I><FONT color=brown>hovel</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Habitation</FONT></B> is a generic term and is chiefly applied to the dwellings of people who have settled <I><FONT color=brown>homes</FONT></I>, in contradistinction to nomads or gypsies, who change their <I><FONT color=brown>abodes</FONT></I> to find food, pasturage or work.</P><P>Except in a legal sense, <B><FONT color=blue>domicile</FONT></B> is rarely used. <I><FONT color=brown>Domicile</FONT></I> denotes a place of <I><FONT color=brown>residence</FONT></I> where one may or may not own property but where one is permanently established or intends to reside indefinitely.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Household</FONT></B> refers to a domestic establishment ?that is, to the persons dwelling together under one roof as a social unit, and not to any actual structure. It may include not only the members of a family or other organized group, but servants and retainers as well. A <I><FONT color=brown>household</FONT></I> may also consist of a single person living alone. When the census official speaks of a "head of <I><FONT color=brown>household</FONT></I>," he is referring to the person in a family who pays the bills of maintaining the home, such as rent, mortgage payments, rates, etc.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://House">HOUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Lodgings">LODGINGS</A>.</P>

<P>These words denote types, ages and sexes of animals of the equine group, but especially of domestic <B><FONT color=blue>horses</FONT></B> of all sizes and breeds. <I><FONT color=brown>Horse</FONT></I> is the generic term. In its specific sense it refers to the full-grown, uncastrated male, or <B><FONT color=blue>stallion</FONT></B>, as contrasted with the full-grown female, or <B><FONT color=blue>mare</FONT></B>. <B><FONT color=blue>Gelding</FONT></B> refers to an adult male <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I> that has been castrated. When kept for breeding purposes, a <I><FONT color=brown>stallion</FONT></I> is often referred to as a <B><FONT color=blue>stud horse</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Mare</FONT></I> refer to any female <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I>, but correctly to one at least four years of age that may be used for breeding.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>colt</FONT></B> is any male <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I>, not gelded, under the age of four years. <B><FONT color=blue>Filly</FONT></B> is the term used of the female <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I> of the same age. Both these words denote race <I><FONT color=brown>horses</FONT></I> in the two-and three-year-old group.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>foal</FONT></B> is a young <I><FONT color=brown>colt</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>filly</FONT></I>. The term is used until the animal is weaned: this normally takes place when the animal is five or six moths old. <I><FONT color=brown>Foal</FONT></I> is also the verb used when a <I><FONT color=brown>mare</FONT></I> gives birth.</P><P>Originally, a <B><FONT color=blue>nag</FONT></B> was a small <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I> used for riding, but the word now emphasizes an old; ill or broken-down animal. <I><FONT color=brown>Nag</FONT></I> is also used humorously of any <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pony</FONT></B> customarily refers to any of several breeds of very small <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I>, usually under 14 hands (about 56 inches) at the shoulder. Breeds such as the Shetland <I><FONT color=brown>pony</FONT></I> and the Welsh <I><FONT color=brown>pony</FONT></I> are usually ridden by small children or used to draw carts. The word is also a regional name in the American West for the <I><FONT color=brown>horses</FONT></I> that are used by cowboys while herding cattle or, in the past, for the <I><FONT color=brown>horses</FONT></I> ridden by Indians.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>cob</FONT></B> is a short-legged, stocky little <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I>, of considerable strength, used either for riding or for pulling a light carriage.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>hunter</FONT></B> is a <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I> that has been trained to carry a person of any weight, as in a fox hunt. He must have great endurance, since a <I><FONT color=brown>hunter</FONT></I> runs for long distances over rough terrain and has to be able to jump fences, streams etc., with ease.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Steed</FONT></B> is a literary term for a spirited war <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I> or one ridden on occasions of state and display: a knight on his richly caparisoned <I><FONT color=brown>steed</FONT></I>; Queen Elizabeth on a coal-back <I><FONT color=brown>steed</FONT></I>. As in the case of <I><FONT color=brown>nag</FONT></I>, steed may also be applied to any mount, especially one of dubious ancestry or ridiculous aspect: The peasant boy’s <I><FONT color=brown>steed</FONT></I> was a lop-eared old donkey with one eye.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Horse</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>colt</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>filly</FONT></I> are sometimes used figuratively of human beings. Horse suggests clumsiness, lack of delicacy, and even gluttony: to stamp up the stairs like a <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I>; to sweat like a <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I>; to eat like a <I><FONT color=brown>horse</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Colt</FONT></I> and its adjective <I><FONT color=brown>coltish</FONT></I> convey the awkward, fresh charm of the older child or young adolescent who is having difficulty in co-ordinating his rapidly growing limbs. When applied to a girl or young woman, <I><FONT color=brown>filly</FONT></I> emphasizes abundant energy and playfulness as contrasted with the sedateness of maturity: an old fool in his sixties trying to make dates with twenty-year-old <I><FONT color=brown>fillies</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Animal">ANIMAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to relatively high temperatures. <B><FONT color=blue>Hot</FONT></B> is the most general and the most relative, depending on context for preciseness: weather <I><FONT color=brown>hot</FONT></I> enough to begin melting off the snowdrifts; <I><FONT color=brown>hot</FONT></I> water; even the coolest star is unimaginably <I><FONT color=brown>hot</FONT></I> by human standards. <B><FONT color=blue>Burning</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>scorching</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>searing</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sizzling</FONT></B> are more specific in referring to temperatures that resemble or are the result of fire. Of these, <I><FONT color=brown>burning</FONT></I> is the most general; it is often used hyperbolically for anything hot or metaphorically or anything high-key: a <I><FONT color=brown>burning</FONT></I> sirocco; <I><FONT color=brown>burning</FONT></I> issues. <I><FONT color=brown>Scorching</FONT></I> is particularly relevant to a <I><FONT color=brown>hot</FONT></I>, dry atmosphere, although the implication of dryness is not always present: the <I><FONT color=brown>scorching</FONT></I> heat of a sauna as compared to the mugginess of a steam bath; <I><FONT color=brown>scorching</FONT></I> weather. Metaphorically, it suggests anger: <I><FONT color=brown>scorching</FONT></I> disdain. <I><FONT color=brown>Searing</FONT></I> always has the sense of severe, dry heat: the searing <I><FONT color=brown>burn</FONT></I> from the red-hot iron; a <I><FONT color=brown>searing</FONT></I> wind dehydrating the skin. <I><FONT color=brown>Sizzling</FONT></I> suggests, often hyperbolically, a <I><FONT color=brown>burning</FONT></I> that give off sparks bathers lying on the <I><FONT color=brown>sizzling</FONT></I> sand; <I><FONT color=brown>sizzling</FONT></I> weather.

Of this group, both <I><FONT color=brown>sultry</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>torrid</FONT></I> have metaphorical uses referring to emotional excitement. <I><FONT color=brown>Sultry</FONT></I> suggests passionate moodiness or intensity, <I><FONT color=brown>torrid</FONT></I> a more specifically sexual context: the <I><FONT color=brown>sultry</FONT></I> beauties in his harem; a <I><FONT color=brown>torrid</FONT></I> affair.</P><P>Feverish, most literally, refers to a high body temperature: He felt faint and feverish.

<P>These words refer to buildings or groups of buildings that are set up to provide living quarters for customers, especially on a temporary basis. <B><FONT color=blue>Hotel</FONT></B> usually refers to a single building, large or small, in which rooms or suites are rented out on a fixed basis: <I><FONT color=brown>hotels</FONT></I> jammed by country visitors at Show time. A <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I> may be licensed (to serve alcoholic beverages) or unlicensed; if the latter, it is known as a private hotel. Although the word most often suggests accommodation for travellers or transients, it may apply also to more permanent arrangements: She had lived in a city <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I> for 15 years. Similar to a private <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I> is the <B><FONT color=blue>guest house</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>boarding house</FONT></B>. These are frequently converted homes or older buildings; they differ in prestige and hence in tariff. The <I><FONT color=brown>guest house</FONT></I>, like the private <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I>, generally caters for short stays but is not quite so elegant. Nevertheless, it is superior to a <I><FONT color=brown>boarding house</FONT></I>, which more usually caters for guests over extended periods, e.g., single workers away from their homes. The term <B><FONT color=blue>pub</FONT></B> (short for public house) may be used informally to designate a hotel in a general sense: [Which <I><FONT color=brown>pub</FONT></I> did you stay at in Rome?], but more often it specifically indicates the bar section of the establishment: a city where the <I><FONT color=brown>pubs</FONT></I> are open till ten o’clock; a no-hoper who spends most of his time in the <I><FONT color=brown>pub</FONT></I>. Of the two words, <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I> places the stronger emphasis on accommodation: every <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I> was booked out for the spring racing carnival.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hostel</FONT></B> represents an older borrowing from the same source word as <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I> and once meant the same thing. Now it refers largely to one of a chain of lodging houses for young people on walking, cycling or motoring tours, or for those residing temporarily in a strange city: He planned his European itinerary so that each night would put him near a different <I><FONT color=brown>hostel</FONT></I>; While in Auckland she stayed at the Y.W.C.A. <I><FONT color=brown>Hostel</FONT></I>. In another sense, the word refers to accommodation provided by a charitable organization for the shelter and care of the aged, incapacitated or destitute: a Salvation Army <I><FONT color=brown>hostel</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Motel</FONT></B> is a portmanteau word for motor <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I>; it refers to a roadside building or, often a group of buildings, such as a cluster of cabins, where people travelling by car may obtain lodgings: an attempt to choose among several <I><FONT color=brown>motels</FONT></I> that lay strung out along the highway. A recent variation of the <I><FONT color=brown>motel</FONT></I> is a seaside <B><FONT color=blue>boatel</FONT></B>, which provides moorings for small craft and overnight accommodation for their owners.</P><P>The old English words <B><FONT color=blue>tavern</FONT></B> and inn refer to establishments whose modern counterparts, broadly speaking, are a licensed restaurant and a <I><FONT color=brown>hotel</FONT></I> respectively. <I><FONT color=brown>Tavern</FONT></I> originally meant a <I><FONT color=brown>public house</FONT></I> offering food and drink (usually wine, as distinct from an alehouse) but not accommodation. As such, it functioned as a local rendezvous and place of recreation. An <I><FONT color=brown>inn</FONT></I> did provide accommodation as well as food and drink, but was not permitted to be used as a mere tippling place. Both words have currency in America although not in Britain itself ?except in the names of many famous <I><FONT color=brown>inns</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>taverns</FONT></I> that have survived through the centuries. Neither word is commonly used in Australia or New Zealand, but, since both have archaic and convivial qualities, they are sometimes used to name any sort of restaurant, licensed or not. <I><FONT color=brown>Inn</FONT></I>, which strongly suggests a rustic setting, sometimes serves as an atmospheric substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>motel</FONT></I>: a motor <I><FONT color=brown>inn</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://House">HOUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Lodgings">LODGINGS</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to structures in which people live or work. <B><FONT color=blue>House</FONT></B> refers generally to any sort of structure meant for living in. though it may classically call up an image of a free-standing, one-family structure of moderate size, it can apply to a whole spectrum of habitations, from those considerably more to those considerably less extensive than this midpoint: the baronet’s fifty-room country <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I>; They bought a split-level house in the new development; a neat little weatherboard <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I>; rows of grimy tenement <I><FONT color=brown>houses</FONT></I>. In informal use the word <B><FONT color=blue>place</FONT></B> refers to where one lives, whether it is a <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I> or a room, flat or other division of a larger structure. A farm may be referred to as one’s <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> in this sense. [She takes the lift to the fifth floor whenever she goes to play at Janie’s <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I>; My <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> is six miles out of town.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dwelling</FONT></B> is a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I> and has fewer connotations, referring solely to any structure (or, less often, to part of one) where people live. Its formality, however, makes it sound odd in other contexts than sociological discussion or the parlance of the building industry: a study that compared children living in suburban separated <I><FONT color=brown>dwellings</FONT></I> with those in inner-city terrace <I><FONT color=brown>houses</FONT></I>; contractors who are equipped to mass-produce middle income <I><FONT color=brown>dwellings</FONT></I> on a vast scale. Even in these uses, the word may sound like an unnecessarily inflated evasion of <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I>. The word also can have an aura of faded lyricism or religiosity, in imitation of its valid use in the King James Bible: the simple <I><FONT color=brown>dwellings</FONT></I> of upright men.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Roof</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>shelter</FONT></B> are more informal and more colourful substitutes for <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>dwelling</FONT></I>, both stressing the minimal factors of utility or protection given by any sort of structure. <I><FONT color=brown>Roof</FONT></I> is a synecdoche for the whole <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I>: two families sharing the same <I><FONT color=brown>roof</FONT></I>. But it may suggest temporary accommodation rather than permanent living quarters: anxious to get a <I><FONT color=brown>roof</FONT></I> over their heads by nightfall. <I><FONT color=brown>Shelter</FONT></I> is useful as a general word with which to group together all living structures, permanent or temporary: man’s basic needs of food, clothing and <I><FONT color=brown>shelter</FONT></I>. It may even refer to any sort of protective retreat: a tree that provided <I><FONT color=brown>shelter</FONT></I> from the rain; to take <I><FONT color=brown>shelter</FONT></I>. Used as a specific reference to a particular structure, it is likely to suggest something rude or improvised: They collected driftwood to build a beach <I><FONT color=brown>shelter</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Housing</FONT></B> is a general word referring to the supplying of or demand for living space of any sort: a new <I><FONT color=brown>housing</FONT></I> development on the edge of the city; legislation in the areas of <I><FONT color=brown>housing</FONT></I> and education.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Building</FONT></B> refers concretely to an actual structure, but it is not restricted, like house, to those designed or used as living space: farm buildings that included the farmhouse, a milking shed and a silo. <B><FONT color=blue>Premises</FONT></B> is a technical term in insurance, legal or criminological parlances. It may refer to a tract of land with buildings on it; to a <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I>, building or part of a <I><FONT color=brown>house</FONT></I>; or to the space occupied by a business: a policy insuring the <I><FONT color=brown>premises</FONT></I> against fire; suspicious characters seen on the <I><FONT color=brown>premises</FONT></I>. Sometimes it is used outside these contexts with comic effect: He got his golf clubs from the cupboard in the hope of getting off the <I><FONT color=brown>premises</FONT></I> without being seen.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Home">HOME</A>, <A href="entry://Hotel">HOTEL</A>, <A href="entry://Lodgings">LODGINGS</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in the broad sense of having an interest in or concern for the welfare and happiness of others. <B><FONT color=blue>Humane</FONT></B>, the most comprehensive of them, implies considerateness in our dealings not only with people but with all living creatures and in situations involving either: a <I><FONT color=brown>humane</FONT></I> judge; a <I><FONT color=brown>humane</FONT></I> treatment of animals; a <I><FONT color=brown>humane</FONT></I> management policy. <B><FONT color=blue>Benign</FONT></B> carries the suggestion of a mild, sometimes faintly condescending gentleness and tolerance, with a secondary meaning of harmlessness: a <I><FONT color=brown>benign</FONT></I> attitude towards the follies of others; a <I><FONT color=brown>benign</FONT></I> tumour.</P><P>Etymologically, <B><FONT color=blue>sympathetic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>compassionate</FONT></B> mean the same thing: felling or suffering, usually with another person. But <I><FONT color=brown>sympathetic</FONT></I>, from the Greek, has a wider, frequently more generalized and impersonal range than the Latin <I><FONT color=brown>compassionate</FONT></I>. One can be <I><FONT color=brown>sympathetic</FONT></I> with a point of view, a philosophy, belief or way of life, or feel sympathy for the hardships of a fictional character; but <I><FONT color=brown>compassionate</FONT></I> implies a stronger and more directly personal feeling for suffering and misfortune at the individual level: His own experiences had taught him to be <I><FONT color=brown>compassionate</FONT></I> towards lonely and misunderstood children.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Charitable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>humanitarian</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>philanthropic</FONT></B> all suggest a sense of obligation to aspects of life that are, or are regarded as, worthy of generous understanding and practical help. A <I><FONT color=brown>charitable</FONT></I> person is disposed to show a kindly and merciful attitude towards people in distress and to help them when and where possible. A <I><FONT color=brown>humanitarian</FONT></I> will generalize his interest in mankind along <I><FONT color=brown>philosophic</FONT></I> and often vaguely sentimental lines that disregard the individual in favour of the mass. A <I><FONT color=brown>philanthropic</FONT></I> person may be <I><FONT color=brown>charitable</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>humanitarian</FONT></I>, but has both the capacity and desire to be useful by giving large sums of money to specific causes, institutions, foundations, etc.</P><P>In all these distinctions the word <B><FONT color=blue>human</FONT></B> is a rock-bottom term that can be used wherever men are thought of apart from animals and inanimate nature and are regarded as capable of concern for and communication with others: a drop of <I><FONT color=brown>human</FONT></I> kindness. <I><FONT color=brown>Human</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>humane</FONT></I> are very different in their implications, however. <I><FONT color=brown>Humane</FONT></I> can suggest an attitude of impersonal high-mindedness, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>human</FONT></I> can often gloss over weakness or failings as being all too common and, therefore, forgivable.

<B><FONT color=blue>humid</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>close</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>oppressive</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sticky</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are comparable in that they are all used to describe a condition of the weather. <B><FONT color=blue>Humid</FONT></B>, which means containing water or vapour, is the most specific term in the group because it refers to a measurable physical phenomenon called relative humidity. Relative humidity is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the amount of water vapour actually in the air at a specific time to the total amount which could be present at the same temperature. <I><FONT color=brown>Humid</FONT></I>, therefore, alone or with a qualifying adverb can designate any state of atmospheric dampness: It was not <I><FONT color=brown>humid</FONT></I> yesterday, but it is very <I><FONT color=brown>humid</FONT></I> today and the weather bureau predicts that it will be even more <I><FONT color=brown>humid</FONT></I> tomorrow.</P><P>The other words in this group are less precise in meaning but distinctly more colourful in tone. <B><FONT color=blue>Close</FONT></B> can refer to the weather or to a place. When one thinks of a <I><FONT color=brown>close</FONT></I> day it is in terms of being choked or suffocated by weather that is heavy, hot and airless. A room described as <I><FONT color=brown>close</FONT></I> has probably not been ventilated for some time; its unmoving air has grown stale and thick so that it induces an uncomfortable feeling of confinement. <B><FONT color=blue>Oppressive</FONT></B> is the most general of these words; it can apply to any kind of harsh weather that causes depression or discomfort. A <I><FONT color=brown>close</FONT></I> day with a thunderstorm lurking and no breeze stirring is certainly <I><FONT color=brown>oppressive</FONT></I>. But so, too, is a day on which the wind never stops blowing, whether it be hot or cold, rainy or dry. It is true that <I><FONT color=brown>oppressive</FONT></I> is mostly used in reference to hot, sultry weather, but any climatic condition that produces a state of oppression can be characterized by this word: The unusually mild autumn was followed abruptly by two weeks of <I><FONT color=brown>oppressive</FONT></I>, freezing weather that kept all but the hardiest souls indoors.</P><P>In this context, <B><FONT color=blue>sticky</FONT></B> refers to sweatiness caused by an <I><FONT color=brown>oppressive</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>humid</FONT></I> warmth that does not permit evaporation; this may result from weather, an unventilated atmosphere, or from exertion. An implication pertaining to the adhesiveness between layers, as of cloth to sweaty skin, may also be present: a <I><FONT color=brown>sticky</FONT></I> day; an overcrowded room that soon became damp and <I><FONT color=brown>sticky</FONT></I>; He stripped off his <I><FONT color=brown>sticky</FONT></I> gym clothes.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hot">HOT</A>, <A href="entry://Warm">WARM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: arid, <A href="entry://Dry">DRY</A>, parched.</P>

<P>These words refer to what causes or is intended to cause amusement or laughter. <B><FONT color=blue>Humorous</FONT></B> is most often restricted to successful attempts to amuse or to people who succeed in such attempts: a <I><FONT color=brown>humorous</FONT></I> story; a <I><FONT color=brown>humorous</FONT></I> fellow, full of diverting remarks. Less often, the word can refer only to the attempt: His <I><FONT color=brown>humorous</FONT></I> essays are not half so amusing as those of Thurber. The word seldom refers to a warm-hearted sympathetic or good-natured treatment of small failings or ironies, those that prompt smiles rather than laughter or derision.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Comic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>comical</FONT></B> relate instead to comedy, which can include the humorous but is a more general category, including slapstick, parody or even caustic satire. <I><FONT color=brown>Comic</FONT></I> is a neutral word by which to refer to this category: <I><FONT color=brown>comic</FONT></I> writers. <I><FONT color=brown>Comic</FONT></I>, in fact, is now often used as a noun to refer to any comedian: nightclub comics. <I><FONT color=brown>Comical</FONT></I>, by contrast, can refer to anything or anyone whose effect is amusing, laughable or absurd, whether such an effect is intentional or not: a <I><FONT color=brown>comical</FONT></I> misunderstanding that delighted the spectators but caused the embarrassed delegates to call for a recess; he cut a <I><FONT color=brown>comical</FONT></I> figure in his pretentious finery. These distinctions are not always observed in the use of the two words.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Funny</FONT></B> is the most general of these words and the most informal, but it is focused mainly on whatever results in laughter: a comedian whose jokes weren’t really very <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I>; a howlingly <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I> slip of the tongue. When something or someone is inadvertently <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I>, it may be because of oddness, unfamiliarity, abnormality or inappropriateness: the <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I> old man with the <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I> walk. This shades off into a description of any thing strange or suspicious: His wife gave him a <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I> look. On the other hand, the word can categorize an attempt, like comic: professional <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I> men; <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I> business that was tedious and overdone. <B><FONT color=blue>Facetious</FONT></B> once could be approving, but now is often an unfavourable description or silly or ill-timed attempts at the <I><FONT color=brown>humorous</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>facetious</FONT></I> ass who always forgot the punch lines to the jokes he told; <I><FONT color=brown>facetious</FONT></I> remarks that kept sidetracking any serious discussion of the problem.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Jocose</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>jocular</FONT></B> are the most formal words here and closely related in meaning. Both come from Latin roots meaning jest or joke and both can apply to a person given to jesting or to the amusement caused by such remarks. <I><FONT color=brown>Jocose</FONT></I> can sometimes function as a milder substitute for facetious, pointing to feeble attempts at humour, especially when they are heavy-handed or pompous: <I><FONT color=brown>jocose</FONT></I> inanities that were stuffy and old-hat. <I><FONT color=brown>Jocular</FONT></I> may imply a constant resort to jokes or wisecracks in the hope of cheering up or amusing others: <I><FONT color=brown>jocular</FONT></I> comments on the bad food and worse weather. It may sometimes apply to the deliberate turning away of a serious question by a light answer: the <I><FONT color=brown>jocular</FONT></I> anecdote with which he disposed of the young man’s objection.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Droll</FONT></B> compares with one aspect of funny in pointing to someone who is whimsical or odd: the <I><FONT color=brown>droll</FONT></I> old curmudgeon. It can also refer to a comic impulse that is clever, deadpan or laconic: the <I><FONT color=brown>droll</FONT></I> understatement of the British. It can also refer to comic work that is in a mordant or sardonic vein: Balzac’s <I><FONT color=brown>Droll</FONT></I> Stories. <B><FONT color=blue>Waggish</FONT></B> can also indicate humour that is clever, but the word also suggests a playful irreverence in someone given to in-jokes or sly rejoinders: <I><FONT color=brown>waggish</FONT></I> remarks about the poor lady’s grotesque and comical evening gown. <B><FONT color=blue>Witty</FONT></B> is more inclusive than <I><FONT color=brown>droll</FONT></I> or waggish in pointing to a brilliant or surprising play of intelligence in the delivery of amusing and trenchant observations on human foibles or follies: Oscar Wilde’s <I><FONT color=brown>witty</FONT></I> repartee; a <I><FONT color=brown>witty</FONT></I> parody of television commercials. <I><FONT color=brown>Witty</FONT></I> can apply as well to the light and good-natured, like humorous, as to the caustic and withering: <I><FONT color=brown>witty</FONT></I> conundrums about trivialities; <I><FONT color=brown>witty</FONT></I> aspersions that cast doubt on the sincerity and competence of the playwright.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Absurd">ABSURD</A>, <A href="entry://Joke">JOKE</A>, <A href="entry://Laugh">LAUGH</A>, <A href="entry://Ridicule">RIDICULE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dull, <A href="entry://Gloomy">GLOOMY</A>, <A href="entry://Sedate">SEDATE</A>.</P>

<P>These words indicate any effort at finding, catching, following or examining something. Hunt at its most specific can refer to the specific activity of pursuing and killing animals, whether for food, profit or sport: Aborigines who hunted kangaroos for food; on a safari to hunt game. More generally, the word can indicate an uncertain groping for something needed: He hunted for the light switch along the wall of the dark room. It can also indicate an urgent following: She hunted everywhere in the neighbourhood for the tardy child. And it can point to any act of looking for something lost or missing: hunting for the missing book.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Track</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sleuth</FONT></B> relate closely to the aspect of hunt pertaining to following a quarry. <I><FONT color=brown>Track</FONT></I> can indicate the ability to detect a trail of clues: Red Indians skilled at <I><FONT color=brown>tracking</FONT></I> the spoor of a wounded bison. It can also apply more widely for hunting anything fugitive or difficult to find: determined to <I><FONT color=brown>track</FONT></I> down every suspicious item in the expense account submitted ho him. <I><FONT color=brown>Sleuth</FONT></I> compares such action to detective work and can apply as widely. But here the word refers more often to the search for clues itself, particularly where the quarry is not yet known: They <I><FONT color=brown>sleuthed</FONT></I> out every angle, however, slight, that could lead them to the killer; clinicians to <I><FONT color=brown>sleuth</FONT></I> down symptoms that might help diagnose the strange illness.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Search</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>seek</FONT></B> are considerably more general than the previous pair. <I><FONT color=brown>Search</FONT></I> may indicate the act of looking for a lost object or for an object presumed to exist: navigators <I><FONT color=brown>searching</FONT></I> for a western route to the East Indies. The word may also apply to mere activity without clearly stated goals: young people <I><FONT color=brown>searching</FONT></I> for a cause that would give meaning to their lives. Hunt, by comparison with <I><FONT color=brown>search</FONT></I>, might suggest a more informed, purposive, focused or relentless activity: They cordoned off the factory and methodically hunted down the trapped thieves. <I><FONT color=brown>Seek</FONT></I> can give a more archaic flavour than <I><FONT color=brown>search</FONT></I>, except in set phrases: <I><FONT color=brown>seek</FONT></I> and find; <I><FONT color=brown>seek</FONT></I> and destroy; <I><FONT color=brown>seeking</FONT></I> out directions, a place or a person. The word can also indicate vague desires or high-minded aspirations; negotiators <I><FONT color=brown>seeking</FONT></I> the good of all mankind; peacemakers who have always <I><FONT color=brown>sought</FONT></I> an end to war.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Explore</FONT></B> is like the aspect of search pertaining to activity that does not or cannot have a precisely stated goal in advance. <I><FONT color=brown>Explore</FONT></I> is much more clear-cut about this, since it always implies an attempt to learn more about an unknown: Livingstone was the first European to <I><FONT color=brown>explore</FONT></I> the Zambesi River; the thrill of <I><FONT color=brown>exploring</FONT></I> the streets of a strange city; an operation to <I><FONT color=brown>explore</FONT></I> the tissue surrounding the tumour for any signs of malignancy. The action indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>explore</FONT></I> can, of course, have a stated general goal, but some sense of newness or unfamiliarity is always present in the word.</P><P>The remaining words all involve the notion of a thorough or meticulous search of an area for evidence or for something lost or presumed to exist: <B><FONT color=blue>Comb</FONT></B> indicates a methodical, careful, minute and orderly covering of possibilities, often giving a tone of desperation and sometimes implying a group search: a <I><FONT color=brown>search</FONT></I> party that <I><FONT color=brown>combed</FONT></I> the hills for the missing campers. <B><FONT color=blue>Scour</FONT></B> compares to comb in thoroughness, but may suggest greater effort or intensity: The <I><FONT color=brown>scoured</FONT></I> the grounds for the missing keys. Although these words can be used interchangeably, <I><FONT color=brown>comb</FONT></I> might be more appropriate for small areas, since <I><FONT color=brown>scour</FONT></I> here can confusingly suggest the literal actions of abrasion. <B><FONT color=blue>Ransack</FONT></B> indicates a strikingly different action, comparable in thoroughness, but implying a hasty, careless or disorderly <I><FONT color=brown>search</FONT></I>: The had broken in and <I><FONT color=brown>ransacked</FONT></I> the darkroom for the incriminating roll of film, leaving the place a total mess. The word most often suggests the <I><FONT color=brown>search</FONT></I> of an interior, such as a house, room or drawer, and can often point to a furtive or illegal action.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Examine">EXAMINE</A>, <A href="entry://Find">FIND</A>, <A href="entry://Follow">FOLLOW</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>husky</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>beefy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>brawny</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>burly</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hulking</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stocky</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>strapping</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to strong, heavy, powerfully built or masculine physiques. <B><FONT color=blue>Husky</FONT></B> refers to masculine muscularity. It derives from husk, referring to the tough covering shell of a seed; also its other uses pertaining to dryness, roughness or hoarseness give connotations here. While the word suggests largeness of frame, it is more emphatic about the strength or muscular density of physique, particularly of the torso, with suggestions of coarseness or toughness. Thus, it serves as an antonym to lithe or supple and implies instead a possibly slower-moving but more powerful body: the lithe physique best for runners and tennis players as compared to the <I><FONT color=brown>husky</FONT></I> builds required for wrestling or shot-put.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brawny</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>burly</FONT></B> both intensify the emphasis of husky on massive or dense muscular development, suggesting in these cases a grossness of build beyond that of any well-proportioned and cleanly defined athletic ideal. <I><FONT color=brown>Burly</FONT></I> may carry connotations over from another word, identical in form, that refers to the knots and burls of a tree, in this case suggesting a thick bunching of muscles that may verge on the grotesque; an overall thickness of frame, at an rate, is implied, with suggestions of coarse or crude power that are even stronger than those for <I><FONT color=brown>husky</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>burly</FONT></I>, lumbering wharf labourer with the thick bullneck and barrel-shaped chest. <I><FONT color=brown>Brawny</FONT></I> is less extreme in its implications than burly, emphasizing instead the sheer power inherent in muscular development. Where <I><FONT color=brown>husky</FONT></I> may particularly point to a developed torso, <I><FONT color=brown>brawny</FONT></I> suggests general muscular density, such as acquired by hard physical labour: a <I><FONT color=brown>brawny</FONT></I> axeman.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Beefy</FONT></B> points to muscular masses but, unlike the previous words, need not indicate power or density. The word can in fact suggest a fleshy grossness that may be repellent or flabby: the dance hall’s <I><FONT color=brown>beefy</FONT></I> bouncer. <B><FONT color=blue>Hulking</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stocky</FONT></B> both suggest sheer size or largeness of frame rather than pointing primarily to muscular development. <I><FONT color=brown>Hulking</FONT></I> particularly indicates a tall or looming male build: a <I><FONT color=brown>hulking</FONT></I> basketball player. <I><FONT color=brown>Stocky</FONT></I>, by contrast, emphasizes largeness rather than tallness of frame: a <I><FONT color=brown>stocky</FONT></I> publican almost as wide as he was tall. Even more than <I><FONT color=brown>husky</FONT></I>, this word can be used euphemistically for a fat or heavy body: a reducing clinic for <I><FONT color=brown>stocky</FONT></I> executives. <B><FONT color=blue>Strapping</FONT></B> combines the suggestions of sheer size in the last pair with the stress on muscular development in the first group. The word is often used to indicate precocious growth and development in boys or young men: a <I><FONT color=brown>strapping</FONT></I>, blond surfie.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Masculine">MASCULINE</A>, <A href="entry://Physical">PHYSICAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Thin">THIN</A>.</P>

<P>All these words denote something that exists in the mind during the processes of perceiving, thinking or willing. <B><FONT color=blue>Idea</FONT></B> is the most general term, applicable to almost any part or aspect of mental activity. [The <I><FONT color=brown>idea</FONT></I> of death is frightening to most people; I had no <I><FONT color=brown>idea</FONT></I> of going to the party; She has a general <I><FONT color=brown>idea</FONT></I> of the cost of the repair job.] A <B><FONT color=blue>concept</FONT></B> is an <I><FONT color=brown>idea</FONT></I> of a category or kind that has been generalized from particular instances. Thus, the <I><FONT color=brown>concept</FONT></I> of "cat" arises from the many cats we see. <I><FONT color=brown>Concept</FONT></I> also refers to a widely held <I><FONT color=brown>idea</FONT></I> of what something is or should be: The <I><FONT color=brown>concept</FONT></I> of government of many small nations has been influenced by the legislative and judicial institutions of Britain. The meaning of <B><FONT color=blue>conception</FONT></B> is much like this second sense of <I><FONT color=brown>concept</FONT></I>, but differs in that the <I><FONT color=brown>idea</FONT></I> of what a thing is or should be is here held by an individual or small group and is often coloured by imagination and feeling: A child’s <I><FONT color=brown>conception</FONT></I> of the universe is formed by his limited experience and his own fancies. A <B><FONT color=blue>thought</FONT></B> is an <I><FONT color=brown>idea</FONT></I> based on intellectual activity, and is not directly attributable to a sense impression: He has many <I><FONT color=brown>thoughts</FONT></I> on the matter. A <B><FONT color=blue>notion</FONT></B> is a vague or capricious <I><FONT color=brown>idea</FONT></I>, often without any sound basis: to have a <I><FONT color=brown>notion</FONT></I> that the share market will rise. An <B><FONT color=blue>impression</FONT></B> is an idea that arises from something external. It suggests either a half-formed mental picture or a superficial view or conclusion. [An infant may have the <I><FONT color=brown>impression</FONT></I> that its father is a giant; My <I><FONT color=brown>impression</FONT></I> is that he was lying.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Opinion">OPINION</A>.</P>

<P>These words are alike in describing persons or actions regarded as being far below common worth or dignity. <B><FONT color=blue>Ignoble</FONT></B> and mean originally meant of low birth but they are seldom used today to refer to social status. <I><FONT color=brown>Ignoble</FONT></I> denotes a lack or loss of noble or praiseworthy qualities, and frequently implies a failure to meet ordinarily accepted standards of worth or excellence: the <I><FONT color=brown>ignoble</FONT></I> betrayal of a trust. <B><FONT color=blue>Mean</FONT></B> suggests a contemptible smallness of mind, or a petty, ungenerous nature: the repeat <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I> gossip. <B><FONT color=blue>Beggarly</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cheap</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>shabby</FONT></B> are close to <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I> in connotation, each suggesting the same nasty, sordid vulgarity. While <I><FONT color=brown>ignoble</FONT></I> could possibly describe the act of a person from whom we might expect a better sort of conduct, <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>beggarly</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>cheap</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>shabby</FONT></I> describe persons or actions for which we feel only scorn and disdain: a miserly landlord’s <I><FONT color=brown>beggarly</FONT></I> treatment of an indigent tenant; the <I><FONT color=brown>cheap</FONT></I> quarrelling of two brothers whose father had died intestate; the <I><FONT color=brown>shabby</FONT></I> charges and counter-charged of rival political candidates. <B><FONT color=blue>Base</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>low</FONT></B> are alike in being strong words used to condemn that which is openly evil, selfish, dishonourable or otherwise unmoral.

imagination
<B><FONT color=blue>imagination</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fancy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fantasy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>reverie</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the mind’s power to call up image, to picture or conceive things that are not actually before the eye or within the experience. At one time, <B><FONT color=blue>imagination</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>fancy</FONT></B> could be used interchangeably, but now the two terms are sharply distinguished both in application and in scope. Used in the broad sense of a basic mental faculty, <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I> encompasses <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I> is a playful or whimsical sort of <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I>. Used in a restricted sense, <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I> contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I> applies to the higher, creative faculty and <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I> is limited to a capriciously inventive play of mind. More serious in purpose than the <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I>, the higher <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I> creates a new form of reality, bodying forth things unknown or new by recombining the products of past experience. The <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I> is freer and more frivolous, following its whims and ranging farther from reality: unbridled <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I>; a flight of <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I>. Where the higher <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I> creates vivid characters that are true to life, such as Hamlet, Falstaff and King Lear, the <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I> dreams up delightful, non-existent beings, such as elves, fairies and woodland sprites. <I><FONT color=brown>Imagination</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I> are also used to contrast false or misleading <I><FONT color=brown>impressions</FONT></I> with truth or reality. [No one moved in the bushes; it was only your <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I>; Was it fact or <I><FONT color=brown>fancy</FONT></I>?]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fantasy</FONT></B> is <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I> divorced from reality. The creations of <I><FONT color=brown>fantasy</FONT></I> may be delightfully bizarre or may be weird and grotesque, as in the case of science-fiction stories depicting monstrous men from Mars. Engaged in <I><FONT color=brown>fantasy</FONT></I>, the <I><FONT color=brown>imagination</FONT></I> projects unreal images or imaginary senses on the screen of the mind, creating a dream world. [An amusement park full of figures from fairy tales may be called <I><FONT color=brown>Fantasy</FONT></I>land; In his <I><FONT color=brown>fantasies</FONT></I>, the meek little man was a bold, brave hero.] <I><FONT color=brown>Fantasy</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>reverie</FONT></B> both involve a withdrawal from the real world during which the mind is focused on its own imaginings; but, whereas in <I><FONT color=brown>fantasy</FONT></I> there is an element of escapism, in <I><FONT color=brown>reverie</FONT></I> the mind is not actively fleeting reality but is simply not conscious of the world without. A <I><FONT color=brown>fantasy</FONT></I> is a vivid daydream directed like a drama by the mind. <I><FONT color=brown>Reverie</FONT></I> is an undirected wandering of the mind ?an abstracted, dreamlike state during which fancies, <I><FONT color=brown>fantasies</FONT></I>, memories or other imaginings preoccupy the mind and free it from conscious control.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artistic">ARTISTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Creative">CREATIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Delusion">DELUSION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: actuality, fact, reality, truth.</P>

<P>These words refer to reproducing the style or characteristics of something taken as a model. <B><FONT color=blue>Imitate</FONT></B> is the most general and neutral of these, referring to any attempt to repeat convincingly or tellingly the recognizable features of the model; this may be done unconsciously because of a lack of originality, semi-consciously out of admiration, or consciously as satire: He hadn’t realized how much he tended to <I><FONT color=brown>imitate</FONT></I> his father’s way of talking; a writer who slavishly <I><FONT color=brown>imitated</FONT></I> the words of his favourite poet, Keats; a brilliant parody that <I><FONT color=brown>imitated</FONT></I> the acting of movie queens from the silent era. The word may also point to a conscious attempt at a serious resemblance for other than satiric effect: novelists who strive to <I><FONT color=brown>imitate</FONT></I> the speech patterns of real people; that phrase about art <I><FONT color=brown>imitating</FONT></I> life. The word may also suggest following some example-setting precedent: women who <I><FONT color=brown>imitated</FONT></I> the new British hairstyles.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Copy</FONT></B> stresses a conscious or at least semi-conscious process; this may be done merely to duplicate information: He <I><FONT color=brown>copied</FONT></I> the relevant data out of the encyclopaedia. It may also, like <I><FONT color=brown>imitate</FONT></I>, suggest following an admired or fashionable model: They copied in dress and speech the oldest member of their gang. Often, however, the word suggests some sort of unethical appropriation: He found himself <I><FONT color=brown>copying</FONT></I> his neighbour’s answers during the gruelling exam. In a related context, the word can also refer to mere mechanical duplication: the office <I><FONT color=brown>copying</FONT></I> machine.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Impersonate</FONT></B> exclusively concentrates on a specific aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>imitate</FONT></I>; it refers to the assuming of another person’s mannerisms or appearance, either for the amusement of others or to perpetrate a real fraud: a night-club entertainer who could <I><FONT color=brown>impersonate</FONT></I> half a dozen famous stars with amazing verisimilitude; a crime to <I><FONT color=brown>impersonate</FONT></I> a policeman. <B><FONT color=blue>Mimic</FONT></B>, in turn, concentrates on one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>impersonate</FONT></I>, namely, the acting out of someone else’s mannerisms for humorous, or even satiric, effect: She savagely <I><FONT color=brown>mimicked</FONT></I> the nasal whine of their teacher; a number in which he <I><FONT color=brown>mimicked</FONT></I> the vocal styles of several famous singers. Sometimes the word is used contemptuously for any <I><FONT color=brown>imitating</FONT></I> of a style or vogue: a rash of local singers struggling to <I><FONT color=brown>mimic</FONT></I> the Beatles.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ape</FONT></B> is related to this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>mimic</FONT></I>, but can refer either to a conscious, contemptuous caricature or to less conscious, but slavish, adherence to faddish models: They howled with laughter at the way he <I><FONT color=brown>aped</FONT></I> the receptionist’s la-di-la voice; adults who desperately try to <I><FONT color=brown>ape</FONT></I> the latest dance crazes of the young.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Caricature">CARICATURE</A>, <A href="entry://Copy">COPY</A>, <A href="entry://Duplicate">DUPLICATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, originate.</P>

<P>These words refer to the forceful pushing of something into water or another liquid. <B><FONT color=blue>Immerse</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>submerge</FONT></B> are the most formal of these words and are the most general in range of meaning. <I><FONT color=brown>Immerse</FONT></I> indicates the lowering of something into water so that all of it is below surface: denominations that believe a person must be completely <I><FONT color=brown>immersed</FONT></I> in order to be properly baptized; She <I><FONT color=brown>immersed</FONT></I> the cabbage in boiling water, but, in this case, the word often suggests an object’s being lowered to a greater depth than necessarily suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>immerse</FONT></I>: They weighted the old boat with rocks to keep it <I><FONT color=brown>submerged</FONT></I> at the bottom of the lake. Furthermore, the word now often suggests the self-propelled sinking that is the case with a submarine: able to fire Polaris missiles while <I><FONT color=brown>submerged</FONT></I>.</P><P>The remaining words are much more informal and refer specifically to distinct kinds of <I><FONT color=brown>immersing</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>submerging</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Plunge</FONT></B> suggests rapid and forceful motion, but not necessarily to any great depth: <I><FONT color=brown>plunging</FONT></I> the bunch of celery in water several times and shaking it vigorously; <I><FONT color=brown>plunging</FONT></I> from the overhanging cliff in a beautiful, arching dive. <B><FONT color=blue>Dunk</FONT></B> most concretely suggests a partial lowering of something into a liquid; unlike <I><FONT color=brown>plunge</FONT></I>, the motion may be slow and gentle: to <I><FONT color=brown>dunk</FONT></I> a doughnut in coffee. <B><FONT color=blue>Dip</FONT></B> may suggest any kind of partial lowering but most often, perhaps, would suggest a cautious, tentative movement: She <I><FONT color=brown>dipped</FONT></I> a toe in the water to see how cold it was. The word may also apply to a brief but complete lowering: Easter eggs made by <I><FONT color=brown>dipping</FONT></I> them in bowls of food colouring. <B><FONT color=blue>Duck</FONT></B> now suggests the prankish forcing of someone’s head under water, as when both have gone for a swim: His father warned him not to <I><FONT color=brown>duck</FONT></I> his younger brother again if he wished to stay in the pool.</P><P>While <B><FONT color=blue>douse</FONT></B> can apply like <I><FONT color=brown>plunge</FONT></I>, it more often indicates an action in sharp contrast with those indicated by other words in this group. The liquid in this case is poured or sprinkled over something else so as to drench, soak or cover it; the only movement involved may be the downpour of water itself. [We got thoroughly <I><FONT color=brown>doused</FONT></I> by the sudden thunderstorm; He <I><FONT color=brown>doused</FONT></I> the face of the unconscious woman with a glass of cold water.] The word can even refer to a thorough soaking, however applied: plum pudding <I><FONT color=brown>doused</FONT></I> in brandy.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Permeate">PERMEATE</A>, <A href="entry://Wet">WET</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>immortal</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>deathless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>imperishable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>undying</FONT></B>:

<P>These words apply to what cannot or will never die. <B><FONT color=blue>Immortal</FONT></B> is the word most likely to be used in theological discussion concerning the soul or the Deity: man’s <I><FONT color=brown>immortal</FONT></I> soul; the <I><FONT color=brown>immortal</FONT></I> gods of the Greek pantheon. The word is also used loosely for any human accomplishment that seems particularly durable: the <I><FONT color=brown>immortal</FONT></I> works of Voltaire. The word may also apply to the creator: the <I><FONT color=brown>immortal</FONT></I> Shakespeare; the <I><FONT color=brown>immortal</FONT></I> Jane Austen. <B><FONT color=blue>Deathless</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>undying</FONT></B> are both more lyrical in tone, but both can function in the same theological or hyperbolic ways as <I><FONT color=brown>immortal</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Deathless</FONT></I> was popular in the Romantic Age to typify aspiration or achievement but may now sound rhetorical and high-flown; sometimes it refers pejoratively to such uses: a lady with three names who wrote <I><FONT color=brown>deathless</FONT></I> prose. Undying is less open to the charge of pretentiousness, partly because it is an accepted hyperbole for lasting sentiments as well as achievements: <I><FONT color=brown>undying</FONT></I> love; From that moment on he felt <I><FONT color=brown>undying</FONT></I> hatred for his oppressors.</P><P>While <B><FONT color=blue>imperishable</FONT></B> can also be used in ways identical to <I><FONT color=brown>immortal</FONT></I>, with a possible gain in vividness, the word can also indicate anything not subject to change or decay. When applied to something that is long lasting but is not, in any case, subject to physical death, <I><FONT color=brown>imperishable</FONT></I> may be more precise than the previous words: the <I><FONT color=brown>imperishable</FONT></I> Elgin marbles; the <I><FONT color=brown>imperishable</FONT></I> will of man to survive and excel; a universe in which only matter and energy can be said to be <I><FONT color=brown>imperishable</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Everlasting">EVERLASTING</A>, <A href="entry://Immutable">IMMUTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Infinite">INFINITE</A>, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: mortal, perishable <A href="entry://Temporary">TEMPORARY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to what does not change or to what cannot be changed. <B><FONT color=blue>Immutable</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words and refers strictly to what cannot be changed. The word often applies approvingly to a truth or principle that is not affected by fashion or the passage of time: the <I><FONT color=brown>immutable</FONT></I> Golden Rule; the <I><FONT color=brown>immutable</FONT></I> justice and mercy of God. In referring to things beyond the scale of human impermanence, the word need not always be approving, though it may connote humility or awe in recognizing them: the <I><FONT color=brown>immutable</FONT></I> physical laws of the universe. <B><FONT color=blue>Unchangeable</FONT></B> is a more informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>immutable</FONT></I>, but it also applies more widely to anything not subject to alteration: <I><FONT color=brown>unchangeable</FONT></I> hereditary traits. Often the word can be used disapprovingly of things that are too inflexible or rigid to permit vigour or growth: an <I><FONT color=brown>unchangeable</FONT></I> social order that stifled individuality.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fixed</FONT></B> can indicate something that appears in an <I><FONT color=brown>immutable</FONT></I> order: early astronomers who distinguished between the wandering planets and the <I><FONT color=brown>fixed</FONT></I> stars. But the word can apply within the human scale, whether positively or negatively, to anything set, predetermined, habitual or rigid: a child’s personality is <I><FONT color=brown>fixed</FONT></I> in the first five years of life; a man of <I><FONT color=brown>fixed</FONT></I> opinions; a <I><FONT color=brown>fixed</FONT></I> stare. <B><FONT color=blue>Indestructible</FONT></B>, at its most literal, refers neutrally to what can never cease to exist: earlier theories that matter was <I><FONT color=brown>indestructible</FONT></I>. As a hyperbole, the word can refer approvingly to anything that withstands decay or change: the <I><FONT color=brown>indestructible</FONT></I> pyramids; He fought on against overwhelming odds with an <I><FONT color=brown>indestructible</FONT></I> determination to win the battle.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unfading</FONT></B> can occasionally refer to materials that are colour-fast, but much more commonly, the word refers in a general way to anything that retains its vividness over a long period of time: the <I><FONT color=brown>unfading</FONT></I> memory of their first meeting. The remaining words stress what does not change, for whatever reason, rather than something that cannot be changed. <B><FONT color=blue>Unchanging</FONT></B> can merely indicate what is lasting: <I><FONT color=brown>unchanging</FONT></I> love. But it can be more specific in a series or sequence, each item of which resembles every other: <I><FONT color=brown>unchanging</FONT></I> summer days; the tenderness and simplicity with which they moved through the <I><FONT color=brown>unchanging</FONT></I> ritual of their days. The word can also be disapproving in this sense: an <I><FONT color=brown>unchanging</FONT></I> routine that made him want to scream with boredom. <B><FONT color=blue>Unvarying</FONT></B> points almost exclusively to identical items in a series. The word can be neutral or approving: He pronounced each word with <I><FONT color=brown>unvarying</FONT></I> precision. But it is often negative, with even greater force than <I><FONT color=brown>unchanging</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>unvarying</FONT></I> daily round of their humdrum lives.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Everlasting">EVERLASTING</A>, <A href="entry://Immortal">IMMORTAL</A>, <A href="entry://Invariable">INVARIABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: changing, fading, <A href="entry://Inconstant">INCONSTANT</A>, <A href="entry://Temporary">TEMPORARY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the energy with which objects are propelled, bear down or collide. <B><FONT color=blue>Impact</FONT></B> is specifically restricted to an emphasis on the moment or point of contact between objects, one or both of which have been in motion: the <I><FONT color=brown>impact</FONT></I> of the meteorite on the earth’s surface; the <I><FONT color=brown>impact</FONT></I> of two speeding cars. In emphasizing the contact itself, the word remains relative about the amount of stress developed: the faint <I><FONT color=brown>impact</FONT></I> of rain on his forehead; the mile-wide crater that would result from the <I><FONT color=brown>impact</FONT></I> and explosion of the bomb. The word is often used metaphorically for any effect: the <I><FONT color=brown>impact</FONT></I> of a tax cut on the economy. Here, again, the word remains relative about the amount of effect engendered. The more formal <B><FONT color=blue>concussion</FONT></B> is closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>impact</FONT></I> in stressing collision, but is even more specific, referring to the considerable destructive energy released, usually with resulting damage of a temporary or permanent nature, as in its reference to brain damage from a blow: suffered a <I><FONT color=brown>concussion</FONT></I> in the car accident that would heave him paralysed for life. Even outside this specific use, it suggests a violent <I><FONT color=brown>impact</FONT></I>: delicate instruments that could not survive the <I><FONT color=brown>concussion</FONT></I> of any hard landing on the moon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Jolt</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>shock</FONT></B> are more informal than the previous words. They are both more general than but otherwise closely related to concussion in stressing the giving off of considerable energy, as in collision or blow. <I><FONT color=brown>Jolt</FONT></I> may suggest a sudden shaking motion imparted to one body by another that is in motion: thrown back in his seat with a <I><FONT color=brown>jolt</FONT></I> by the sudden slamming on of his brakes. It is widely used in a more general context for any surprising or stunning occurrence: scientific discoveries that came like <I><FONT color=brown>jolts</FONT></I> to awaken the scholastic mind of the era. <I><FONT color=brown>Shock</FONT></I> suggests an abrupt and heavy impact or onslaught: reeling back under the first <I><FONT color=brown>shock</FONT></I> of the attack. But the word’s other meanings are inevitably present as overtones here, implying a numbed unbelieving response or physical collapse from injury: the <I><FONT color=brown>shock</FONT></I> with which she took the tragic news; a blow that sent him into a state of <I><FONT color=brown>shock</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brunt</FONT></B> suggests an energetic bearing down that may or may not be supportable; once this may have referred particularly to abruptness of contact, much like <I><FONT color=brown>impact</FONT></I>: wiring that could not bear the <B><FONT color=blue>brunt</FONT></B> of any heavy flow of voltage. Now, more often, it refers to a steady demand that taxes endurance: the <I><FONT color=brown>brunt</FONT></I> of so many debts and so little earning power. <B><FONT color=blue>Force</FONT></B> is the most general of these words and may refer to the degree of energy with which objects make contact or to the amount of propulsion with which things move: grenades with enough <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I> to blow up a well-constructed enemy bunker; applying enough <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I> to dislodge the boulder; gamma rays that strike the earth’s atmosphere with considerable <I><FONT color=brown>force</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: BREAK (n.), BREAK (v.), <A href="entry://Impel">IMPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Propel">PROPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Wound">WOUND</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a lack of emotional responsiveness. <B><FONT color=blue>Impassive</FONT></B> can pertain to a total lack of sensation or feeling: the <I><FONT color=brown>impassive</FONT></I> eyes of the corpse. Used in a less extreme way, it can refer to someone who remains unmoved by an emotional appeal: The judge stared down, remote and <I><FONT color=brown>impassive</FONT></I>, while the defence counsel pleaded for clemency. With greater suggestiveness, the word can often indicate someone who maintains a calm or unmoved exterior to conceal an emotional response: Only the faintest flicker of distaste betrayed the otherwise <I><FONT color=brown>impassive</FONT></I> expression with which she greeted the visiting head of state.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Apathetic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>indifferent</FONT></B> contrast sharply with this last possibility for <I><FONT color=brown>impassive</FONT></I>, since both point to a failure to respond. In addition, <I><FONT color=brown>apathetic</FONT></I> often carries a tone of criticism for a deplorable or pitiable lack of awareness, compassion or empathy: students critical of parents who had grown <I><FONT color=brown>apathetic</FONT></I> about glaring social evils. Sometimes, this note of criticism may be absent: slum children already sunk in <I><FONT color=brown>apathetic</FONT></I> despair. Where <I><FONT color=brown>apathetic</FONT></I> can suggest an extreme state of contumacy or listlessness, <I><FONT color=brown>indifferent</FONT></I> usually indicates a milder state of boredom or uninvolvement. Also, where apathetic can sometimes suggest someone dulled by adversity, <I><FONT color=brown>indifferent</FONT></I> can point to self-contentment as the motivating factor: The French ruling class had long been <I><FONT color=brown>indifferent</FONT></I> to the miseries endured by the peasants. But <I><FONT color=brown>indifferent</FONT></I> is less often condemnatory than <I><FONT color=brown>apathetic</FONT></I>; it can be neutral or even positive: people wise enough to remain <I><FONT color=brown>indifferent</FONT></I> to the exhortations of demagogues ?without ever growing <I><FONT color=brown>apathetic</FONT></I> to the threat they represented.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Insensible</FONT></B> refers to a lack of sensation or awareness that stems either from a physiological numbness, from a steeled and determined stoicism, or from extreme preoccupation: fingers that had grown stiff and <I><FONT color=brown>insensible</FONT></I> with the cold; Indian braves who were taught to be <I><FONT color=brown>insensible</FONT></I> to the passage of time. Less approvingly, the word can refer to a callous lack of consideration for others: <I><FONT color=brown>insensible</FONT></I> to the needs of his wife.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Phlegmatic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stolid</FONT></B> most often refer to a whole cast of temperament that is unemotional. <I><FONT color=brown>Phlegmatic</FONT></I> suggests a habitually apathetic or wishy-washy personality, lacking in forcefulness or vividness a <I><FONT color=brown>phlegmatic</FONT></I> dullard who was as flat as stale beer. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>stolid</FONT></I> suggests someone wooden, stiff and unbending: a coarse, <I><FONT color=brown>stolid</FONT></I> gaoler who could watch executions without flinching. Whereas flinching. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>phlegmatic</FONT></I> can indicate someone weak, passive and yielding, even to the point of suggesting physical debilitation, stolid suggests a sturdy or unyielding rigidity of strength that is capable of surviving challenge: <I><FONT color=brown>phlegmatic</FONT></I> intellectuals who were no match for the <I><FONT color=brown>stolid</FONT></I> mass of the dictator’s adherents.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Disinterested">DISINTERESTED</A>, <A href="entry://Listless">LISTLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Oblivious">OBLIVIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Uninvolved">UNINVOLVED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Humane">HUMANE</A>, responsive.</P>

<P>These words refer to whatever causes or contributes to the starting or continuing of an action. <B><FONT color=blue>Impel</FONT></B> always suggests considerable force; sometimes this can apply to the movement of physical objects: an upward rush of sparks, <I><FONT color=brown>impelled</FONT></I> by columns of smoke that erupted from the burning buildings. More often, the word refers to people acting under strong outward constraint or inner necessity: refugees <I><FONT color=brown>impelled</FONT></I> to flee before the advancing armies; legislators <I><FONT color=brown>impelled</FONT></I> by popular opinion to campaign for the passage of a bill; <I><FONT color=brown>impelled</FONT></I> by his desire to see her once more. <B><FONT color=blue>Move</FONT></B> is much more general; it can refer to physical motion without reference to force: the earth moves round the sun. when applied to the behaviour of people, it stresses one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>impel</FONT></I>, namely, a forceful inner conviction or depth of feeling: <I><FONT color=brown>moved</FONT></I> by her appeal to enter the fight in her behalf. Just as often, the word refers to any surge of emotion: <I><FONT color=brown>moved</FONT></I> to tears; a film that he had found very <I><FONT color=brown>moving</FONT></I>.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>impel</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>driven</FONT></B> can suggest considerable force in reference to physical objects: leaves <I><FONT color=brown>driven</FONT></I> by the wind. It contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>impel</FONT></I> because of its greater informality. In reference to what causes people to act, it can suggest a more direct outward goading than <I><FONT color=brown>impel</FONT></I>, or a greater inner obsessiveness than move: Christ <I><FONT color=brown>driving</FONT></I> the money changes from the temple; <I><FONT color=brown>driving</FONT></I> off the flies with a fly-swatter; a psychosis that <I><FONT color=brown>drove</FONT></I> him to act out his fantasies in reality; <I><FONT color=brown>driven</FONT></I> to drink by a nagging wife. <B><FONT color=blue>Motivate</FONT></B> is mostly restricted to expressing what causes people to act. It can be used in neutral causal explanation; What <I><FONT color=brown>motivated</FONT></I> him to commit the murder? Or it can indicate a conscious attempt to inculcate a desire for something: students <I><FONT color=brown>motivated</FONT></I> to learn by the encouragement of a good teacher.</P><P>Where all the previous words are as equally applicable to initial as to continuing action, <B><FONT color=blue>prod</FONT></B> and prompt both emphasize setting something into motion. At its most literal, <I><FONT color=brown>prod</FONT></I> suggests the use of some sort of tool: He <I><FONT color=brown>prodded</FONT></I> the anthill with a stick. When applied to human behaviour, the word suggests an isolated impetus of any sort: a smell of smoke that <I><FONT color=brown>prodded</FONT></I> the sleeping parents into action; a book that <I><FONT color=brown>prodded</FONT></I> the nation into a belated concern for the impoverished. <B><FONT color=blue>Prompt</FONT></B> literally refers to giving a speaker a cue to his lines, as in the theatre. He still had to be <I><FONT color=brown>prompted</FONT></I> after two weeks of rehearsing; a television <I><FONT color=brown>prompting</FONT></I> device for speakers delivering written speeches. In more general uses, the word is like prod in suggesting any sort of stimulus to action. But where <I><FONT color=brown>prod</FONT></I> often suggests a start or jolt that makes one newly aware of something, <I><FONT color=brown>prompt</FONT></I> is more like motivate, though less formal, in its emphasis on causation: a misstatement of fact that <I><FONT color=brown>prompted</FONT></I> him to disagree with his host for the first time that evening; What <I><FONT color=brown>prompted</FONT></I> him to behave so rudely to his guests?</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compel">COMPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Incite">INCITE</A>, <A href="entry://Induce">INDUCE</A>, <A href="entry://Propel">PROPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Stimulate">STIMULATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: inhibit, <A href="entry://Prevent">PREVENT</A>, <A href="entry://Quell">QUELL</A>, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A> (arrest), <A href="entry://Subdue">SUBDUE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>impenetrable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>impassable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>impermeable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>impervious</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the resistance of a thing to incursions upon or into it. <B><FONT color=blue>Impenetrable</FONT></B> suggests a solid mass of resistance that cannot be pierced or breached: miners trapped in the tunnel by an <I><FONT color=brown>impenetrable</FONT></I> mass of debris; rush-hour traffic that is almost <I><FONT color=brown>impenetrable</FONT></I> to the poor pedestrian; an <I><FONT color=brown>impenetrable</FONT></I> phalanx of screaming women clustered round the bargain table. The suggestion of an unbroken mass, however, need not always be present; in this case the word may simply suggest the considerable resistance presented to anyone attempting to move through the medium: an <I><FONT color=brown>impenetrable</FONT></I> clump of blackberries. The word may even be applied to things that permit incursions but thwart their purpose: a jungle that was <I><FONT color=brown>impenetrable</FONT></I> to a whole generation of explorers, all of whom it swallowed up with effortless ease. Used of people, their expressions or personality, the word suggests inscrutability, lack of response, or hostility: She responded to his proposal with an <I><FONT color=brown>impenetrable</FONT></I> blankness. The failure to pierce an <I><FONT color=brown>impenetrable</FONT></I> object might still leave marks or superficial signs of damage. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>impervious</FONT></B> suggests something that is literally beyond showing any change whatsoever from attempts to breach or affect it: gems that are <I><FONT color=brown>impervious</FONT></I> to scratching or to wear; metals <I><FONT color=brown>impervious</FONT></I> to cold and heat. As can be seen, this word does not necessarily imply warding off efforts at piercing something so much as surviving harsh vicissitudes without change. This is even more true in the word’s less concrete uses, suggesting inscrutability or hostility less than inner strength, stubbornness or determination that cannot be swayed by externals: They led a life <I><FONT color=brown>impervious</FONT></I> to criticism; infuriatingly <I><FONT color=brown>impervious</FONT></I> to her every suggestion; <I><FONT color=brown>impervious</FONT></I> to the temptations offered him if only he would compromise his position.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Impassable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>impermeable</FONT></B> are both more narrowly restricted to specific contexts of resistance than the foregoing. <I><FONT color=brown>Impassable</FONT></I> refers to any blockage that makes travel impossible: roads that became <I><FONT color=brown>impassable</FONT></I> during the rainy season; heavy snows and avalanches that rendered the mountain route <I><FONT color=brown>impassable</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Impermeable</FONT></B> refers, even more specifically, to a membrane through which certain fluids cannot pass. The membrane itself, of course, is not the same sort of barrier to passage as those implied by these other words, since it might well be easily ruptured; also, the membrane may be selective in the substances to which it prohibits passage: tissues <I><FONT color=brown>impermeable</FONT></I> to carbon dioxide but not to oxygen.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compact">COMPACT</A>, <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, <A href="entry://Obstacle">OBSTACLE</A>, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A> (arrest).</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: accessible, open, permeable, <A href="entry://Vulnerable">VULNERABLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to the absence of visible tension or excitement in persons when such reactions might well be expected by the circumstances. <B><FONT color=blue>Imperturbable</FONT></B> carries the sense of self-control based on temperament or discipline; it is perhaps most often used of a diplomatic or stately detachment and suggests more of a constitutional inability than a conscious refusal to panic: The <I><FONT color=brown>imperturbable</FONT></I> Treasurer responded without asperity to the severe, pointed questioning of the Parliamentary committee members. When applied to attitudes or conduct rather than people, <I><FONT color=brown>imperturbable</FONT></I> means unshakable, and suggests a strong, almost irrational devotion to a particular point of view: an <I><FONT color=brown>imperturbable</FONT></I> optimism that was not to be dampened by misfortune, however great.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cool</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dispassionate</FONT></B> suggest a deliberate stifling of emotions in the face of disturbing influences.

<P>These words are applied to actions or persons characterized by a lack of forethought, warning or preparation. <B><FONT color=blue>Impetuous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>impulsive</FONT></B> differ from the other words in applying to both people and actions. <I><FONT color=brown>Impetuous</FONT></I> suggests more decisive or vigorous action than <I><FONT color=brown>impulsive</FONT></I>, and often implies an unfortunate outcome as a result. <I><FONT color=brown>Impulsive</FONT></I> means acting on impulse, and since impulses can be good as well as bad, impulsiveness is not necessarily deplorable; it may even be considered endearing or attractive. <I><FONT color=brown>Impetuosity</FONT></I>, on the other hand, implies a rather childish inability to be patient or thoughtful before taking action. [Hers was a generous, <I><FONT color=brown>impulsive</FONT></I> nature, capable of showing spontaneous affection and warmth; an <I><FONT color=brown>impetuous</FONT></I> decision that he later learned to regret; to stamp his foot in an <I><FONT color=brown>impetuous</FONT></I> rage.] <I><FONT color=brown>Impulsive</FONT></I> need not always imply recklessness, and in some contexts may only imply spontaneity and the lack of premeditation: an <I><FONT color=brown>impulsive</FONT></I> urge to re-open the door and check to see if all the windows were closed before she left for the weekend.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Headlong</FONT></B> suggests a reckless disregard of consequences coupled with <I><FONT color=brown>impetuous</FONT></I> haste. Unlike the other words here considered, <I><FONT color=brown>headlong</FONT></I> is used as both an adjective and an adverb; it is somewhat more formal when used as an adjective: a <I><FONT color=brown>headlong</FONT></I> advance into enemy territory; women rushing <I><FONT color=brown>headlong</FONT></I> into the store at the start of the sale; to plunge <I><FONT color=brown>headlong</FONT></I> into a new business without adequate financial backing.

[The editorial called the union’s rejection of management’s wage offer <I><FONT color=brown>precipitate</FONT></I> and unwarranted.] <B><FONT color=blue>Sudden</FONT></B>, as here considered, suggests an abrupt or unexpected action but does not necessarily imply haste; it does point to either a spontaneous, unpremeditated act or a perception for which one is not prepared.

More generally, however, the word refers to the fixing of an idea in the mind, usually in the context of the educating of a child or student by a parent or teacher: a sense of decency <I><FONT color=brown>implanted</FONT></I> in him by his upbringing. In this use, the establishing of rudimentary principles or attitudes is usually suggested, but rote training is not necessarily the technique by which the <I><FONT color=brown>implanting</FONT></I> is done. In any case, a deeply rooted and unshakable transfer of attitude or knowledge is implied. Such a fixing of ideas in one’s own mind is not usually suggested by the word, but an unconscious process may be indicated, or even the fixing of qualities by heredity rather than environment: an innate curiosity that seems to have been <I><FONT color=brown>implanted</FONT></I> in him from birth. The word can also, at its most general, suggest the informing or propagandizing of any audience, whether overtly or subliminally: assumptions about co-operation and competition that each culture <I><FONT color=brown>implants</FONT></I> in its members.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inseminate</FONT></B> can still reflect its derivation by referring literally to the sowing of seed in soil. Much more commonly, however, the word refers to the introducing of semen into the vagina or, more rarely, to the <I><FONT color=brown>implanting</FONT></I> of ideas in the mind: studying the reproductive cycle from the <I><FONT color=brown>inseminating</FONT></I> of sperm to the birth of the child; means for artificially <I><FONT color=brown>inseminating</FONT></I> livestock; teachers who <I><FONT color=brown>inseminate</FONT></I> a respect for authority in their students.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Infuse</FONT></B>, in its original Latin form, meant to pour in. it now carries a suggestion of that pouring in in its reference to the introduction of something, as a quality, feeling or idea into a receiving medium. Such introduction, it is implied, lends the medium inspiration, animation or new significance: to <I><FONT color=brown>infuse</FONT></I> life into a dull party. <B><FONT color=blue>Imbue</FONT></B> has much the same connotation as <I><FONT color=brown>infuse</FONT></I>, but, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>infuse</FONT></I> may indicate a temporary or superficial influence, <I><FONT color=brown>imbue</FONT></I> more often points to a change that deeply affects the receiving medium. Another difference between the two words is the fact that <I><FONT color=brown>imbue</FONT></I> takes for its object the thing affected rather than the thing introduced: to <I><FONT color=brown>imbue</FONT></I> a man with confidence.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ingrain</FONT></B> means to impress firmly on the mind or character. The word, which is used almost exclusively in the passive or past participle, is like imbue in denoting an affecting influence that works into the inmost texture or grain of the receiving medium: a deep respect for the truth had been <I><FONT color=brown>ingrained</FONT></I> in the child.</P><P>The remaining pair are restricted solely to the context of learning. <B><FONT color=blue>Instil</FONT></B> suggests a slow, subtle, possibly gentle transfer of attitude more than facts, one that reflects its derivation from a word meaning to put in by drops. Most often <I><FONT color=brown>instil</FONT></I> suggests a conscious imparting to someone who is, at most, only partially aware of the process: striving to <I><FONT color=brown>instil</FONT></I> in her son a hatred for his father; understanding how carefully his psychiatrist worked to <I><FONT color=brown>instil</FONT></I> in him an attitude of perfect trust; seeing how blindly everything in his drab environment had worked to <I><FONT color=brown>instil</FONT></I> within him a rage against the established order; nations that, without even realizing it, <I><FONT color=brown>instil</FONT></I> in their citizens an unexamined fear of outsiders. <I><FONT color=brown>Instil</FONT></I> is the only one of these words, furthermore, that can possibly suggest the development of an attitude within oneself: a historian who has not <I><FONT color=brown>instilled</FONT></I> in himself a proper objectivity towards the period he is treating.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inculcate</FONT></B> limits this range of possibilities in instil to one situation, that in which both teacher and student are well aware of the learning process under way; a further limiting exists in that the word refers specifically to an ingraining of facts, ideas or attitudes by the technique of laborious repetition: a generation of students that had not been <I><FONT color=brown>inculcated</FONT></I> with the rules of grammar. [English spelling cannot be reasoned out; it must be <I><FONT color=brown>inculcated</FONT></I>, example by insufferable example.] The word more recently ahs taken on a disapproving tone to refer to the deliberate ingraining of propaganda or flagrant falsehoods in unsuspecting subjects: <I><FONT color=brown>inculcating</FONT></I> the doctrines of race hatred in innocent children.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Insert">INSERT</A>, <A href="entry://Teach">TEACH</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things left unexpressed, unrealized or unacted upon, though their existence or influence can often be detected. <B><FONT color=blue>Implicit</FONT></B> refers to something that is not revealed in words or action but that can be inferred from the evidence: an <I><FONT color=brown>implicit</FONT></I> cultural assumption that men are superior to women; the breakdown of moral standards <I><FONT color=brown>implicit</FONT></I> in today’s emphasis on sex in dress, literature and entertainment; a weakness <I><FONT color=brown>implicit</FONT></I> in his whole approach to Renaissance art. <B><FONT color=blue>Potential</FONT></B> is close to implicit, but stresses the capability of something to become active: on the look-out for <I><FONT color=brown>potential</FONT></I> customers; the good and evil <I><FONT color=brown>potential</FONT></I> within each person. <B><FONT color=blue>Latent</FONT></B>, by contrast, stresses something that is not conscious or acted out, with no implication that it need ever be made manifest: a <I><FONT color=brown>latent</FONT></I> pyromaniac; musical talent that remained <I><FONT color=brown>latent</FONT></I> through a lack of training. Occasionally the word can suggest something once in evidence but now hidden through accident or design: childhood fears that have become latent and fossilized in adulthood.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Covert</FONT></B> is restricted to this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>latent</FONT></I>, referring to something that is deliberately hidden or brought about in secret. Thus, the word may even suggest a furtive acting out of something, a possibility that is in sharp contrast to those for the previous words: <I><FONT color=brown>covert</FONT></I> assignations that brought them together often, though both remained tied to their respective spouses. The stealth implied in the word usually points to unsavoury or unethical misconduct, although this is not always true: hermetic readings of scripture that saw it as a system of <I><FONT color=brown>covert</FONT></I> symbols for Gnostic doctrines; auctions conducted by means of <I><FONT color=brown>covert</FONT></I> signals between the bidders and the auctioneer. <B><FONT color=blue>Tacit</FONT></B> may apply in the same general way as <I><FONT color=brown>implicit</FONT></I>, but it does have specific relevance to agreements or understandings arrived at without verbalizing some or all of the conditions involved; a <I><FONT color=brown>tacit</FONT></I> feeling in the group that the newcomer should be watched closely; club rules that left <I><FONT color=brown>tacit</FONT></I> the exclusion of certain classes of prospective members. <B><FONT color=blue>Unspoken</FONT></B> is restricted to one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>tacit</FONT></I>, referring more informally to things not mentioned or said aloud. Like <I><FONT color=brown>covert</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>tacit</FONT></I>, the word contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>latent</FONT></I> in indicating things one is conscious of and acts upon, but without expressing them: eyes glinting with her evident but <I><FONT color=brown>unspoken</FONT></I> disapproval of him; conjugal assumptions that were left <I><FONT color=brown>unspoken</FONT></I> out of a sense of delicacy.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Inherent">INHERENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: actual, <A href="entry://Definite">DEFINITE</A>, exposed, overt, plain.</P>

<P>These words mean to bring something to a higher level of quality, efficiency, etc. <B><FONT color=blue>Improve</FONT></B> is the most general word in this group; it can mean to increase, enlarge, correct or raise, as in the following examples: to <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I> one’s vocabulary; to <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I> one’s understanding of world affairs; to <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I> one’s habits; to <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I> one’s marks in school. <I><FONT color=brown>Improve</FONT></I> thus refers to any means of making something higher in quality or more desirable nature.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Better</FONT></B>, more colloquial in tone, is in some contexts interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>better</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I>) one’s marks. But as a rule it has more narrow implication, often suggesting only a modest increase or elevation in knowledge or appreciation. Although <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I> can also be used to describe such situations, in contexts implying a profound or important elevation of status or quality, <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I> is more likely to be used: Through keen management procedures and a substantial investment the company’s market potential was vastly <I><FONT color=brown>improved</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Better</FONT></I> is often used reflexively with the sense of improving socially or economically. [He took the new job to <I><FONT color=brown>better</FONT></I> himself; He cultivated socialites in the hope of <I><FONT color=brown>bettering</FONT></I> himself.] <I><FONT color=brown>Better</FONT></I> so used often has a distinctly vulgar tone. The greater scope and importance that attaches to <I><FONT color=brown>improve</FONT></I> is immediately evident if one contrasts <I><FONT color=brown>to improve oneself</FONT></I> with <I><FONT color=brown>to better oneself</FONT></I>: He went to night school to <I><FONT color=brown>improve himself</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ameliorate</FONT></B> is usually applied to conditions rather than to specific things, and suggests that the conditions are much in need of correction: The city council considered framing new ordinances to <I><FONT color=brown>ameliorate</FONT></I> the unsanitary conditions and slum areas. <B><FONT color=blue>Meliorate</FONT></B> has the same meaning as <I><FONT color=brown>ameliorate</FONT></I>, but is nowadays less often used.

<P>The words in this list all mean to stimulate vigorously into being or action. <B><FONT color=blue>Incite</FONT></B> means to spur to action, and may be applied to measures leading to salutary as well as deplorable results, to minor as well as profound changes: to <I><FONT color=brown>incite</FONT></I> others to greater effort by setting an example with one’s own conduct; to <I><FONT color=brown>incite</FONT></I> a riot by making inflammatory speeches. <B><FONT color=blue>Stir up</FONT></B> is more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>incite</FONT></I> and more often applies to less serious disturbances or to attitudes of mind: an unruly boy who kept <I><FONT color=brown>stirring up</FONT></I> trouble when the teacher’s back was turned; to <I><FONT color=brown>stir up</FONT></I> indignation. When applied to mental attitudes, as in the latter example, <I><FONT color=brown>stir up</FONT></I> is close to <B><FONT color=blue>arouse</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Arouse</FONT></I> points specifically to awakening or opening one’s eyes to a certain situation or point of view, whereas the more emphatic rouse indicates a call to action or to vigorous opinion that is likely to lead to action. [His speech <I><FONT color=brown>roused</FONT></I> the audience to such a pitch of fury that the police were forced to escort him away hastily for his own safety; The exhibition of poor sportsmanship <I><FONT color=brown>aroused</FONT></I> a sense of disgust and humiliation in all who witnessed it.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Instigate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>foment</FONT></B> usually suggest the setting in motion of events that in some way threaten or upset the status quo. They will therefore convey a negative or unfavourable connotation to the extent that one deplores violent change. <I><FONT color=brown>Instigate</FONT></I> suggests an insidious design to bring about some drastic action: to <I><FONT color=brown>instigate</FONT></I> an assassination; to <I><FONT color=brown>instigate</FONT></I> a plot to seize control of a government. <I><FONT color=brown>Foment</FONT></I>, which is derived from a Latin verb meaning to keep warm, suggests a deliberate attempt to keep people or conditions agitated in order to bring about radical change, or simply to promote dissension and discord: to <I><FONT color=brown>foment</FONT></I> rebellion; to <I><FONT color=brown>foment</FONT></I> mutiny. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>instigate</FONT></I> emphasizes the act of initiating the design, <I><FONT color=brown>foment</FONT></I> stresses keeping it alive ?fanning the fire, so to speak. <I><FONT color=brown>Instigate</FONT></I>, in addition, does have a wider range of use and can point to any design, even one of noble motive, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>foment</FONT></I> is used most often of underhanded designs aiming at radical change: to <I><FONT color=brown>instigate</FONT></I> a change in the appointments system with the object of increasing the efficiency of the administration; to <I><FONT color=brown>foment</FONT></I> fear and discord.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Provoke</FONT></B>, as here considered, can be used, like <I><FONT color=brown>instigate</FONT></I>, to point to a variety of results, but it does not necessarily or even commonly imply conscious design. It may on the contrary imply spontaneous reaction: The slur <I><FONT color=brown>provoked</FONT></I> a sharp retort. Like <I><FONT color=brown>arouse</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>stir up</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>provoke</FONT></I> may also be used of the stimulation of a particular mental attitude: The arbitrary police action <I><FONT color=brown>provoked</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>aroused</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>stirred up</FONT></I>) a public outcry for an investigation. <I><FONT color=brown>Provoke</FONT></I> emphasizes more strongly than the other words of this group a direct and immediate cause-and-effect connection between the stimulus and response ?the act that <I><FONT color=brown>incites</FONT></I> and the result: The outbreak of war <I><FONT color=brown>provoked</FONT></I> a call for meeting of the U.N. Security Council.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Exhort</FONT></B> means to urge earnestly; it suggests an attempt to persuade someone to take a course or action by emphatic and even passionate argument or by appealing to his sympathy or conscience: The backbencher <I><FONT color=brown>exhorted</FONT></I> his colleagues to vote against the motion to censure him for his prolonged absences from the House. <I><FONT color=brown>Exhort</FONT></I> often implies a degree of desperation, and can be close in meaning to beg or plead with, only more formal in tone: <I><FONT color=brown>exhorting</FONT></I> his fellow students not to expose his cheating in the examination.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Induce">INDUCE</A>, <A href="entry://Stimulate">STIMULATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Discourage">DISCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, <A href="entry://Subdue">SUBDUE</A>.</P>

include
<B><FONT color=blue>include</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>comprise</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>contain</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>involve</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to an entity that takes in two or more parts or elements. <B><FONT color=blue>Include</FONT></B>, the most general of these, can indicate clearly defined subdivisions within a whole: The businessmen’s club <I><FONT color=brown>includes</FONT></I> a gym, swimming pool, sauna and locker room. It can pertain equally well to contents that are more imponderable or less tangible: a discussion that <I><FONT color=brown>included</FONT></I> extended treatment of the two world wars, the Korean action, and the Vietnam War. The word can be useful, since it need not suggest an exhaustive listing of parts or elements: Our ten-city tour <I><FONT color=brown>included</FONT></I> a visit to Stratford. Often, the word points to an additional feature, a secondary element or a side benefit: The second book was more useful because it <I><FONT color=brown>included</FONT></I> a detailed chronological table of the events under discussion. <B><FONT color=blue>Comprise</FONT></B> is a considerably more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>include</FONT></I>, except that it most often indicates a complete or exhaustive breakdown of an entity into its parts or elements: The anthology <I><FONT color=brown>comprises</FONT></I> samples from the work of ten authors.</P><P>Most concretely, <B><FONT color=blue>contain</FONT></B> can indicate discrete things held or enclosed by a larger object: The bowl <I><FONT color=brown>contained</FONT></I> a variety of fruit. The word functions much like <I><FONT color=brown>include</FONT></I> in indicating the parts or element making up a whole. <I><FONT color=brown>Contain</FONT></I>, however, can function only when some sense of enclosure within the whole exists. One would not, for example, speak of a tour <I><FONT color=brown>containing</FONT></I> visits to various cities. Otherwise, the word compares with <I><FONT color=brown>include</FONT></I> and contrasts with comprise in not being restricted to an exhaustive listing. [The book <I><FONT color=brown>contained</FONT></I> reproductions of paintings by Cézanne, Monet and Matisse; Does your school building <I><FONT color=brown>contain</FONT></I> an assembly hall?] Where both <I><FONT color=brown>include</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>contain</FONT></I> can point to concrete or material entities and their parts, <B><FONT color=blue>involve</FONT></B> almost exclusively concentrate on less tangible things and their elements: an argument that <I><FONT color=brown>involved</FONT></I> a discussion of basic principles. In this it compares with <I><FONT color=brown>comprise</FONT></I>; by contrast, however, <I><FONT color=brown>involve</FONT></I> need not suggest an exhaustive listing: Aside from its most widely known features, his philosophical system also <I><FONT color=brown>involved</FONT></I> a belief in reincarnation.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Circumscribe">CIRCUMSCRIBE</A>, <A href="entry://Possess">POSSESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: exclude, leave out, omit.</P>

<P>These words refer to things that change frequently or rapidly, or to unstable or disloyal natures. <B><FONT color=blue>Inconstant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>fickle</FONT></B> are formal and informal terms, respectively, for unfaithfulness, usually in love. <I><FONT color=brown>Inconstant</FONT></I>, however, can apply to a single betrayal of love, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>fickle</FONT></I> applies to the habit of moving from one light or trivial infatuation to another: a fiancé who proved to be <I><FONT color=brown>inconstant</FONT></I>: career-girl hoydens who are <I><FONT color=brown>fickle</FONT></I> and promiscuous. <I><FONT color=brown>Inconstant</FONT></I> can sometimes refer more widely to anything showing variability: desert oases whose wells give an inconstant supply of fresh water; a politician who had been <I><FONT color=brown>inconstant</FONT></I> in his devotion to the principles of his party. In wider uses, <I><FONT color=brown>fickle</FONT></I> still applies to the basic situation of loyalty: young idealists who often prove to be <I><FONT color=brown>fickle</FONT></I> in their choice of causes to uphold.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Changeable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>erratic</FONT></B> are much more general than the previous pair and are less disapproving in tone. <I><FONT color=brown>Changeable</FONT></I> can register the neutral fact that something is capable of change: the <I><FONT color=brown>changeable</FONT></I> patterns of watered silk. Indeed, this capacity can be desirable: a camera with <I><FONT color=brown>changeable</FONT></I> shutter speeds. More often, however, the word carries a negative tone in reference to people who habitually and readily take up and discard attitudes or opinions: a <I><FONT color=brown>changeable</FONT></I> sort of person who favoured the war one day and opposed it the next. <I><FONT color=brown>Erratic</FONT></I> points more to an uneven or arbitrary course: the <I><FONT color=brown>erratic</FONT></I> path of the rivulet; an <I><FONT color=brown>erratic</FONT></I> fellow whose actions were usually completely unpredictable.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chameleonic</FONT></B> is most comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>changeable</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>capricious</FONT></B> to <I><FONT color=brown>erratic</FONT></I>, but both words are alike in being more vivid than the foregoing and in being more exclusively concentrated on human characteristics. <I><FONT color=brown>Chameleonic</FONT></I> refers to the chameleon’s ability, as a defensive camouflage, of changing colour so as to blend with its background. Sometimes the word applies to human versatility in a neutral or approving way: students who are <I><FONT color=brown>chameleonic</FONT></I> in the diversity of their extracurricular activities; <I><FONT color=brown>chameleonic</FONT></I> in the way he could make himself at home among all sorts of people. More often the word suggests an insincere person willing to play and role that might be of momentary advantage to him: a <I><FONT color=brown>chameleonic</FONT></I> candidate who took pro-labour stands before union audiences and pro-business stands at chamber-of-commerce dinners. <I><FONT color=brown>Capricious</FONT></I>, which is exclusively negative in tone, need not suggest insincerity, like <I><FONT color=brown>chameleonic</FONT></I>, but it does stress an arbitrary and high-handed attitude in which unfair choices are made, not on the merits of a case, but on the basis of personal taste or whim: a drama critic who seemed <I><FONT color=brown>capricious</FONT></I> in the way be bestowed praise or blame; a woman who was haughty and <I><FONT color=brown>capricious</FONT></I> towards her servants.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mercurial</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>protean</FONT></B>, alone of these words, may suggest rapidity as well as frequency of change. <I><FONT color=brown>Mercurial</FONT></I> is most comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>chameleonic</FONT></I>, but where a negative tone preponderates in the latter’s use, <I><FONT color=brown>mercurial</FONT></I> is more dependent on context to establish approval or disapproval. In favourable reference, it suggests a highly charged and energetic mental dexterity that is flexible to the demands of specific situations and responsive to opportunities for exploiting such situations to best advantage: a <I><FONT color=brown>mercurial</FONT></I> artist who completely transformed the artistic possibilities of ever medium he worked in. in negative uses, the word suggests an excessively volatile quickness and impatience that results in poor control and botched efforts: too <I><FONT color=brown>mercurial</FONT></I> to sit down and do the painstaking work of revision that his brilliant first drafts sorely needed. <I><FONT color=brown>Protean</FONT></I> refers to the ability of the demi-god <I><FONT color=brown>Proteus</FONT></I> to change shapes as a way of eluding capture; often, <I><FONT color=brown>protean</FONT></I> can function identically with chameleonic in both positive and negative ways. Most often, however, the word refers favourably to someone gifted with diverse abilities and skills which are exhibited in a remarkable proliferation of accomplishments: Michelangelo’s <I><FONT color=brown>protean</FONT></I> imagination. Sometimes, the word refers more neutrally to anything given to change: a period of crisis in which the same basic dilemma appeared again and again in <I><FONT color=brown>protean</FONT></I> forms.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adaptable">ADAPTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Hesitate">HESITATE</A>, <A href="entry://Temporary">TEMPORARY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Everlasting">EVERLASTING</A>, faithful, <A href="entry://Immutable">IMMUTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Invariable">INVARIABLE</A>, loyal, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>indecent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>immodest</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>improper</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>indecorous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>indelicate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unseemly</FONT></B>:

<P>These words mean not conforming to accepted standards of social behaviour, good taste or propriety. <B><FONT color=blue>Indecent</FONT></B> is the strongest word in this group. Primarily it connotes condemnation of obscenity or licentiousness: <I><FONT color=brown>indecent</FONT></I> remarks directed at passing school girls; <I><FONT color=brown>indecent</FONT></I> pictures; an <I><FONT color=brown>indecent</FONT></I> proposal to engage in abnormal sexual practices. In its second meaning, <I><FONT color=brown>indecent</FONT></I> suggests a lack of decorum and disregard for the feelings of others. [After his wife died, he remarried with <I><FONT color=brown>indecent</FONT></I> haste; His appetite for gossip a absolutely <I><FONT color=brown>indecent</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Immodest</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>indelicate</FONT></B> are applied to that which shows little sense of what is fitting or acceptable in a society which sets a high price on propriety. In one sense, <I><FONT color=brown>immodest</FONT></I> is close in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>indecent</FONT></I>, having long been applied, especially to women, when it is a question of revealing clothing or unrestrained behaviour towards the opposite sex. [Many older people find the bikini <I><FONT color=brown>immodest</FONT></I>; My mother thinks my sister is <I><FONT color=brown>immodest</FONT></I> because she pursues boys.] <I><FONT color=brown>Immodest</FONT></I> has a second meaning of aggressive and boastful: the <I><FONT color=brown>immodest</FONT></I> self-seeking of a social climber; to brag in an <I><FONT color=brown>immodest</FONT></I> way about one’s great abilities. <I><FONT color=brown>Indelicate</FONT></I> is not as strong a term as <I><FONT color=brown>immodest</FONT></I> and suggests more a lack of tact and thoughtfulness than unconventional behaviour. [It is thought by many to be <I><FONT color=brown>indelicate</FONT></I> to discuss how much money one makes; Subjects fit for the club bar are sometimes too <I><FONT color=brown>indelicate</FONT></I> to be discussed at the family dinner table.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Improper</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unseemly</FONT></B> are used of actions or conduct that violate standards of good taste and the fitness of things. [It is considered <I><FONT color=brown>improper</FONT></I> for a lawyer to discuss his clients outside his office; It would be regarded as <I><FONT color=brown>unseemly</FONT></I> and ridiculous for a well-known philosopher to endorse the qualities of a patent medicine.] Often <I><FONT color=brown>improper</FONT></I> is used as a euphemism for <I><FONT color=brown>indecent</FONT></I> in the sense of obscene: to make <I><FONT color=brown>improper</FONT></I> advances.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indecorous</FONT></B> is applied to conduct that does not conform to established conventions of formality and manners, conduct generally consisting of minor infractions for which any of the other words in this group would be too strong. [Loud laughter during a wedding ceremony is <I><FONT color=brown>indecorous</FONT></I>; She always felt <I><FONT color=brown>indecorous</FONT></I> when she was obliged to adjust a slipped shoulder strap in public.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Depraved">DEPRAVED</A>, <A href="entry://Lewd">LEWD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chaste">CHASTE</A>, <A href="entry://Modest">MODEST</A>, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to make one’s will or views prevail over those of another in various ways. <B><FONT color=blue>Induce</FONT></B> means to get another to do something by appealing to his reason: to <I><FONT color=brown>induce</FONT></I> a man to stop drinking; to <I><FONT color=brown>induce</FONT></I> a teenage driver to obey the traffic laws.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Persuade</FONT></B> is the most general term and may be substituted for any of others. However, in its most specific sense, it means to attempt to produce a desired action by an appeal to the emotions or the will. [After he had been ill for a week, we finally <I><FONT color=brown>persuaded</FONT></I> him to consult a doctor; A newspaper article about the plight of the flood victims <I><FONT color=brown>persuaded</FONT></I> him to send a contribution to the Red Cross.]</P><P>In this context, <B><FONT color=blue>urge</FONT></B> is the strongest term and means to induce or persuade insistently, and vigorously, usually with the strong intention of accomplishing one’s goal: to <I><FONT color=brown>urge</FONT></I> student to work harder; to <I><FONT color=brown>urge</FONT></I> an overworked mother to take a holiday.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Coax</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cajole</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wheedle</FONT></B> all mean to <I><FONT color=brown>persuade</FONT></I> by using gentleness, tact and even artfulness. <I><FONT color=brown>Coax</FONT></I> implies the use of kindness and patience: to <I><FONT color=brown>coax</FONT></I> a sick child to eat by making a game of it; to <I><FONT color=brown>coax</FONT></I> a blind person to learn to cross busy streets. In an earlier sense, <I><FONT color=brown>cajole</FONT></I> meant to <I><FONT color=brown>coax</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>persuade</FONT></I> by false promises and excessive flattery, but it now suggests more the idea of being agreeable and winning in order to get a person to do something: My outgoing friends were able to <I><FONT color=brown>cajole</FONT></I> the shy newcomer into attending the party. <I><FONT color=brown>Wheedle</FONT></I> implies the use of blandishments and whiles to obtain what one wants: She always <I><FONT color=brown>wheedles</FONT></I> money out of her father by hugging him and telling him how generous he is.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impel">IMPEL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Discourage">DISCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, repel, <A href="entry://Subdue">SUBDUE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>inevitable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inescapable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>necessary</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unavoidable</FONT></B>:

<P>These words describe events or conditions that cannot be prevented from happening. <B><FONT color=blue>Inevitable</FONT></B>, the strongest term, describes something that is bound to happen or be met with in the very nature of things. [Pain is <I><FONT color=brown>inevitable</FONT></I> when one breaks a bone; By the time the helmsman realized his error, a collision was <I><FONT color=brown>inevitable</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inescapable</FONT></B> is often used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>inevitable</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>inescapable</FONT></I> suggests something which may not be completely unalterable given a different set of attitudes or circumstances. [Whereas death is <I><FONT color=brown>inevitable</FONT></I>, earning a living is <I><FONT color=brown>inescapable</FONT></I> unless one has private means or is forced to live at public expense; He felt that failure was an <I><FONT color=brown>inescapable</FONT></I> part of his lot in life.]</P><P>When used in this context, <B><FONT color=blue>necessary</FONT></B> has less impact than <I><FONT color=brown>inevitable</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>inescapable</FONT></I>. Something that is <I><FONT color=brown>necessary</FONT></I> must logically occur because of an existing set of factors. [Hunger and disease are <I><FONT color=brown>necessary</FONT></I> concomitants of war; Crowded streets and shops are a <I><FONT color=brown>necessary</FONT></I> part of big-city life.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unavoidable</FONT></B> is applied to events and conditions that are not always <I><FONT color=brown>inevitable</FONT></I>, but in specific instances are <I><FONT color=brown>incapable</FONT></I> of being shunned or evaded: Accidents on our highways may be <I><FONT color=brown>inevitable</FONT></I>, but a particular accident was <I><FONT color=brown>unavoidable</FONT></I> because of bad weather and heavy traffic.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compel">COMPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Conclusive">CONCLUSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Inexorable">INEXORABLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words describe persons or things that do not let up or swerve from their course out of any feeling of compassion. <B><FONT color=blue>Inexorable</FONT></B> is the most formal word. It may be used of unyielding, unappeasable persons: an <I><FONT color=brown>inexorable</FONT></I> foe; his <I><FONT color=brown>inexorable</FONT></I> will. But it is more often applied to inhuman or objective forces that cannot be avoided, stopped or changed: Oedipus could not escape his <I><FONT color=brown>inexorable</FONT></I> fate.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Remorseless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>relentless</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unrelenting</FONT></B> are closest in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>inexorable</FONT></I>. All imply a powerful, driving force and unceasing progress towards a goal: driving himself at a <I><FONT color=brown>relentless</FONT></I> pace; to apply <I><FONT color=brown>relentless</FONT></I> pressure; an <I><FONT color=brown>unrelenting</FONT></I> fight against crime. But <I><FONT color=brown>remorseless</FONT></I> is the most chilling word of the three, as it may indicate utter unresponsiveness to human values: the <I><FONT color=brown>remorseless</FONT></I> progress of a fatal disease; to <I><FONT color=brown>remorseless</FONT></I> ticking of a time bomb. <I><FONT color=brown>Relentless</FONT></I> is sometimes close to <I><FONT color=brown>remorseless</FONT></I> in this sense, but it is usually less severe and is not always damning by any means. In general use, it may apply to anyone or anything that shows no mercy and cannot be stopped by entreaty or appeal: a <I><FONT color=brown>relentless</FONT></I> prosecutor; the <I><FONT color=brown>relentless</FONT></I> passing of time. Specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>relentless</FONT></I> is sometimes used as in intensification of tireless. As such, it can imply a refusal to yield under punishing pressure: He pressed on <I><FONT color=brown>relentlessly</FONT></I>, trying to meet the deadline. Or it may focus on an implacable persistence in hounding another: to <I><FONT color=brown>relentless</FONT></I> Javert pursuing Jean Valjean in Les Misérables. <I><FONT color=brown>Unrelenting</FONT></I> may be less extreme in its implications, sometimes suggesting a proper rather than a cruel refusal to relent. An <I><FONT color=brown>unrelenting</FONT></I> person may not be impervious to entreaty, but he is able to resist it. He stands firm and does not give in when he might be expected or tempted to do so: The father handled his disobedient son with <I><FONT color=brown>unrelenting</FONT></I> firmness. <I><FONT color=brown>Unrelenting</FONT></I> may also suggest the unshakable resolve and fierce dedication of someone firmly committed to a cause and not to be turned aside by obstacles: an <I><FONT color=brown>unrelenting</FONT></I> crusader for women’s rights.</P><P>The remaining words imply unfeeling harshness or cruelty. <B><FONT color=blue>Merciless</FONT></B>, line <I><FONT color=brown>inexorable</FONT></I>, is often used of impersonal forces: subjected to a merc<I><FONT color=brown>i</FONT></I>less bombardment of noise; the <I><FONT color=brown>merciless</FONT></I> glare of the noonday sun. when it involves the agency of persons, it usually focuses on their instruments or acts rather than on their feelings: the <I><FONT color=brown>merciless</FONT></I> eye of the camera; a <I><FONT color=brown>merciless</FONT></I> beating. [A merciless mob of reporters descended on the bereaved family.] <I><FONT color=brown>Pitiless</FONT></I>, by contrast, is more often used to describe human beings as such. It suggests a cold, steel-hard quality: her <I><FONT color=brown>pitiless</FONT></I> eye; a <I><FONT color=brown>pitiless</FONT></I> tyrant. <I><FONT color=brown>Inexorable</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>relentless</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>pitiless</FONT></I> may all imply a refusal or inability to make or allow the slightest concession: <I><FONT color=brown>inexorable</FONT></I> logic; <I><FONT color=brown>relentless</FONT></I> reason; the pitiless efficiency of a machine.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ruthless</FONT></B> conveys a greater degree of harshness than any of these other words, for it focuses on a fierce refusal to give any quarter. It is applied to persons who are so unsparing as to be cruel, driving forward single-mindedly, and sometimes savagely, with a brutal disregard for those they attack or exploit: a <I><FONT color=brown>ruthless</FONT></I> slave driver; <I><FONT color=brown>ruthless</FONT></I> in his criticism; <I><FONT color=brown>ruthlessly</FONT></I> frank. Applied to personal expression or action, <I><FONT color=brown>ruthless</FONT></I> may mean harsh, brutal, unsparing, cold-blooded or cut-throat: <I><FONT color=brown>ruthless</FONT></I> methods; <I><FONT color=brown>ruthless</FONT></I> competition in the tournament finals.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Inevitable">INEVITABLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: alterable, changeable, clement, humane, lenient, placable, yielding.</P>

inexpensive
<B><FONT color=blue>inexpensive</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cheap</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>low-priced</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>modest</FONT></B>:

<P>These words describe things which bear, bring or involve low prices, or comparatively small amounts of money. That which is <B><FONT color=blue>inexpensive</FONT></B> costs little, but the word suggests that the product is of acceptable or even of good quality, and is not being misrepresented to the purchaser: <I><FONT color=brown>inexpensive</FONT></I> paperback books; an <I><FONT color=brown>inexpensive</FONT></I> raincoat one may carry folded up in one’s handbag.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Low-priced</FONT></B> is the most general term. It carries little connotation of true value or quality. When you say that something is low-priced you simply mean that it costs a small amount of money either in an absolute or a relative sense. [Wherever you may be, a packet of sewing needles is <I><FONT color=brown>low-priced</FONT></I>; Compact cars are <I><FONT color=brown>low-priced</FONT></I> as compared with cars of standard size.]</P><P>In one of its uses <B><FONT color=blue>cheap</FONT></B> has a derogatory meaning pointing to fraud, which <I><FONT color=brown>low-priced</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>inexpensive</FONT></I> do not have. The term "<I><FONT color=brown>cheap</FONT></I> labour" always strongly hints that exploitation of worker too backward or too deprived to protect their own interests. <I><FONT color=brown>Cheap</FONT></I> is applied to inferior, shoddy goods which to the inexperienced person resemble those of better quality and cost much more than they are worth: <I><FONT color=brown>cheap</FONT></I>, flashy furniture sold to the poor on hire purchase; <I><FONT color=brown>cheap</FONT></I> fur coats made of dyed rabbit skins. <I><FONT color=brown>Cheap</FONT></I> is also used to describe something that is very <I><FONT color=brown>inexpensive</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>low-priced</FONT></I> because it is plentiful, easy to produce, and useful: Linseed is a <I><FONT color=brown>cheap</FONT></I> but excellent source of protein for stock food. In the sense of costing less in proportion to its usual value or price, <I><FONT color=brown>cheap</FONT></I> is preferable to either <I><FONT color=brown>low-priced</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>inexpensive</FONT></I>: When the market is glutted vegetables are <I><FONT color=brown>cheap</FONT></I>.</P><P>In terms of money <B><FONT color=blue>modest</FONT></B> means moderate or not excessive, but it also implies that the amount of money in question is more or less adequate and proper: to ask a <I><FONT color=brown>modest</FONT></I> price for a second-hand television set; to earn a <I><FONT color=brown>modest</FONT></I> living as a part-time typist.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deficient">DEFICIENT</A>, <A href="entry://Poor">POOR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Expensive">EXPENSIVE</A>.</P>

infinite
<B><FONT color=blue>infinite</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>boundless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>illimitable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>limitless</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to great quantities or to things extending without end in space, time or number. <B><FONT color=blue>Infinite</FONT></B> is the most general here. Spatially, it refers to something that has no boundary: in a theory that space is <I><FONT color=brown>infinite</FONT></I>. It may be a less precise substitute for eternal: a kind of immortality that results if matter is finite and space <I><FONT color=brown>infinite</FONT></I>. It may refer strictly to quantity, as in mathematics, in which case it refers to a quantity that always exceeds any other. Theologically, it refers to something absolute or perfect: God’s <I><FONT color=brown>infinite</FONT></I> mercy. Often the word is used hyperbolically for any great amount, or simply as a superlative: an <I><FONT color=brown>infinite</FONT></I> bore.</P><P>The remaining words are primarily restricted to infinite quantities or size, but all may refer to things whose boundaries have not yet been discovered or cannot be formulated. In addition to these possibilities, <B><FONT color=blue>boundless</FONT></B> can specifically point to something that is unconstricted or unconstrictable: his <I><FONT color=brown>boundless</FONT></I> optimism. The word often refers hyperbolically to any great amount: the country’s <I><FONT color=brown>boundless</FONT></I> natural resources. <B><FONT color=blue>Limitless</FONT></B> suggests a situation in which no end is in sight or in which there is as much of something as could be used or desired: a <I><FONT color=brown>limitless</FONT></I> supply of drinking water; an artist’s <I><FONT color=brown>limitless</FONT></I> freedom to depict nature as he sees it in terms of form and colour. <B><FONT color=blue>Illimitable</FONT></B> is more formal than the previous words and suggests, in addition to its shared meanings, something to which no boundary can practicably be set. [Every source of energy in the universe theoretically emits waves that travel an <I><FONT color=brown>illimitable</FONT></I> distance.] The word may also suggest <I><FONT color=brown>infinite</FONT></I> extension in one dimension: defining a line as having <I><FONT color=brown>illimitable</FONT></I> length but no width.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Countless">COUNTLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Everlasting">EVERLASTING</A>, <A href="entry://Immortal">IMMORTAL</A>, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: circumscribed finite, limited, relative.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>influence</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>affect</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>impress</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sway</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all mean to have an effect upon a person’s behaviour thinking or feelings. <B><FONT color=blue>Influence</FONT></B> is to bring about a change in another’s actions or thoughts by persuasion, example or action, often of an indirect sort: <I><FONT color=brown>influenced</FONT></I> by a high-school biology teacher to take up the study of medicine; <I><FONT color=brown>influencing</FONT></I> workers to produce more goods by praising them and bettering their working conditions.</P><P>In this context <B><FONT color=blue>affect</FONT></B> means to have an effect on another’s feelings. [He is always deeply <I><FONT color=brown>affected</FONT></I> by Handel’s music; Fear <I><FONT color=brown>affects</FONT></I> some people by making them powerless to act.] <I><FONT color=brown>Influence</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>affect</FONT></I> may both be used of things that tend to respond to outside stimuli or actions. <I><FONT color=brown>Influence</FONT></I> is usually used in this sense of intangible forces, and <I><FONT color=brown>affect</FONT></I> of physical ones: to <I><FONT color=brown>influence</FONT></I> public opinion through the press; to <I><FONT color=brown>affect</FONT></I> the size of a crop by using fertilizer. Affect may sometimes imply an undesirable reaction: Unusual exertion may <I><FONT color=brown>affect</FONT></I> the heart.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Impress</FONT></B> means to affect deeply and lastingly: <I><FONT color=brown>impressed</FONT></I> by a man’s prodigious talent; <I><FONT color=brown>impressed</FONT></I> by his first sight of the Eiffel Tower.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sway</FONT></B> means to change another’s opinions or feelings successfully in a deliberate way.

<P>These words mean to call someone’s attention to something or to cause him to receive knowledge of it. <B><FONT color=blue>Inform</FONT></B> is the most general word and loosely covers the meanings of the other terms in this group. <I><FONT color=brown>Inform</FONT></I> usually points to the imparting of facts or data. [He <I><FONT color=brown>informed</FONT></I> his staff that he was going to Europe on business; This article <I><FONT color=brown>informs</FONT></I> us that Australia has the lowest standard of dental health in the world.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Advise</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>notify</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>apprise</FONT></B> carry the connotation of more or less formal announcements. <I><FONT color=brown>Advise</FONT></I>, in this context, is used in the sense of giving a person facts that involve his own interests: A lawyer should always <I><FONT color=brown>advise</FONT></I> his clients as to their legal rights. <I><FONT color=brown>Notify</FONT></I> is the most commonly used term of these three, and it carries a note of urgency, demanding action or an early reply. [The girl’s parents were <I><FONT color=brown>notified</FONT></I> immediately of her expulsion; He was <I><FONT color=brown>notified</FONT></I> by the Army to report for his medical examination.] <I><FONT color=brown>Apprise</FONT></I> is the most formal of these words and can sound dated or unnecessarily fancy.

<P>These words refer to people who divulge facts to which they are privy. Among its extremely informal or slangy companions, <B><FONT color=blue>informer</FONT></B> seems formal and dignified by comparison; it is also more general than the others. It often suggests divulging secrets or information concerning illegal or scandalous behaviour: turning <I><FONT color=brown>informer</FONT></I> on his cronies in the crime syndicate; encouraging children to act as <I><FONT color=brown>informers</FONT></I> against their parents. The disclosure itself may be covert or open and may be given out of vengeance, self-interest, or for pay. The <I><FONT color=brown>informer</FONT></I> may decide to disclose information he acquired in good faith, or he may have been intent at the outset on gaining and then betraying someone’s confidence: an <I><FONT color=brown>informer</FONT></I> planted by the police to get evidence on a suspected narcotics ring; publicly turning <I><FONT color=brown>informer</FONT></I> at the hearing to clear himself of a charge of complicity. The disapproving tone that <I><FONT color=brown>informer</FONT></I> can give is milder than that of any other word here. It can even have a neutral or approving tone: a Nazi who turned <I><FONT color=brown>informer</FONT></I> to help the prosecutors at the Nuremberg trials.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Blabbermouth</FONT></B>, by contrast, seldom suggests covert disclosure done in reprisal or self-interest. Instead, the word indicates general loose-Mouthed behaviour in someone willing to talk to anyone about anything, his own secrets as much as those of others: a <I><FONT color=brown>blabbermouth</FONT></I> who betrays his friends daily without even being conscious of it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tattler</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>talebearer</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tattletale</FONT></B> all can be used to describe someone who divulges facts about someone else. Each, however, has its special area of relevance. <I><FONT color=brown>Tattler</FONT></I> in particular relates to the collecting and spreading of trivial gossip of a faintly scandalous nature: professional <I><FONT color=brown>tattlers</FONT></I> who purport to reveal the private lives of the Hollywood stars. It may also suggest the situation in which one child betrays his playmates to a teacher, parent or other outsider; <I><FONT color=brown>tattletale</FONT></I> is perhaps more clearly related and restricted to such a context: the <I><FONT color=brown>tattletale</FONT></I> who went whining to the teacher about who had hidden the blackboard duster. <I><FONT color=brown>Talebearer</FONT></I> suggests to inform each side exclusively about the other: labour mediators who lose their effectiveness as soon as either side suspects them of being <I><FONT color=brown>talebearers</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fink</FONT></B> once was restricted to a U.S. labour context as an extremely pejorative way to refer to a turncoat who willingly informed on his follow workers to their employer. It and the more current <B><FONT color=blue>ratfink</FONT></B> are now fad words referring to anyone who is unsavoury, contemptible, ridiculous or inconsequential: the <I><FONT color=brown>fink</FONT></I> who stole my pencil; He acts tough, but in my book he’s just a spineless <I><FONT color=brown>fink</FONT></I>; My landlord is a real <I><FONT color=brown>ratfink</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Squealer</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stool pigeon</FONT></B> are the most slangy and also the most pejorative words in this group; both may suggest a context of the criminal underworld but are widely used outside it. <I><FONT color=brown>Squealer</FONT></I> may refer to someone who divulges facts about his confederates for whatever reason: swearing that he’d never be a <I><FONT color=brown>squealer</FONT></I> no matter how long the police questioned him. <I><FONT color=brown>Stool pigeon</FONT></I>, by contrast, refers specifically to a covert <I><FONT color=brown>informer</FONT></I> who inhabits the underworld or is planted there by the police: in either case, he furtively continues to convey information to the police so long as he remains undiscovered: convinced that one of their fellow prisoners had turned <I><FONT color=brown>stool pigeon</FONT></I> and had disclosed their plans for the gaolbreak.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Renegade">RENEGADE</A>.</P>

inherent
<B><FONT color=blue>inherent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>essential</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>innate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>intrinsic</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to things that are fundamental or necessary aspects of some larger pattern. <B><FONT color=blue>Inherent</FONT></B> refers to a principle that underlies or is implicit in a manifest pattern: an <I><FONT color=brown>inherent</FONT></I> tendency to get flustered in tense situations; a respect for human possibility that is <I><FONT color=brown>inherent</FONT></I> in all the works of the Renaissance. When the word emphasizes the implicit nature of the principle, it suggests something that may not be evident but that can be inferred from the situation: a cool politeness that attempted to mask her <I><FONT color=brown>inherent</FONT></I> dislike of people. <B><FONT color=blue>Innate</FONT></B> suggests something deeply imprinted within a pattern and which may not be patently obvious, although it has its effect and cannot, by implication, be easily eradicated: gathering evidence to determine whether instincts are <I><FONT color=brown>innate</FONT></I> or learned responses; tendencies <I><FONT color=brown>innate</FONT></I> in all governmental impulses towards collectivism.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Essential</FONT></B> does not necessarily suggest an underlying principle; something may be a quite evident and recent addition and still be <I><FONT color=brown>essential</FONT></I> if it is vital to the existence of the pattern to which it belongs: <I><FONT color=brown>essential</FONT></I> revisions in the proposed bill that made it acceptable to the necessary majority. Frequently, of course, the word does refer, like <I><FONT color=brown>inherent</FONT></I>, to fundamentals; even in this case, however, these fundamentals may be readily apparent rather than hidden or tacit: the <I><FONT color=brown>essential</FONT></I> figures on which our forecast is based. <B><FONT color=blue>Intrinsic</FONT></B> almost exclusively applies to fundamentals that underlie a larger design. The word suggests the irreducible minimum on which the design depends for its effectiveness; it also sometimes suggests that later or less <I><FONT color=brown>essential</FONT></I> excrescences may have coalesced about this minimum without necessarily impairing the functioning of the whole: the <I><FONT color=brown>intrinsic</FONT></I> decency of the common man, regardless of every failure to live up to his own promise; <I><FONT color=brown>intrinsic</FONT></I> weakness of design that makes the machine dangerous to operate ?weakness not easily overcome by the addition of safety features.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Basic">BASIC</A>, <A href="entry://Innate">INNATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Extraneous">EXTRANEOUS</A>.</P>

inheritance
<B><FONT color=blue>inheritance</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bequest</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>birthright</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>heritage</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>legacy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>patrimony</FONT></B>:

<P>These words indicate property willed to someone, or anything handed down from the past. <B><FONT color=blue>Inheritance</FONT></B> is the most general of these. At its strictest, it refers to both the real estate and personal property (including sums of money) left to someone in a will. This is usually acquired upon the death of the person who made the will, although sometimes it may be reserved until the one receiving it reaches a certain age or meets certain conditions. Occasionally, the word may be used to indicate real estate alone, especially a property or family home. In a more general sense, the word refers to anything handed down by one’s predecessors, from hereditary traits to cultural traditions: the <I><FONT color=brown>inheritance</FONT></I> of a recessive gene from his mother’s side the precious <I><FONT color=brown>inheritance</FONT></I> of freedom guaranteed us by the Constitution. <B><FONT color=blue>Bequest</FONT></B>, by contrast, functions solely in terms of willed personal property, often a sum of money, that comes to one by formal declaration upon the death of the donor: stipulating that a number of small <I><FONT color=brown>bequests</FONT></I> were to go to several close friends.</P><P>At their strictest, <B><FONT color=blue>legacy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>heritage</FONT></B> contrast, since <I><FONT color=brown>legacy</FONT></I> refers like <I><FONT color=brown>bequest</FONT></I> to a willed gift of money or personal property, while <I><FONT color=brown>heritage</FONT></I> refers, more like <I><FONT color=brown>inheritance</FONT></I>, to real property that goes by right to an heir. More significantly, however, both words are similar in referring generally to anything that has come down from the past. In this use, legacy is likely to refer to abstract things such as qualities, attitudes, principles or rights: the <I><FONT color=brown>legacy</FONT></I> of race hatred left to America by the institution of slavery; a new honesty about sexual matters, the <I><FONT color=brown>legacy</FONT></I> of Freud, Ellis and others. <I><FONT color=brown>Heritage</FONT></I> has a particular pertinence to enduring concrete things such as monuments, buildings or natural resources: our squandered <I><FONT color=brown>heritage</FONT></I> of untainted streams and virgin forest land; the cathedrals that are part of England’s invaluable <I><FONT color=brown>heritage</FONT></I>.</P><P>In their strict senses, <B><FONT color=blue>patrimony</FONT></B> refers to an estate, usually real, inherited from one’s father, while <B><FONT color=blue>birthright</FONT></B> can refer to property, real or personal, to which someone, especially a first-born son, is entitled by birth: Esau’s selling of his <I><FONT color=brown>birthright</FONT></I> for a mess of pottage. Much more commonly, however, both words are used in more general senses. Here, <I><FONT color=brown>patrimony</FONT></I> can refer to anything derived from one’s father or ancestors; thus, the word is a restriction of the general sense of <I><FONT color=brown>legacy</FONT></I>, referring to family or ancestral traditions: taking up the Barry more <I><FONT color=brown>patrimony</FONT></I> of theatrical accomplishment. Sometimes, however, the word is used even more generally, like <I><FONT color=brown>inheritance</FONT></I>: the rival <I><FONT color=brown>patrimonies</FONT></I>, still viable, of Athenian democracy and Spartan authoritarianism. In this context, <I><FONT color=brown>birthright</FONT></I> is used like <I><FONT color=brown>legacy</FONT></I>, though it is more emphatically reserved for qualities, attitudes, principles and especially rights to which every human being is thought entitled: our inalienable <I><FONT color=brown>birthright</FONT></I> of free speech; a U.N. declaration naming four specific freedoms as every person’s <I><FONT color=brown>birthright</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bequest">BEQUEST</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>inner</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>interior</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>internal</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inward</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to what lies below the surface, in the central or inside portion of something, or within its boundaries. <B><FONT color=blue>Inner</FONT></B> is the most general of these and has the widest range of meaning. It can have geographical pertinence: the <I><FONT color=brown>inner</FONT></I> regions of the island. It can refer to a side that faces in: the <I><FONT color=brown>inner</FONT></I> edge of the terrace. It can also indicate the enclosed portion of something: an <I><FONT color=brown>inner</FONT></I> room of the restaurant, available for private parties. In addition to these physical denotations, the word suggests covert or unconscious mental activity: signs of an <I><FONT color=brown>inner</FONT></I> turbulence of emotion; an <I><FONT color=brown>inner</FONT></I> ripeness for change.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Interior</FONT></B> also suggests the geographical context: the arid <I><FONT color=brown>interior</FONT></I> of Australia. It has a special relevance for something: hidden or obscure, suggesting enclosure: an <I><FONT color=brown>interior</FONT></I> courtyard of the Florentine variety. And it refers, most strictly, to thought processes that are carried on without being spoken aloud: <I><FONT color=brown>interior</FONT></I> monologue.</P><P>The emphasis with <B><FONT color=blue>internal</FONT></B> is on something completely surrounded and covered from view: the <I><FONT color=brown>internal</FONT></I> organs of the body; suspecting <I><FONT color=brown>internal</FONT></I> injuries. It can also refer to mental activity, relating less to <I><FONT color=brown>interior</FONT></I> in this context than to <I><FONT color=brown>inner</FONT></I>, although its point is often a distinction between feeling emotions and expressing them: an <I><FONT color=brown>internal</FONT></I> uneasiness that at last became apparent in his nervous pacing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inward</FONT></B> often refers to spiritual states: an <I><FONT color=brown>inward</FONT></I> rectitude of being. Sometimes its emphasis is on invisible as opposed to visible states: his outward behaviour testifying to an <I><FONT color=brown>inward</FONT></I> state of grace.

<P>These words refer to things that are perfect, free of fault or failing, or morally uncorrupted. <B><FONT color=blue>Innocent</FONT></B> pertains to freedom from immoral behaviour: <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I> children. This quality, however, may stem from self-restraint, inexperience or lack of opportunity: chaperons who made certain that the picnic remained at a level of <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I> fun. The word is often used more simply to denote lack of guilt for a wrongful act: declaring himself <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I> on all charges; an <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I> bystander.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Virginal</FONT></B> relates to the aspect of innocent pertaining to freedom from immoral behaviour; this word is much more restricted than <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I>, however, in specifically referring to chastity or to sexual immaturity, especially in women: his <I><FONT color=brown>virginal</FONT></I> bride. It may have a disapproving tone when this lack might be thought no longer appropriate or inherently admirable: a <I><FONT color=brown>virginal</FONT></I> spinster. Sometimes the word suggests the limpid sweetness of youth: the <I><FONT color=brown>virginal</FONT></I> faces of young girls. <B><FONT color=blue>Sinless</FONT></B> is wider in range than <I><FONT color=brown>virginal</FONT></I>, but more restricted than <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I> in pertaining exclusively to freedom from all sorts of behaviour thought immoral: impossible to live a completely <I><FONT color=brown>sinless</FONT></I> life. The word implies a supporting theological view, since what is praised as <I><FONT color=brown>sinless</FONT></I> by one religion might seem pointless or irrelevant to another: ascetics who strove towards a <I><FONT color=brown>sinless</FONT></I> life by abjuring the eating of meat.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Guiltless</FONT></B> functions more like <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I>. It can refer to freedom from immorality, though without the emphasis of innocent or <I><FONT color=brown>virginal</FONT></I> on youth: a politician <I><FONT color=brown>guiltless</FONT></I> of the more obvious kinds of cynical dealings. The word may also refer emphatically to blamelessness concerning a specific act <I><FONT color=brown>guiltless</FONT></I> of having murdered his wife. The word, however, never substitutes for <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I> in legal parlance. In the context of morality, <B><FONT color=blue>untainted</FONT></B> is used more abstractly than the previous words, referring to something that has never been sullied by any sort of harmful influence; in tone it seems more passive than <I><FONT color=brown>innocent</FONT></I>: an attitude <I><FONT color=brown>untainted</FONT></I> by selfish thoughts; a life <I><FONT color=brown>untainted</FONT></I> by scandal. The word has its own concrete relevance to anything pure: water <I><FONT color=brown>untainted</FONT></I> by bacteria.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Irreproachable</FONT></B> functions less on a theological or moral level than on the level of conduct, indicating a general propriety of behaviour: an <I><FONT color=brown>irreproachable</FONT></I> teacher where her interests in the students is concerned; a formal dinner that was <I><FONT color=brown>irreproachable</FONT></I> in every respect. <B><FONT color=blue>Blameless</FONT></B> operates, like <I><FONT color=brown>irreproachable</FONT></I>, in the sphere of ethics or conduct: <I><FONT color=brown>blameless</FONT></I> manners; a <I><FONT color=brown>blameless</FONT></I> life, finding him <I><FONT color=brown>blameless</FONT></I> of having caused the accident. <I><FONT color=brown>Blameless</FONT></I>, however, is more restricted to a simple lack of fault, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>irreproachable</FONT></I> may suggest a positive attainment of excellence: <I><FONT color=brown>blameless</FONT></I> but full acting, <I><FONT color=brown>irreproachable</FONT></I> taste that was astonishing for its flair.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chaste">CHASTE</A>, <A href="entry://Clean">CLEAN</A> (adj.), <A href="entry://Goodness">GOODNESS</A>, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>, NAÏVE, <A href="entry://Perfect">PERFECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: blameworthy, culpable, <A href="entry://Depraved">DEPRAVED</A>, <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, guilty, immoral, impure, <A href="entry://Indecent">INDECENT</A>, <A href="entry://Lewd">LEWD</A>, unchaste.</P>

<P>These words all mean a seeking for information or truth. <B><FONT color=blue>Inquiry</FONT></B> is the most general term and is loosely applicable to all the others. An <I><FONT color=brown>inquiry</FONT></I> may range in importance from any request for information about ordinary matters to an investigation of an official nature: to make <I><FONT color=brown>inquiries</FONT></I> at a service station concerning road directions; an <I><FONT color=brown>inquiry</FONT></I> made by the Health Department about a spreading epidemic of measles; an official <I><FONT color=brown>inquiry</FONT></I> into the cause of the derailment. <B><FONT color=blue>Enquiry</FONT></B> is an alternative spelling of this word.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Examination</FONT></B> is also a general term; but an <I><FONT color=brown>examination</FONT></I> is generally stricter or more formal than an <I><FONT color=brown>inquiry</FONT></I>, involving careful scrutiny or inspection: an <I><FONT color=brown>examination</FONT></I> of all the points in a formal argument; an <I><FONT color=brown>examination</FONT></I> of one’s motives for doing something. In law, an <I><FONT color=brown>examination</FONT></I> is an <I><FONT color=brown>inquiry</FONT></I> made by direct questioning or by the taking of evidence: The accused underwent <I><FONT color=brown>examination</FONT></I> by the Crown prosecutor.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>inquest</FONT></B> is an <I><FONT color=brown>inquiry</FONT></I> or examination, but its meaning is now almost entirely restricted to that of a legal investigation. In its best-known sense, an <I><FONT color=brown>inquest</FONT></I> is an investigation by a coroner of the causes of a death when there is sufficient evidence to suspect that it occurred for other than natural reasons.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inquisition</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>probe</FONT></B> are both searching, official investigations of an individual or of a group, made in order to dig out facts, generally with a view to proving the existence of illegal acts or of heterodoxy. <I><FONT color=brown>Inquisition</FONT></I> is chiefly thought of in its historical meaning, that of the examination and punishment of heretics, as practised by the ecclesiastical courts of Europe during the late Middle Ages and the Reformation. The term also is applied to the body of church officials engaged in this activity. In its more general sense, <I><FONT color=brown>inquisition</FONT></I> implies persecution by means of relentless investigation, and harassment by persistent and prolonged interrogation. <I><FONT color=brown>Probe</FONT></I> is an Americanism when used in the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>inquisition</FONT></I>, but is becoming popular elsewhere, especially in newspaper usage. It denotes an investigation that goes deeply below the surface in a manner reminiscent of a surgeon’s instrument exploring a gunshot wound. A <I><FONT color=brown>probe</FONT></I> may be made either by a legislative body or by a committee set up within such a body, into alleged misconduct or illegal practices on a large scale: a <I><FONT color=brown>probe</FONT></I> into a tax evasion on the part of a large company; a <I><FONT color=brown>probe</FONT></I> into the misuse of public funds.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>study</FONT></B> is an <I><FONT color=brown>inquiry</FONT></I> made by gathering information in some detail in order to arrive at certain conclusions or to obtain a body of specialized knowledge: a <I><FONT color=brown>study</FONT></I> of the habits of the mountain gorilla; a <I><FONT color=brown>study</FONT></I> of the sluggish currents of the Sargasso Sea. <I><FONT color=brown>Studies</FONT></I> are also conducted to gain an understanding of the causes of an undesirable social condition so that improvements may be made: a <I><FONT color=brown>study</FONT></I> of the traffic situation in a large city; a <I><FONT color=brown>study</FONT></I> of the incidence of relapse in mental illness.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Examine">EXAMINE</A>, <A href="entry://Pierce">PIERCE</A>, <A href="entry://Question">QUESTION</A> (n.), <A href="entry://Question">QUESTION</A> (v.).</P>

To <B><FONT color=blue>insert</FONT></B> a letter, word or group of words is simply to put it in, often where it has a perfect right to be. Specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>insert</FONT></I> suggests that a space must be made in written or printed matter so that the addition may be fitted in: to <I><FONT color=brown>insert</FONT></I> an ad in newspaper. A caret [<FONT face=Symbol>Ù</FONT> ] marks the spot where an omitted word or letter is to be <I><FONT color=brown>inserted</FONT></I> in a line. To <B><FONT color=blue>interpolate</FONT></B> a word, passage or comment is to <I><FONT color=brown>insert</FONT></I> it where it does not belong ?among words written or spoken by and attributed to another. <I><FONT color=brown>Interpolations</FONT></I> such as editorial comments, explanations and helpful emendations are permissible if enclosed in square brackets, as in: "The plot was obviously inspired by [Molière’s] <I><FONT color=brown>Les preciéuses ridicules</FONT></I>, one reviewer wrote." Interpolations that are not permissible are additions made by other hands that are passed off as part of the author’s original, for such <I><FONT color=brown>interpolated</FONT></I> matter corrupts the original text. To <B><FONT color=blue>introduce</FONT></B> something into a speech or piece of writing is to bring it in not only as an added part, or insertion, but as a new part, a change from what is already there. [He was told that his speech would be more effective if he <I><FONT color=brown>introduced</FONT></I> examples to illustrate his points; After Shakespeare’s death, lesser playwrights <I><FONT color=brown>introduced</FONT></I> changes into his plays, <I><FONT color=brown>interpolating</FONT></I> spurious passages, stage directions, spectacle and music.]</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>interject</FONT></B> and the more formal <B><FONT color=blue>interpose</FONT></B> may mean to <I><FONT color=brown>introduce</FONT></I> abruptly.

What is <I><FONT color=brown>interjected</FONT></I> is simply thrown in unexpectedly and forcefully, as an exclamation arising from a natural reaction. [When that politician’s name was mentioned, the doctor <I><FONT color=brown>interjected</FONT></I> an oath into the conversation.] What is <I><FONT color=brown>interposed</FONT></I> is put in as a deliberate interruption, such as a protest or digression, and is meant to halt the speech or argument going on. [A student interrupted the lecturer, ostensibly to ask a question, but actually to <I><FONT color=brown>interpose</FONT></I> his own opinion; When the witness began to shout angrily at his cross-examiner, the judge <I><FONT color=brown>interposed</FONT></I> a stern rebuke.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Add">ADD</A>, <A href="entry://Mediate">MEDIATE</A>, <A href="entry://Revise">REVISE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: abstract, detach, <A href="entry://Erase">ERASE</A>, </P>

[People thought him well-to-do, but he died <I><FONT color=brown>insolvent</FONT></I>, his estate being insufficient to liquidate his debts; The ill-starred company survived from less than a year before becoming <I><FONT color=brown>insolvent</FONT></I>.] In law, <B><FONT color=blue>bankrupt</FONT></B> refers specifically to a person who or business which has been judicially declared <I><FONT color=brown>insolvent</FONT></I>. When, through the operation of a <I><FONT color=brown>bankruptcy</FONT></I> law, the actual <I><FONT color=brown>insolvency</FONT></I> of a debtor has been legally determined and his estate has been sequestrated, his assets are taken into judicial possession for equitable distribution among his creditors. The debtor, himself, is afterwards granted by judicial decree a full discharge from legal liability for his indebtedness. For this reason, someone deeply and hopelessly in debt may choose to or have to declare himself <I><FONT color=brown>bankrupt</FONT></I>. [His business failed and he went <I><FONT color=brown>bankrupt</FONT></I>; the business went into <I><FONT color=brown>bankruptcy</FONT></I>.] Loosely, any person who is unable to pay his debts in full may be called <I><FONT color=brown>bankrupt</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Bankrupt</FONT></I>, in a popular sense, may also refer to utter ruin of any kind. In a figurative sense, it may mean destitute of some abstract quality, or hopelessly lacking, as in spiritual resources: a morally <I><FONT color=brown>bankrupt</FONT></I> society; a man <I><FONT color=brown>bankrupt</FONT></I> in spirit.</P><P>The remaining words focus on a lack of money rather than on indebtedness, implying empty pockets rather than red ink. <B><FONT color=blue>Broke</FONT></B> is the colloquial, everyday word. It is sometimes used informally as a substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>insolvent</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>bankrupt</FONT></I>: The business kept losing money and finally went <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I>. But <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I> is much broader in application than the previous pair of words. A person who cannot pay his bills may claim, or be said, to be <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I>; but a person may also be <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I> without being in debt. Further, <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I> often applies to a temporary condition: a speculator often <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I> but never poor; flat <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I> the day before payday; coming home from the races stony <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Impecunious</FONT></B> comes from Latin roots and literally means without money. It may refer to a person who never has much money or who is frequently <I><FONT color=brown>broke</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>impecunious</FONT></I> artist living in a garret. But it is a rather high-flown, pretentious word and is often in used a self-conscious way to give a humorous, lightly mocking effect. [Sorry I can’t go with you, but I’m rather <I><FONT color=brown>impecunious</FONT></I> at the moment.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Poor">POOR</A>, <A href="entry://Wealth">WEALTH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: affluent flush, loaded, prosperous, rich, solvent, wealthy, well-to-do.</P>

<P>These words mean to have in mind the doing of some act or the attainment of some goal. <B><FONT color=blue>Intend</FONT></B> has the widest range of implication. It may involve no more than vague thoughts or half-hearted resolves. [I <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I> to clean out the spare room sooner or later; always <I><FONT color=brown>intending</FONT></I> but never doing.] Or it may imply a firm decision taken with regard to an immediate or ultimate goal. [I <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I> to see to it that my son is not late again; They <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I> to work hard and save to put their children through university.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mean</FONT></B> is synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I> in both its strong and its weak sense, implying either a truly firm resolve or a merely professed purpose. [I <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I> to go, and nothing is going to stop me; I’ve been <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> to write to you for weeks.] But <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I> is a less formal word than <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I>, well suited to everyday speech and writing; and it is more often used than <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I> to express a dubious, weak or unrealized resolve. [I mean to visit her, but I never got round to it.] Mean is also used to claim or give credit for good intentions when an action has backfired. [I’m sure he meant well; I meant no harm ?I only meant to help.] Aim, like mean, is informal in tone. It points, though, to an actual goal, purpose or intention, as distinguished from an avowed one that is open to doubt. [What do you aim to do?; I aim to succeed.] Further, aim may imply not only intent but also efforts, though without the suggestion of failure often conveyed by mean. [I aim to please.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Propose</FONT></B>, in one sense, is closely synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I>: he <I><FONT color=brown>proposes</FONT></I> to go on to university after high school. But <I><FONT color=brown>propose</FONT></I> generally goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>aim</FONT></I> in implying that an intention or design has been clearly formulated in the mind, and often announced to others. [What do you <I><FONT color=brown>propose</FONT></I> to do?; I <I><FONT color=brown>propose</FONT></I> to rally the forces and attack at dawn; The Council <I><FONT color=brown>proposes</FONT></I> to build an additional child-minding centre in the city.] <B><FONT color=blue>Plan</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I>, may sometimes imply only a vague goal or indefinite resolution that is not being currently acted upon: He <I><FONT color=brown>plans</FONT></I> to go to Europe some day. But <I><FONT color=brown>plan</FONT></I> may be, and often is, much more definite than <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I>, implying the taking of active steps towards the realization of an intention. Such <I><FONT color=brown>planning</FONT></I> involves a consideration of the ways and means of achieving a goal and the making of arrangements, in advance. [I <I><FONT color=brown>plan</FONT></I> to leave on August 4, have made airline reservations for the date, and have applied for a passport.] In an intransitive sense, <I><FONT color=brown>plan</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>propose</FONT></I> may be closely synonymous. [He is always <I><FONT color=brown>planning</FONT></I> but seldom carries through with his schemes; Man never does all that he <I><FONT color=brown>proposes</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Propose</FONT></I> may also mean to make an offer of marriage.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>contemplate</FONT></B> is to consider or anticipate, to turn over in the mind. <I><FONT color=brown>Contemplate</FONT></I> implies a greater immediacy than <I><FONT color=brown>intend</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>aim</FONT></I> but much less definiteness than <I><FONT color=brown>propose</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>plan</FONT></I>. [She <I><FONT color=brown>intends</FONT></I> to get married when she grows up; He is <I><FONT color=brown>contemplating</FONT></I> marriage but has not yet <I><FONT color=brown>proposed</FONT></I>; She is <I><FONT color=brown>contemplating</FONT></I> a trip to Europe, but she hasn’t <I><FONT color=brown>planned</FONT></I> it yet.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Decide">DECIDE</A>, <A href="entry://Hope">HOPE</A>, <A href="entry://Mean">MEAN</A>, <A href="entry://Offer">OFFER</A>, <A href="entry://Plan">PLAN</A>, <A href="entry://Purpose">PURPOSE</A>, <A href="entry://Try">TRY</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to make submissive, compliant or subdued by inspiring fear. <B><FONT color=blue>Intimidate</FONT></B> is the most general word, precisely directed to this concept. To <I><FONT color=brown>intimidate</FONT></I> someone is to manipulate him by using his own fear or weakness against him as a psychological weapon. The person who sets out to <I><FONT color=brown>intimidate</FONT></I> another aims to fill the chosen victim with a dread of unpleasant consequences to come if he does not comply. [The employer tried to <I><FONT color=brown>intimidate</FONT></I> his employees from staging rolling strikes by threatening to close down the entire plant; The parents were <I><FONT color=brown>intimidated</FONT></I> into paying the ransom by the kidnapper’s threatening notes; The quiet levelling of the highwayman’s pistol <I><FONT color=brown>intimidated</FONT></I> the driver of the stage.] <I><FONT color=brown>Intimidation</FONT></I> may involve the use of violence or coercion to influence the conduct of another or to compel his consent; but when actual force is used it constitutes a threat of future force that would be more deadly: The accused’s friends <I><FONT color=brown>intimidated</FONT></I> the witness by bashing him in a dark alley. A person may also be <I><FONT color=brown>intimidated</FONT></I> through his own shyness, cowardice, sense of inadequacy, or fear or embarrassment: so <I><FONT color=brown>intimidated</FONT></I> by the speaker’s fame that they were afraid to ask him questions; <I><FONT color=brown>intimidated</FONT></I> by the surly waiter’s sneer into leaving a larger tip than they had intended.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cow</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>overawe</FONT></B> point both to the cause and to the effect of <I><FONT color=brown>intimidation</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Cow</FONT></I> in this sense comes from an Old Norse word meaning to tyrannize over. To <I><FONT color=brown>cow</FONT></I> someone is to reduce him to a weak, submissive state, breaking his spirit or overcoming his resistance by the use or threat of superior force: a tyrant of a father who <I><FONT color=brown>cowed</FONT></I> his children’s spirits; cringing slaves, <I><FONT color=brown>cowed</FONT></I> by the overseer’s whip; suddenly cowed by the sight of a policeman. Overawe does not imply the kind of fear and trembling suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>cow</FONT></I>. Instead, it focuses on reverential fear ?respect that subdues or restrains one. [The peasants were <I><FONT color=brown>overawed</FONT></I> by the vastness of the cathedral; The explorer <I><FONT color=brown>overawed</FONT></I> the natives with his fine clothes and fancy equipment.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Daunt</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dismay</FONT></B> deal specifically with the kind of effect caused by intimidation. To <I><FONT color=brown>daunt</FONT></I> is to dishearten, frighten or otherwise discourage someone from going on; it implies a loss of the will to keep trying. [Outback life <I><FONT color=brown>daunted</FONT></I> her and she went back to Sydney; No number of failures and disappointments could <I><FONT color=brown>daunt</FONT></I> him in his quest for a cure.] <I><FONT color=brown>Dismay</FONT></I> suggests a sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach. It points to a sense of hopeless discouragement in the face of obstacles or paralysing fear in the face of a threat. [Their utter refusal to compromise <I><FONT color=brown>dismayed</FONT></I> him and left him at a loss; a contender in the ring, <I><FONT color=brown>dismayed</FONT></I> by the size and fierceness of his opponent.]</P><P>The remaining words all focus on the act of <I><FONT color=brown>intimidating</FONT></I> another. <B><FONT color=blue>Stand over</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>terrorize</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bully</FONT></B> imply the deliberate incitement of fear as a method of intimidation. <I><FONT color=brown>Stand over</FONT></I> is an informal idiom meaning to adopt a threatening attitude without necessarily involving direct violence. He will continue the work no matter who tries to <I><FONT color=brown>stand over</FONT></I> him; <I><FONT color=brown>stand-over</FONT></I> tactics. <I><FONT color=brown>Terrorize</FONT></I> is the more formal word and presupposes a much greater degree of violence. It has political associations, often applying to unlawful acts of violence committed in an attempt to overthrow a government: Rebels <I><FONT color=brown>terrorized</FONT></I> the countryside, staging midnight raids, planting land mines in the roads, and exacting tribute from the people. <I><FONT color=brown>Bully</FONT></I> is much more informal. As a noun, it denotes a swaggering, aggressive person who is usually cowardly at heart and who intimidates weaker people. Children use the word for a larger or stronger child, usually a bigger boy, who picks on smaller or weaker ones. Hence to <I><FONT color=brown>bully</FONT></I> is to push others around in this way, whether through brute force or through verbal taunts or threats: They had stood for hours, but he <I><FONT color=brown>bullied</FONT></I> them into letting him break into the queue ahead of them. <B><FONT color=blue>Bulldoze</FONT></B> falls between <I><FONT color=brown>bully</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>terrorize</FONT></I> in force. It is a slang term that originated in the United States, pointing to <I><FONT color=brown>intimidation</FONT></I> through the use of violence or coercion or through the threat of reprisals. Like stand over, it may imply force of will or exercise of abstract power rather than physical force: They tried to <I><FONT color=brown>bulldoze</FONT></I> him, but he stuck to his guns. <I><FONT color=brown>Bulldoze</FONT></I> is frequently used for this notion of unrelenting pressure to get something done quickly, against all objection or demand for consideration. [The bill was <I><FONT color=brown>bulldozed</FONT></I> through Parliament in the last minutes of the sitting; one obdurate juror trying to <I><FONT color=brown>bulldoze</FONT></I> the others into changing their minds.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Browbeat</FONT></B> implies mental harassment rather than a physical attack. To <I><FONT color=brown>browbeat</FONT></I> someone is to <I><FONT color=brown>intimidate</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>cow</FONT></I> him, or to try to do so, by means of a stern, overbearing, condemnatory manner. <I><FONT color=brown>Browbeat</FONT></I> may imply haughty, contemptuous or rude treatment, or a bombardment of some kind that goes on without respite. [He was a meek little man, the perfect victim, <I><FONT color=brown>browbeaten</FONT></I> by his boss at the office and by his wife at home; The lawyer started <I><FONT color=brown>browbeating</FONT></I> the witness, trying to upset him and discredit his testimony.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Beleaguer">BELEAGUER</A>, <A href="entry://Brave">BRAVE</A>, <A href="entry://Compel">COMPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Frighten">FRIGHTEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: blandish, <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>, enhearten, <A href="entry://Induce">INDUCE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to secret plans contrived to attain some possibly improper or illegal goal. <B><FONT color=blue>Intrigue</FONT></B> stresses behind-the-scenes manipulations, but it may or may not imply impropriety or illegality: a court rife with <I><FONT color=brown>intrigue</FONT></I> against the emperor’s life; adept at the <I><FONT color=brown>intrigue</FONT></I> necessary to carry on a clandestine love affair; small-town <I><FONT color=brown>intrigue</FONT></I> that amounted to nothing more than trivial gossip. <I><FONT color=brown>Intrigue</FONT></I> may be a collective noun for the sum total of secret manoeuvring in a given social context. <B><FONT color=blue>Machination</FONT></B> more often refers, less inclusively, to a secret or semi-secret stratagem a devious action or an underhand manoeuvre that is part of a larger plan. It usually appears in the plural and suggests, disapprovingly, some impropriety of motive: <I><FONT color=brown>machinations</FONT></I> to make it appear that the innocent girl had committed the murder.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Plot</FONT></B> suggests a specific, inclusive plan worked out in detail by a person or group, most often to gain some improper or illegal goal: the <I><FONT color=brown>plot</FONT></I> to assassinate Caesar; a <I><FONT color=brown>plot</FONT></I> to rig a union ballot. <I><FONT color=brown>Intrigue</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>machinations</FONT></I> may be resorted to as elements in furthering a plot or in its final carrying out. Both most often suggest subservience to the kind of master plan indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>plot</FONT></I>: certain that a <I><FONT color=brown>plot</FONT></I> of some sort was under way from the amount of intrigue he caught wind of.</P><P>A <I><FONT color=brown>plot</FONT></I> may sometimes be petty in scope, but <B><FONT color=blue>conspiracy</FONT></B> is applied chiefly to serious crimes, and there is something sinister about the word Specifically, in this sense, a <I><FONT color=brown>conspiracy</FONT></I> is a <I><FONT color=brown>plot</FONT></I> involving two or more persons who plan together to commit an evil or unlawful act: a <I><FONT color=brown>conspiracy</FONT></I> to overthrow the military junta; A team of special investigators uncovered a price-fixing <I><FONT color=brown>conspiracy</FONT></I> in the industry.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scheme</FONT></B> is much more general than the other words in this group. Nothing improper or illegal at all may be referred to; the word, in fact, might point exclusively to the devising rather than to the furthering or carrying out of a plan: suddenly coming up with a <I><FONT color=brown>scheme</FONT></I> that would solve their money problems. But <I><FONT color=brown>scheme</FONT></I>, unlike plan, often carries an unfavourable connotation, implying something underhanded and self-serving: the <I><FONT color=brown>scheming</FONT></I> Iago, devising a way to bring about his successful rival’s downfall.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accomplice">ACCOMPLICE</A>, <A href="entry://Conspiracy">CONSPIRACY</A>, <A href="entry://Plan">PLAN</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>invariable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>constant</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unchanging</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>uniform</FONT></B>:

<P>These words apply to things that are not marked by change or variation. Something is <B><FONT color=blue>invariable</FONT></B> if it recurs always in the same manner or at regular intervals. The succession of neap tide and spring tide is <I><FONT color=brown>invariable</FONT></I>. Something is <B><FONT color=blue>constant</FONT></B> if it remains the same or changes at a regular rate over a long period of time. The birth rate in some countries is <I><FONT color=brown>constant</FONT></I>, and in other countries the rate of population increase is <I><FONT color=brown>constant</FONT></I>. In mathematics and science, a <I><FONT color=brown>constant</FONT></I> is a number or quantity that does not change throughout a given discussion or operation. An absolute <I><FONT color=brown>constant</FONT></I> is fixed and cannot be changed. An arbitrary <I><FONT color=brown>constant</FONT></I> can be assigned any set value. In a more general sense, <I><FONT color=brown>invariable</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>constant</FONT></B> may simply mean continual or habitual. [She <I><FONT color=brown>invariably</FONT></I> forgets to take her keys; She is <I><FONT color=brown>constantly</FONT></I> changing her mind.] And while <I><FONT color=brown>invariable</FONT></I> more often applies to routine, both words may be used of abstract qualities that are enduring or reliable: an <I><FONT color=brown>invariable</FONT></I> stop at the corner news-stand; <I><FONT color=brown>constant</FONT></I> affection; <I><FONT color=brown>invariable</FONT></I> amiability.</P><P>Something is <B><FONT color=blue>unchanging</FONT></B> in this sense if its attributes remain the same for a long period of time. Weather and climate may be said to be <I><FONT color=brown>unchanging</FONT></I> in certain areas of the world. The biological processes of life may be called <I><FONT color=brown>unchanging</FONT></I>.</P><P>In one sense, <B><FONT color=blue>uniform</FONT></B> is close to constant, describing something that does not undergo changes in form or character, quantity or degree: a thermostat to maintain a <I><FONT color=brown>uniform</FONT></I> temperature. In another sense, <I><FONT color=brown>uniform</FONT></I> may suggest a bringing of separate things into a state of conformity, either basically or in some salient aspect: progress towards the adoption of a <I><FONT color=brown>uniform</FONT></I> building code; The hedges were clipped to a <I><FONT color=brown>uniform</FONT></I> height; all twenty volumes of the encyclopaedia were of <I><FONT color=brown>uniform</FONT></I> thickness.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Immutable">IMMUTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>, <A href="entry://Persistent">PERSISTENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Inconstant">INCONSTANT</A>, variable.</P>

<P>These words are used to describe a brisk, unworried, self-assured person or the way in which he acts. <B><FONT color=blue>Jaunty</FONT></B>, which at its most positive refers to a lively, dashing urbanity, sometimes suggests a studied nonchalance ?an attempt, often contrived or even forced, to be suave or sophisticated which results in a kind of aggressive good humour: struggling to look <I><FONT color=brown>jaunty</FONT></I> and interesting in his yachting outfit; the <I><FONT color=brown>jaunty</FONT></I> way he approached to ask her for a dance. <B><FONT color=blue>Chipper</FONT></B> refers more to a sprightly self-satisfaction that exudes good humour and health; the word would refer to the good health of maturity rather than that of youth: Ageing roués who still manage to look spruce and <I><FONT color=brown>chipper</FONT></I> are the despair of the moralist.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Debonair</FONT></B> is more like jaunty in suggesting a reckless ease of manner that is filled with carefree good spirits: the typically <I><FONT color=brown>debonair</FONT></I> French lover.

<P>These words refer to forms of popular music that ultimately derive from the folk cultures of the U.S. South. Most of them share a stress on emphatic rhythm and improvisatory melodic lines. <B><FONT color=blue>Jazz</FONT></B> is the generic word under which nearly all the remaining terms can be grouped. In itself it can apply descriptively to any such music, regardless of period, style or the number of musicians involved: a small <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I> combo; the influence of spirituals on the development of <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I> vocalist; big-band <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I>; the new sounds in <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Blues</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ragtime</FONT></B> are the earliest forms of <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I>; both were evolved by American Negroes. <I><FONT color=brown>Blues</FONT></I> typically refers to songs whose lyrics have three-line stanzas in which the first and second line are alike. They were sung and played in a slow tempo and were in major keys (as is most <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I>), but with unconventional scale degrees (blue notes) such as flatted thirds and certain unusual harmonies. The mood expressed was of grief, melancholy or despair: the <I><FONT color=brown>blues</FONT></I> singing of <I><FONT color=brown>Bessie Smith</FONT></I>. Later, the word has been applied less exactly to any <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I> or commercial music reflecting some of these qualities. <I><FONT color=brown>Ragtime</FONT></I> refers classically to an early form of piano <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I>, originating in and around St. Louis, based on European marches and dance tunes but played with a characteristic syncopated Negro rhythm. The word came to be used loosely to refer to Negro-inspired popular music in general and thus was the predecessor to the word <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I> (originally <I><FONT color=brown>jass</FONT></I>): Alexander’s <I><FONT color=brown>Ragtime</FONT></I> Band (1911).</P><P>The Original Dixie Land Jass Band, a white group, made the New Orleans ensemble style of Negro popular music a rage in America in 1917 and established the word jazz in popular usage. <B><FONT color=blue>Dixieland</FONT></B>, meaning New Orleans-style jazz as played by white performers and not merely a term of geographical ascription, did not come into use until the 1940s: <I><FONT color=brown>Dixieland</FONT></I> at Eddie Condon’s. <B><FONT color=blue>Swing</FONT></B> evolved in the 1930s from the ensemble <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I> of both white and Negro groups as bands became bigger and more theatrical and orchestral arrangements more polished; it puts more stress on coordinated teamwork than on improvisation: Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman set the tone for the age of <I><FONT color=brown>swing</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Boogie-woogie</FONT></B> is a kind of piano <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I> in which improvisations on a blues melody with the right hand are played over a repetitive eight-to-a-bar figure in the left. <I><FONT color=brown>Swing</FONT></I> arrangement of <I><FONT color=brown>boogie-woogie</FONT></I> pieces were sometimes written: a <I><FONT color=brown>boogie-woogie</FONT></I> number played by Count Basie’s band.</P><P>In New York City, bold Negro jazz experimentalists in the late 1940s developed re-bop, which became be-bop and finally <B><FONT color=blue>bop</FONT></B>. This music emphasized far-ranging improvisations on standard themes set off by closely woven ensemble work that featured pungent harmonies (such as the use of chords with a flatted fifth) and polyphonic lines. This music did not become popular in turn as <I><FONT color=brown>swing</FONT></I> had been, but it was adopted by musicians, both white and black, and won the interest of an intellectual and avant-garde coterie. In contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>rhythm-and-blues</FONT></B> (of shortened to "<I><FONT color=brown>R and B</FONT></I>") have kept their hold on a mass audience of American Negroes since the "race records" of the 1920s; with their roots in the experience of rural Negroes moving to the great cities of the North, they are an authentic urban folk music, still meeting the needs of those for whom it is written.</P><P>In the 1950s <B><FONT color=blue>rock ‘n’roll</FONT></B> fused elements of <I><FONT color=brown>rhythm-and-blues</FONT></I>, not yet generally popular, and aspects of Southern white "country music" to achieve such popularity as to sweep other forms of popular music and even of <I><FONT color=brown>jazz</FONT></I>, its distant relative, from public attention. This music emphasized an unvarying (even monotonous), heavy, rhythmic beat and lyrics expressive of pre-adolescent sentiments. Nearly all popular music in general, or some mixture of these. In the 1960s <I><FONT color=brown>rock ‘n’roll</FONT></I> was shortened to <B><FONT color=blue>rock</FONT></B> to describe a later development of this music in which as few as four musicians sing and play together in close coordination; <I><FONT color=brown>rock</FONT></I> stresses quite conventional harmonies, a driving but less inflexible rhythmic impulse, and free-and-easy lyrics that violate accepted <I><FONT color=brown>blues</FONT></I> or popular song patterns: folk <I><FONT color=brown>rock</FONT></I>; acid <I><FONT color=brown>rock</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Melody">MELODY</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote something said or done to excite laughter. <B><FONT color=blue>Joke</FONT></B> is a general term, but specifically it refers to a brief narrative or anecdote with a funny ending. A practical <I><FONT color=brown>joke</FONT></I> is an act designed to surprise or embarrass another. <B><FONT color=blue>Jest</FONT></B>, which now sounds somewhat old-fashioned except in the phrase in <I><FONT color=brown>jest</FONT></I>, usually refers to an oral remark, but may also be a playful act.</P><P>Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>joke</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>jest</FONT></I> emphasize humour, <B><FONT color=blue>witticism</FONT></B> points to a more intellectual exercise ?that of wit ?depending a good deal more on originality or irony of thought. <B><FONT color=blue>Quip</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pleasantry</FONT></B> are, respectively, a sharp and mild instance of a comment intended to amuse, the former often imparting a sting and the latter scrupulously avoiding any painful effect.

Like <I><FONT color=brown>quip</FONT></I>, but even more strongly, <I><FONT color=brown>wisecrack</FONT></I> implies a mocking or satirical motive. <I><FONT color=brown>Gag</FONT></I> often refers to a theatrical joke, as one prepared in advance of a performance. One speaks of the <I><FONT color=brown>witticisms</FONT></I> of statesmen, the <I><FONT color=brown>wisecrack</FONT></I> of political commentators, and the <I><FONT color=brown>gags</FONT></I> of nightclub comedians.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Caricature">CARICATURE</A>, <A href="entry://Ridicule">RIDICULE</A>.</P>

<P>These words describe exhilarated or joyful states of mind. <B><FONT color=blue>Joyous</FONT></B> suggests a strong feeling of contentment or high spirits, often because of the expectation or realization of some good: <I><FONT color=brown>joyous</FONT></I> celebrations in anticipation of the end of war. <I><FONT color=brown>Joyous</FONT></I> is sometimes applied to people as synonym for joyful, but is also used of something that promotes joy or is in itself an expression of joy: the <I><FONT color=brown>joyous</FONT></I> song of the thrush.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Happy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>glad</FONT></B> are the most general words of this group, but are also the weakest, since they do not ordinarily imply the excitement and strong feeling indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>joyous</FONT></I> and by some of the other words. In social exchange <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>glad</FONT></I> are used in mild expression of enjoyment or willingness. [I shall be <I><FONT color=brown>glad</FONT></I> to help you find a new job; We are very <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I> to see you.] In its wider sense <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I> suggests tranquil contentment and fulfilment of one’s aspirations and desires: to be <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I> in one’s work; to have a <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I> marriage.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ecstatic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>elated</FONT></B> both emphasize greater joy and delight than does <I><FONT color=brown>happy</FONT></I>. From its earlier meaning of being in a trancelike state of religious fervour, <I><FONT color=brown>ecstatic</FONT></I> suggests such an overpowering joy or mental exaltation that one is beside oneself: a young boy <I><FONT color=brown>ecstatic</FONT></I> in his first love; a travller <I><FONT color=brown>ecstatic</FONT></I> over the art treasures of Florence. <I><FONT color=brown>Elated</FONT></I>, less forceful than <I><FONT color=brown>ecstatic</FONT></I>, points to the great pleasure and self-satisfaction arising from success or good fortune: a novelist <I><FONT color=brown>elated</FONT></I> over the favourable reviews of his book; a young father <I><FONT color=brown>elated</FONT></I> over the birth of twins.</P><P>A person who is <B><FONT color=blue>euphoric</FONT></B> may outwardly resemble in behaviour one who is <I><FONT color=brown>ecstatic</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>elated</FONT></I>; however, upon closer observation, it will be seen that his vigour and buoyancy are exaggerated and out of proportion to the situation at hand. Although experienced at one time or another by most people, <I><FONT color=brown>euphoria</FONT></I> is commonly thought of as occurring during the course of certain mental disturbances or after the ingestion of alcoholic beverages or of certain drugs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>High</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>turned on</FONT></B> are informal terms used to describe more or less artificially induced exhilaration or <I><FONT color=brown>euphoria</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>High</FONT></I> is used most commonly and colloquially of a person who is animated and talkative after drinking an alcoholic beverage. [He usually gets quite <I><FONT color=brown>high</FONT></I> on just two drinks.] <I><FONT color=brown>High</FONT></I> is also applied in a slang sense to one who has taken a narcotic drug and is experiencing the resultant <I><FONT color=brown>euphoria</FONT></I> or contented lethargy. <I><FONT color=brown>Turned on</FONT></I>, a current slang term that originated among psychedelic drug users, is more frequently found as a verb than as an adjective. In its narrowest sense, to turn on means either to begin feeling the effect of a marijuana cigarette or to introduce a neophyte to the practice. [Every Saturday night they and a group of their friends <I><FONT color=brown>turn on</FONT></I>; Last week his flat-mate <I><FONT color=brown>turned</FONT></I> him <I><FONT color=brown>on</FONT></I>.] It may also mean to take or be under the influence of any narcotic or psychedelic drug: <I><FONT color=brown>turned on</FONT></I> with LSD. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>turn on</FONT></I> may also mean to excite or strongly attract. [Bach’s music always <I><FONT color=brown>turns</FONT></I> him <I><FONT color=brown>on</FONT></I>; Men with soulful brown eyes always seem to <I><FONT color=brown>turn</FONT></I> her <I><FONT color=brown>on</FONT></I>.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Blithe">BLITHE</A>, <A href="entry://Cheerful">CHEERFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote a person who makes decisions in situations in which there is a conflict of views. Judge is the most general term. In its strictest sense, a <B><FONT color=blue>judge</FONT></B> is a government official who presides in a court of law and administers justice by hearing and deciding cases. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>judge</FONT></I> is applied to a person who has the requisite knowledge, experience and impartiality to make decisions or pass upon the merits of something. [Your doctor is the best <I><FONT color=brown>judge</FONT></I> of what will cure your illness; The <I><FONT color=brown>judges</FONT></I> at the show awarded her a blue ribbon for her cake.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Arbitrator</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>arbiter</FONT></B> are sometimes used synonymously to denote a person, or one of several persons, chosen by disputing parties to settle their differences. However, in this sense, arbitrator is the preferred term. [In the labour dispute, three <I><FONT color=brown>arbitrators</FONT></I> were chosen by management and three by the workers.] <I><FONT color=brown>Arbiter</FONT></I>, a somewhat literary word, is more often applied to one who without official authorization or position has the prestige to make decisions or to set standards that others willingly follow. [Lord Chesterfield was the <I><FONT color=brown>arbiter</FONT></I> of elegant manners and good taste in his day; Dress designers are the <I><FONT color=brown>arbiters</FONT></I> of women’s fashions.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Referee</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>umpire</FONT></B> may both mean <I><FONT color=brown>arbitrator</FONT></I>, but the two words are more likely to be used in special contexts. Many sports are presided over by official <I><FONT color=brown>judges</FONT></I> who are appointed to enforce the rules of the game or contest and to settle disputed points. In cricket, tennis, and basketball such an official is called an <I><FONT color=brown>umpire</FONT></I>; in footfall and boxing he is called a <I><FONT color=brown>referee</FONT></I>. Outside the world of sports, <I><FONT color=brown>umpire</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>referee</FONT></I> have further meanings. <I><FONT color=brown>Referee</FONT></I> is applied technically to an expert ?occasionally a lawyer ?to whom a pending legal case is referred, by means of a court order, for additional investigation and report. Although an <I><FONT color=brown>arbitrator</FONT></I>, a legal <I><FONT color=brown>referee</FONT></I> can be appointed without the consent of the parties involved. An <I><FONT color=brown>umpire</FONT></I> may be appointed to make a final decision in a case in which there is disagreement or a stalemate between the <I><FONT color=brown>arbitrators</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>referee</FONT></I> is also a person who supplies a report on personal, academic or other qualifications of an applicant for any position.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lawyer">LAWYER</A>.</P>

jumble

<P>These words are alike in referring to a disordered condition or to a confused or heterogeneous mixture of elements. <B><FONT color=blue>Jumble</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>muddle</FONT></B> both suggest conditions of extreme disorderliness resulting in confusion. <I><FONT color=brown>Jumble</FONT></I> suggests physical disorderliness, a lack of neatness, and brings to mind objects strewn about carelessly: The room was a <I><FONT color=brown>jumble</FONT></I> of books, papers and clothes. <I><FONT color=brown>Muddle</FONT></I> suggests the lack of clear or coherent organization, and commonly refers to mental or intellectual disorder ?confused thinking. [The club records were in a complete <I><FONT color=brown>muddle</FONT></I> ?no one even knew how much money was in the treasury; Income-tax returns always put him in a <I><FONT color=brown>muddle</FONT></I>; in a drunken <I><FONT color=brown>muddle</FONT></I> of misdirected antagonism.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conglomeration</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mélange</FONT></B> refer to heterogeneous collections of things. Both words often carry critical overtones, suggesting that the collection is random or inapposite: a curious <I><FONT color=brown>conglomeration</FONT></I> of witticisms, quotations, word games and other linguistic legerdemain, entertaining enough but lacking any overall plan of organization. <I><FONT color=brown>Mélange</FONT></I> more vigorously suggests inaptness or incongruity, and is sometimes used derisively or contemptuously: a <I><FONT color=brown>mélange</FONT></I> of beatniks, middle-class matrons and television executives. <B><FONT color=blue>Medley</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>farrago</FONT></B> both refer to confused mixtures or masses of elements. <I><FONT color=brown>Medley</FONT></I> emphasizes the variegated, heterogeneous nature of the elements. <I><FONT color=brown>Medley</FONT></I> emphasizes the variegated, heterogeneous nature of the elements that composed it, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>farrago</FONT></I> emphasizes the irrational or confused juxtaposition of those elements. A <I><FONT color=brown>medley</FONT></I> is necessarily various, but not necessarily composed of inharmonious or clashing elements: a <I><FONT color=brown>medley</FONT></I> of flavours; a dance <I><FONT color=brown>medley</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Farrago</FONT></I> strikes a balance somewhere between <I><FONT color=brown>conglomeration</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>mess</FONT></B>: a <I><FONT color=brown>farrago</FONT></I> of outmoded ideas and half-understood theories.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Mess</FONT></I> is the most general word of this set as well as one of the strongest. In the sense here considered it means a hopeless jumble of elements resulting in a state of confusion, or the confused state itself. It may refer either to physical disorder (After the procession ended, the street was a <I><FONT color=brown>mess</FONT></I>), sloppiness or slovenliness (The manuscript was a <I><FONT color=brown>mess</FONT></I>, full of inkblots, erasures and deletions), or to any thoroughly disorganized condition (He’s mad a <I><FONT color=brown>mess</FONT></I> of his life).</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hodge-podge</FONT></B> (or, as it is sometimes spelt and pronounced, <I><FONT color=brown>hotch-potch</FONT></I>), <B><FONT color=blue>potpourri</FONT></B>, and <B><FONT color=blue>olla podrida</FONT></B> all refer in one sense to stews having a variety of ingredients. All commonly refer also to any miscellaneous collection of elements. <I><FONT color=brown>Hodge-podge</FONT></I>, as well as the stronger term <B><FONT color=blue>mish-mash</FONT></B>, emphasizes disorganization; they are the figurative analogues to an actual jumble of objects. [The musical comedy was a <I><FONT color=brown>hodge-podge</FONT></I> of sentimental cliché, coy sexuality and jingoistic claptrap.] <I><FONT color=brown>Hodge-podge</FONT></I> bespeaks a lack of intelligent guidance or rational coherence. <I><FONT color=brown>Mish-mash</FONT></I>, the most directly contemptuous word of this group, is often used to suggest a badly mismanaged or botched undertaking, resulting in confusion and chaos: His heralded new political programme turned out to be nothing more than the usual <I><FONT color=brown>mish-mash</FONT></I> of stale slogans, unrealistic promises and insincere flattery. <I><FONT color=brown>Potpourri</FONT></I>, as here considered, points to the lack of uniformity or similarity of elements, and may imply a lack of discrimination or restraint as well: The film was a <I><FONT color=brown>potpourri</FONT></I> of slapstick, melodrama and bowdlerized history, in spite of which it still managed to include some genuinely funny moments. <I><FONT color=brown>Olla podrida</FONT></I>, borrowed from the Spanish, and <B><FONT color=blue>olio</FONT></B>, derived from <I><FONT color=brown>olla</FONT></I>, are both mainly American, and suggest a miscellaneous collection or medley of elements: an <I><FONT color=brown>olio</FONT></I> of political sentiment, ranging from the radical to the reactionary.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Disparate">DISPARATE</A>, <A href="entry://Heterogeneous">HETEROGENEOUS</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the ability or right to rule. <B><FONT color=blue>Jurisdiction</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words and the most restricted in application. It indicates an officially or legally predetermined division of a larger whole, a division within which someone or something has the right to rule or decide: The Arbitration Court has sole <I><FONT color=brown>jurisdiction</FONT></I> in the determining of industrial awards; the three-nation commission that was given <I><FONT color=brown>jurisdiction</FONT></I> to govern the internationalized city; an advertising manager whose <I><FONT color=brown>jurisdiction</FONT></I> included the company’s public-relations activities. <B><FONT color=blue>Sovereignty</FONT></B> approaches <I><FONT color=brown>jurisdiction</FONT></I> in formality, but it stresses absolute or autonomous rule over something considered as a whole. In this case, the official right to rule is not stressed so much as the fact of actual ruling, however this has come about: British mercantile interests that acquired <I><FONT color=brown>sovereignty</FONT></I> over the scattering of emirates adjacent to the port; nations traditionally suspicious of surrendering the slightest token of <I><FONT color=brown>sovereignty</FONT></I> to any supranational governing body; American revolutionaries who rejected England’s claim of <I><FONT color=brown>sovereignty</FONT></I> over the colonies.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dominion</FONT></B> is less clear-cut in its implications. It can refer, on one hand, to assigned partial rule, like <I><FONT color=brown>jurisdiction</FONT></I>: an Act that gave the Department of Civil Aviation <I><FONT color=brown>dominion</FONT></I> over all private and commercial flying activities. On the other hand, it can refer like <I><FONT color=brown>sovereignty</FONT></I> to absolute control, although here it often refers strictly to the control of a superior over an inferior: the inescapable <I><FONT color=brown>dominion</FONT></I> of the rich and educated over the poor and unschooled. As an actual title for a territory, the word can suggest a colony that has gained internal self-rule but whose external affairs still come under the <I><FONT color=brown>sovereignty</FONT></I> of the colonizer: a colony that advanced to the status of a <I><FONT color=brown>dominion</FONT></I> and finally of a full-fledged republic. <B><FONT color=blue>Sway</FONT></B> can now sound old-fashioned; traditionally it has referred to a sphere in which something has absolute control: the succession of European nations that held <I><FONT color=brown>sway</FONT></I> over various portions of Africa; Aristotle held undisputed <I><FONT color=brown>sway</FONT></I> over the thinking of many medieval philosophers. As in the last example, the word is in danger of being taken in the sense of mere influence rather than absolute control; this possibility occurs because of an unrelated meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>sway</FONT></I>: a demagogue able to <I><FONT color=brown>sway</FONT></I> mass audiences to his point of view.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Authority</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>power</FONT></B> are less formal than the other words here and are much more general in application. <I><FONT color=brown>Power</FONT></I> refers to any exercising of control over something, often with a stress on forcefulness or strength: The monarchy won universal recognition of its <I><FONT color=brown>sovereignty</FONT></I> only after the period of its greatest <I><FONT color=brown>power</FONT></I> had begun to fade. Often, the word refers simply to the ability to choose, understand or control: Only man of all the animals has the power to reason. A related use reveals the word at its most general in referring to any sort of mental physical strength or force: a work of great emotional <I><FONT color=brown>power</FONT></I>; brute <I><FONT color=brown>power</FONT></I> used to put down the revolt. <I><FONT color=brown>Authority</FONT></I> can indicate an officially determined right to rule: a committee given <I><FONT color=brown>authority</FONT></I> to rule on the credentials of disputed delegations. But the word can also refer to anyone exercising power, whether assigned to do so or not: a <I><FONT color=brown>power</FONT></I> gap in the new republic that remained until several tribal leaders assumed <I><FONT color=brown>authority</FONT></I> and formed a caretaker government. The word can indicate all sources of <I><FONT color=brown>power</FONT></I> taken as a whole: a child who always rebelled against <I><FONT color=brown>authority</FONT></I>. In related uses, the word can refer to the expert or the definitive: an <I><FONT color=brown>authority</FONT></I> on antique glass; an actor who executed the role with consummate <I><FONT color=brown>authority</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Law">LAW</A>.</P>

<P>The familiar phrase "the heart of the matter" comes pretty close to summing up the meaning of these words. <B><FONT color=blue>Kernel</FONT></B>, originating in an Old English word for corn seed, soon broadened to include any seed or cereal grain within its protective coating, then the edible inner part of a nut, and finally to its metaphorical sense as the central part of anything: The <I><FONT color=brown>kernel</FONT></I> of the problem is in the interpretation of the evidence.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gist</FONT></B> derives ultimately from a Latin word meaning to lie or rest. Its original meaning as a place of rest came to be extended to the ground or foundation on which something lay or by which it could be supported: the <I><FONT color=brown>gist</FONT></I> of an argument; the <I><FONT color=brown>gist</FONT></I> of the prosecution’s case against the accused. The closely related word <B><FONT color=blue>substance</FONT></B> (from the Latin for to stand under or beneath) includes among its numerous meanings the same idea of the essential or central part of anything, of that without which it would lack stability and value. [Faith is the <I><FONT color=brown>substance</FONT></I> of things not seen; There is much <I><FONT color=brown>substance</FONT></I> in the critic’s views of modern art.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crux</FONT></B>, with its reference to the symbolism of the Cross, implies something pivotal, vital and, sometimes, as the word suggests, crucial: The closing of the gulf of Aqaba proved to be the <I><FONT color=brown>crux</FONT></I> of the situation. <B><FONT color=blue>Nub</FONT></B> is an Americanism meaning very much the same as <I><FONT color=brown>gist</FONT></I>, with an informal carry-over to the idea of a point or moral: the <I><FONT color=brown>nub</FONT></I> of the story; The students cannot go far wrong if they get the <I><FONT color=brown>nub</FONT></I> of the idea in their first lesson. <B><FONT color=blue>Essence</FONT></B>, from its scientific meaning of an extract by distillation, and thus the specific product in a reduced form, is very similar to gist and substance, but has some of the sense of necessity and vital nature of <I><FONT color=brown>crux</FONT></I>: The <I><FONT color=brown>essence</FONT></I> of his argument was clouded by the introduction of irrelevancies.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Nucleus</FONT></B>, though it comes from the Latin word for nut, has not, like the related term <I><FONT color=brown>kernel</FONT></I>, acquired currency in a figurative sense. It has been, and still is, largely restricted to technical and scientific fields, where it denotes a central part or point round which other things are gathered, as in a cell, an atom, certain complex chemical compounds and the like. Because the ideas of movement, change and growth have become so closely associated with it, nucleus serves best only where such ideas are implied in the thought expressed: The <I><FONT color=brown>nucleus</FONT></I> of Plato’s philosophy was in his doctrine of the archetype.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Basis">BASIS</A>, <A href="entry://Centre">CENTRE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: periphery.</P>

<P>These words refer to the taking of lives. <B><FONT color=blue>Kill</FONT></B> is the most general word here, applying to any kind of death-dealing activity: a drought that <I><FONT color=brown>killed</FONT></I> our fruit trees; a pesticide to <I><FONT color=brown>kill</FONT></I> thrips; two people <I><FONT color=brown>killed</FONT></I> in a car accident; a madman who threatened to <I><FONT color=brown>kill</FONT></I> me; soldiers <I><FONT color=brown>killed</FONT></I> in action. The word’s very generality allows its use in situations where cause is assigned for other kinds of death: children <I><FONT color=brown>killed</FONT></I> by neglect; the rising number of people <I><FONT color=brown>killed</FONT></I> by heart disease. The word can even apply where no life is actually lost: a veto that <I><FONT color=brown>killed</FONT></I> the bill; their decision to <I><FONT color=brown>kill</FONT></I> the news story after it had appeared in the early edition. <B><FONT color=blue>Murder</FONT></B> refers less ambiguously to the crime in which one person intentionally <I><FONT color=brown>kills</FONT></I> another: He admitted that he had accidentally <I><FONT color=brown>killed</FONT></I> his wife, but denied that he had murdered her in cold blood. Sometimes, the word can refer to a brutal <I><FONT color=brown>killing</FONT></I>, as in war: naked aggression in which one nation set out to <I><FONT color=brown>murder</FONT></I> the citizens of an adjoining state. Hyperbolically, the word can point to the mishandling of anything: expressionless actors who <I><FONT color=brown>murder</FONT></I> their lines.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Assassinate</FONT></B> is a specific form of <I><FONT color=brown>murder</FONT></I> in which someone kills a public figure, usually a political leader, for whatever reason: a dictator who had survived three attempts to <I><FONT color=brown>assassinate</FONT></I> him. <B><FONT color=blue>Execute</FONT></B> can refer to capital punishment that a state exacts in reprisal for certain crimes: <I><FONT color=brown>executed</FONT></I> for treason; The man who <I><FONT color=brown>murdered</FONT></I> his wife was <I><FONT color=brown>executed</FONT></I> on the gallows, according to law. Sometimes the word can refer to an on-the-spot killing of enemies or prisoners by an opponent, as in a war, occupation or insurrection: here, the notion of legal sanction may be absent: the six million <I><FONT color=brown>executed</FONT></I> by the Nazis; a brigand who ordered his captives <I><FONT color=brown>executed</FONT></I> by firing squad. <B><FONT color=blue>Dispatch</FONT></B> can function like <I><FONT color=brown>execute</FONT></I> in reference to official case, the word stresses efficiency and swiftness: The emperor ordered him <I><FONT color=brown>executed</FONT></I> by slow torture, rather than allowing him to be mercifully <I><FONT color=brown>dispatched</FONT></I> on the battlefield; the Reign of Terror during which hundreds were daily <I><FONT color=brown>dispatched</FONT></I> by the guillotine. The word can also indicate the death stroke itself: a pistol with which to <I><FONT color=brown>dispatch</FONT></I> those not <I><FONT color=brown>killed</FONT></I> by the firing squad’s volley.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Butcher</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>slaughter</FONT></B> can both refer to the killing of animals for food. <I><FONT color=brown>Slaughter</FONT></I> is the preferred term in the meat industry, possibly because <I><FONT color=brown>butcher</FONT></I> has implications of brutality or because <I><FONT color=brown>butcher</FONT></I> can also apply to the cutting or carving of meat at any point after the actual <I><FONT color=brown>killing</FONT></I>. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>butcher</FONT></I> usually indicates a small-scale operation, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>slaughter</FONT></I> can better suggest mass <I><FONT color=brown>killing</FONT></I> as well: a shed in which the farmer butchered livestock to feed his own family; legislation to control the <I><FONT color=brown>slaughtering</FONT></I> of cattle in abattoirs. Both words take on extremely disapproving overtones when applied to the <I><FONT color=brown>killing</FONT></I> of people. <I><FONT color=brown>Butcher</FONT></I> here suggests bungling inexpertness or sadistic brutality: a rapist who had <I><FONT color=brown>butchered</FONT></I> his victim with a razor; dictators who <I><FONT color=brown>butcher</FONT></I> those foolish enough to dissent. <I><FONT color=brown>Slaughter</FONT></I> specifically suggests the <I><FONT color=brown>killing</FONT></I> of great numbers of people: Teutonic hordes who advanced across Europe, sacking and <I><FONT color=brown>slaughtering</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Massacre</FONT></B> usually applies solely to the brutal <I><FONT color=brown>killing</FONT></I> of large numbers of people. In this, it is close to one aspect of slaughter, but it is more specific in suggesting the wholesale and often total destruction of a group of relatively defenceless people by another, as in war, persecution or revenge: the Incas who were <I><FONT color=brown>massacred</FONT></I> by the Spaniards; Herod ordered all infants in the land to be <I><FONT color=brown>massacred</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Slay</FONT></B> can now sound outdated as a close synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>murder</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>slaughter</FONT></I> except in Biblical reference. [David slew Goliath; Charioteers were sent to <I><FONT color=brown>slay</FONT></I> the escaping Jews.] But brevity has given the word currency in newspaper headlines: Underworld leader <I><FONT color=brown>slain</FONT></I>. The past participle, in fact, is now more frequently used than other forms of the verb a battle in which twenty were <I><FONT color=brown>slain</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, <A href="entry://Die">DIE</A>, <A href="entry://Erase">ERASE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the people connected to one by blood or marriage. <B><FONT color=blue>Kin</FONT></B> is a general word for such people but is now somewhat archaic, except in phrases like <I><FONT color=brown>next-of-kin</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Relatives</FONT></B> is the common term, for which <B><FONT color=blue>relations</FONT></B> can substitute ?especially as the word of choice to indicate humorous or serious disparagement of the people to whom one is related. When used, <I><FONT color=brown>kin</FONT></I> is more likely to concentrate on blood relationship, whereas the other two are wider in scope by including in-laws as well. <I><FONT color=brown>Kin</FONT></I> is always construed as plural.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Family</FONT></B> is a much more restricted term, referring only to one’s closest blood <I><FONT color=brown>relatives</FONT></I>, usually to those people actually living together in one household: a <I><FONT color=brown>family</FONT></I> composed of mother, father, one grandfather, and three children. The word can apply more widely to those people, past and present, bearing the same <I><FONT color=brown>family</FONT></I> name: a distinguished British <I><FONT color=brown>family</FONT></I> over three generations. <B><FONT color=blue>Kinsmen</FONT></B> often points to this same idea: He brilliantly upheld the honour of a long line of <I><FONT color=brown>kinsmen</FONT></I>. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>kin</FONT></I>, the word has a singular form: a <I><FONT color=brown>kinsman</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>kinswoman</FONT></I>) of mine. <B><FONT color=blue>Kindred</FONT></B> can refer to <I><FONT color=brown>relatives</FONT></I>, to lineage, or to a looser fraternal or tribal group: a clan in which the <I><FONT color=brown>kindred</FONT></I> are loyal to the same totem.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Kinfolk</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>kinfolks</FONT></B> are informal version of <B><FONT color=blue>kinsfolk</FONT></B> which, like <I><FONT color=brown>kin</FONT></I>, appears preponderantly in the U.S. South and has no singular form. The word suggests a good many <I><FONT color=brown>relatives</FONT></I> who keep in touch or who act together, as in a clan.

kind
<B><FONT color=blue>kind</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>category</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sort</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>type</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to groupings of similar things. <B><FONT color=blue>Kind</FONT></B> can indicate a grouping that has indisputable objective reality: a poker hand that contained four of a <I><FONT color=brown>kind</FONT></I>. More informally, it can also indicate a subjective notion on the part of a speaker that two or more things are alike in some way: I don’t like people of that <I><FONT color=brown>kind</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>kind</FONT></I> of room that I can feel at home in. often the word can be used when no very serious reference to a larger grouping is actually intended: He was a friendly <I><FONT color=brown>kind</FONT></I> of person. <B><FONT color=blue>Sort</FONT></B> is even more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>kind</FONT></I>. Occasionally, it can refer to clearly defined groupings that are objectively valid: a list of the <I><FONT color=brown>sorts</FONT></I> of tree that are hardy enough to grow in cities, despite the hazard of air pollution. But even more often than <I><FONT color=brown>kind</FONT></I>, the word suggests a subjective evaluation. Furthermore, the word more often indicates a negative judgement: the wrong <I><FONT color=brown>sort</FONT></I> of person for her son to be associating with.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Type</FONT></B> is only slightly more formal than the foregoing, but it points more clearly to objectively definable groupings: the four basic <I><FONT color=brown>types</FONT></I> of blood; <I><FONT color=brown>types</FONT></I> of world literature. But it can be used in the same indefinite way as <I><FONT color=brown>kind</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>sort</FONT></I>, although it may carry over a note of greater conviction: What an ugly <I><FONT color=brown>type</FONT></I> of building. A special use of the word refers to an individual or example as though it were the quintessence of a whole group: He was an Air Force <I><FONT color=brown>type</FONT></I>; a beatnik <I><FONT color=brown>type</FONT></I>. Some careful writers avoid this informal usage ?or any use of the preceding words that suggests the existence of hard-and-fast classifications where this is not the case. <B><FONT color=blue>Category</FONT></B>, the most formal of these words, applies exclusively to definable grouping, whether they are arbitrarily developed for the sake of order or convenience: self-evident <I><FONT color=brown>categories</FONT></I> based on the results of a single chemical test; She made <I><FONT color=brown>categories</FONT></I> of the things she wanted to take with her, things she wanted put into storage, and things to be discarded.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Class">CLASS</A>, <A href="entry://Prototype">PROTOTYPE</A>.</P>

<P>These words relate to various ways in which something can be set on fire or made to burn, literally to figuratively. <B><FONT color=blue>Kindle</FONT></B> suggests the need for some preparatory effort or action before combustible material will start to burn. [He <I><FONT color=brown>kindled</FONT></I> a fire by setting a match to the sticks; A smouldering cigarette can <I><FONT color=brown>kindle</FONT></I> a devastating bushfire.] In reference to people, the word indicates the act of arousing, stimulating or exciting. [The boy’s interest in science was <I><FONT color=brown>kindled</FONT></I> by his visit to the laboratory; The speaker’s eloquence <I><FONT color=brown>kindled</FONT></I> a lively enthusiasm in the audience.]</P><P>In the sense of burning or applying great heat, <B><FONT color=blue>fire</FONT></B> has numerous applications, both technical and figurative. One can <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I> a furnace, <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I> a gun, <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I> the pottery in a kiln, <I><FONT color=brown>fire</FONT></I> a haystack. Metaphorically, it can have much the same meaning as <I><FONT color=brown>kindle</FONT></I>, but with the suggestion of a sudden burst. [His imagination was <I><FONT color=brown>fired</FONT></I> by what he had read; The coach <I><FONT color=brown>fired</FONT></I> the team with a determination to win the premiership.] This compares with an analogous, chiefly literary use of the word <B><FONT color=blue>inflame</FONT></B> to mean exciting to violent emotion or activity; The crowd was <I><FONT color=brown>inflamed</FONT></I> by the brutality of the police. In medical usage, however the word denotes a condition of actual heat, swelling and soreness in some part of the body: an <I><FONT color=brown>inflamed</FONT></I> ulcer, complicated by infection.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ignite</FONT></B> is almost entirely restricted to the technical sense of a rapid and sometimes violent burning of something that has been exposed to a critical temperature by one means or another. [An electric spark <I><FONT color=brown>ignites</FONT></I> the petrol in a car engine; A time fuse <I><FONT color=brown>ignited</FONT></I> the light explosives; Spontaneous combustion <I><FONT color=brown>ignited</FONT></I> the heap of oil-soaked rags in the basement.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Light</FONT></B> has a double reference both to heat and to illumination. One can speak of <I><FONT color=brown>lighting</FONT></I> a fire or a furnace and of <I><FONT color=brown>lighting</FONT></I> a lamp, with the knowledge that one result more or less accompanies the other, as when an electric current <I><FONT color=brown>ignites</FONT></I> the filament in an evacuated glass bulb, making it glow brightly.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bright">BRIGHT</A>, <A href="entry://Burn">BURN</A>, <A href="entry://Fire">FIRE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: darken, extinguish, quench, smother, stifle.</P>

<P>These words all describe sharpened or pointed instruments commonly set in handles. <B><FONT color=blue>Knife</FONT></B> is the general term for any instrument used for cutting, piercing or spreading, with one or more sharpened edges, and sometimes with pointed blades. A <I><FONT color=brown>knife</FONT></I>, though it may be used as a weapon, is no more essentially a weapon than is a paperweight or a pair of shears, which can also be formidable weapons. For a <I><FONT color=brown>knife</FONT></I> used as a weapon, American criminals have long had a word, variously spelt but now generally rendered <B><FONT color=blue>shiv</FONT></B>.

<P>These words mean to form a fabric from threads or other strands by various methods. <B><FONT color=blue>Knit</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>crochet</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tat</FONT></B> are closely related in that all imply the drawing of a single strand of yearn, cotton, silk, etc., into series of interlocking loops. <I><FONT color=brown>Knitting</FONT></I> involves the use of two large, slightly pointed needles (for a <I><FONT color=brown>knitting</FONT></I> machine) on which a series of interlacing loops are made into successive rows, the fabric being transferred to alternate needles at the beginning of each new row of stitches. <I><FONT color=brown>Crocheting</FONT></I> is a type of <I><FONT color=brown>knitting</FONT></I>, but it is done with a single needle having a hook at one end. Unlike the stitches of <I><FONT color=brown>knitting</FONT></I>, those of crocheting are not necessarily made in successive rows. Both <I><FONT color=brown>knit</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>crochet</FONT></I> nearly always imply the direct construction of a garment or other article: to <I><FONT color=brown>knit</FONT></I> a sweater; to <I><FONT color=brown>crochet</FONT></I> a bedspread. <I><FONT color=brown>Tat</FONT></I> implies the making of an edging, as for a handkerchief, by means of a small hand shuttle that knots and loops a single thread into a lacelike strip that resembles <I><FONT color=brown>crochet</FONT></I> work.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Weave</FONT></B> differs completely in principle from <I><FONT color=brown>knit</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>crochet</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>tat</FONT></I>. In <I><FONT color=brown>weaving</FONT></I> fabric, threads are entwined into a texture by interlacing on a loom two sets of strands, the warp and the weft (sometimes called woof) that are at right angles to each other.

<P>These words have to do with indicating the nature, function, purpose, disposition, etc. of anything that requires special identification, usually in the form of written or printed instructions, but also verbally or by position. At its most limited, <B><FONT color=blue>label</FONT></B> can indicate the affixing of a slip that contains a printed, written or visual legend. In this context, <B><FONT color=blue>tag</FONT></B> indicates one form of <I><FONT color=brown>labelling</FONT></I> in which such a legend is tied or strung to something by means of cord or wire: government regulations for <I><FONT color=brown>labelling</FONT></I> tinned goods; certain packages that must be <I><FONT color=brown>tagged</FONT></I> as well as labelled. <I><FONT color=brown>Tag</FONT></I> might also better suggest a symbolic identification rather than a detailing of information: <I><FONT color=brown>tagging</FONT></I> the diseased sheep with a red marker and healthy ones with a green marker. Used more generally, <I><FONT color=brown>label</FONT></I> has the wider range of application for any act of identifying something: a professor who was <I><FONT color=brown>labelled</FONT></I> by the students as a tiresome bore. As in this example, the word can be humorous or sarcastic, but often it points disapprovingly to unfair identifications: those who label as communistic anyone interested in social welfare. With fewer general applications, <I><FONT color=brown>tag</FONT></I> can suggest a looser identification: He was <I><FONT color=brown>tagged</FONT></I> by some as a miser and by others as a prudent man. The word may be merely a more vivid or colourful substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>label</FONT></I>: a professor who was <I><FONT color=brown>tagged</FONT></I> as a silly old bore.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Categorize</FONT></B> is the most formal and neutral word here; it applies to the classification of something within a larger system or division: an explanation of how books are <I><FONT color=brown>categorized</FONT></I> under the Dewey Decimal System. Because of its earlier and still active use in philosophy and logic, the word can indicate an arrangement that is both imperative and final, but, just as often, <I><FONT color=brown>categorize</FONT></I> can point to any arbitrary arrangement adopted for convenience in handling large masses of data or detail. <B><FONT color=blue>Pigeonhole</FONT></B> suggests the same idea, but is often used, like one sense of label, to indicate disapproval for an attempt to fit something, in all its complexity, into simple and preconceived stereotypes: They were more concerned to <I><FONT color=brown>pigeonhole</FONT></I> a patient as a manic-depressive, schizophrenic or what-have-you than to treat his individual illness. The word may also apply to the filing away of something to be dealt with later or forgotten: he <I><FONT color=brown>pigeonholed</FONT></I> all proposals for changing the work schedules.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Kind">KIND</A>, <A href="entry://Organize">ORGANIZE</A>.</P>

The word also refers to a working force, whether unionized or not: a meeting between <I><FONT color=brown>labour</FONT></I> and management. An older sense of the word refers to childbirth: attended by a nurse during <I><FONT color=brown>labour</FONT></I>. The word can refer to strictly mental effort, in which case it suggests unusual difficulty: weeks of <I><FONT color=brown>labour</FONT></I> to get the accounts to balance; the gruelling <I><FONT color=brown>labour</FONT></I> he put in on his master’s thesis. <B><FONT color=blue>Work</FONT></B> can apply to any situation in which either a short-term or recurring task is performed: It took hard <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> to get the car out of the rutted street; depressions that throw thousands out of <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I>. In a related use, the word can apply to the result of someone’s <I><FONT color=brown>labours</FONT></I>: his life’s <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I>; a book that was the <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> of a distinguished group of scholars. It can also apply to something, as machinery, designed for a special function; this usually requires the plural: water<I><FONT color=brown>works</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>works</FONT></I> of a clock.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Toil</FONT></B> emphasizes the difficulty of the <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> it pertains to, but it is less often used now except for a high-toned effect, possibly specious: the <I><FONT color=brown>toil</FONT></I> of our forefathers to build a stronger nation; mothers whose <I><FONT color=brown>toil</FONT></I> to better their children often goes unrewarded. <B><FONT color=blue>Yakka</FONT></B> (also spelt <I><FONT color=brown>yakker</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>yacker</FONT></I>) is an Australian slang term for <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>toil</FONT></I>, usually being limited to that demanding physical energy: Cane-cutting is hard yakka. <I><FONT color=brown>Travail</FONT></I> emphasizes actual suffering, mainly because of its reference, like <I><FONT color=brown>labour</FONT></I>, to the pains of childbirth. <B><FONT color=blue>Travail</FONT></B> is, however, distinctly precious in sound and pseudo-poetical even in reference to childbirth, where the greater simplicity of labour gives both strength and dignity. In some contexts, particularly metaphorical, the word may nonetheless be useful: still unenlightened about the futility of war after centuries of <I><FONT color=brown>travail</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Drudgery</FONT></B> emphasize <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> that is uninspiring, unpleasant or arduous; it may suggest physical <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> on a menial level, but can apply to any dull and unrewarding task. Unlike some other words here, <I><FONT color=brown>drudgery</FONT></I> need not suggest hard or exhausting <I><FONT color=brown>labour</FONT></I> so much as unrelieved monotony: machines to take much of the <I><FONT color=brown>drudgery</FONT></I> out of manual <I><FONT color=brown>labour</FONT></I>; the unrelenting <I><FONT color=brown>drudgery</FONT></I> of exam week. <B><FONT color=blue>Grind</FONT></B> is in some ways an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>drudgery</FONT></I>, but it particularly emphasizes <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> done under pressure in a dehumanizing routine way, whether physical or mental; it suggests the never-ending and unrelenting quality of such <I><FONT color=brown>labour</FONT></I> done over a long period of time: the twelve-hour <I><FONT color=brown>grind</FONT></I> of coal miners at the turn of the century; the daily <I><FONT color=brown>grind</FONT></I> of the office worker.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Effort">EFFORT</A>, <A href="entry://Profession">PROFESSION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: idleness, leisure, <A href="entry://Pleasure">PLEASURE</A>, relaxation.</P>

<P>These words refer to those who earn their living by physical effort, or by the practice of relatively simply skills. <B><FONT color=blue>Labourer</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>worker</FONT></B> are the most factual of these, with the least emotional tinge of one sort or another. <I><FONT color=brown>Labourer</FONT></I> specifically emphasizes physical effort while worker in more general in applying to a wider range of tasks and reaching higher up the ladder of skills. [Automation hits hardest at the completely unskilled <I><FONT color=brown>labourer</FONT></I>, next at the skilled tradesman, and last at the white-collar <I><FONT color=brown>worker</FONT></I>.] By contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>worker</FONT></I>, however, <B><FONT color=blue>working man</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>workman</FONT></B> have a narrower or more specific range of application, working man particularly being applicable at most to semi-skilled labour: the limited saving power of the average <I><FONT color=brown>working man</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Workman</FONT></I>, when it is not an abbreviated form of <I><FONT color=brown>working man</FONT></I>, can suggest the possession of skills approaching that of the craftsman: <I><FONT color=brown>workmen</FONT></I> who restored and refinished her parquet floors.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Job holder</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wage earner</FONT></B> are both ways of stressing the money a <I><FONT color=brown>labourer</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>worker</FONT></I> earns and the fact that he is, at the moment of description, actually employed, that is, holding a job or earning wages. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>job holder</FONT></I> can apply more generally, since it stresses being in a position of employment more than the position itself, which could range from unskilled to skilled work. <I><FONT color=brown>Wage earner</FONT></I> distinguishes between someone who gets a pay enveloped and someone who is self-employed.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Proletarian</FONT></B> originally denoted a member of the lowest class of the state in ancient Rome, who owned no property. The term got a new lease on life from modern political and economic theorists, particularly Karl Marx, who used it to designate that class of a state or of the world which, lacking personal means of production, is forced to sell its labour for wages in order to live.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artisan">ARTISAN</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>lack</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>absence</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>dearth</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>shortage</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all denote a deficiency or non-existence of something specified or implied. <B><FONT color=blue>Lack</FONT></B> is a general term which means a total or partial insufficiency. [It was a <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> of cash that prevented me from joining you at lunch today; A <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> of bedding in the weekender meant that three of us had to sleep on the floor.] Although <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> by itself can express a totality of deficiency, a qualifying adjective is often used with it to avoid any possibility of confusion: The young man displayed a complete <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> of courtesy and tact in dealing with his employer. No confusion about total <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> is possible when <B><FONT color=blue>absence</FONT></B> is used alone. <I><FONT color=brown>Absence</FONT></I> is the opposite of presence; it means non-existence: The <I><FONT color=brown>absence</FONT></I> of a chairman turned the meeting into a near riot. The difference between <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>absence</FONT></I> is apparent when we contrast "a <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> of sugar in her diet" with "an <I><FONT color=brown>absence</FONT></I> of sugar in her diet." The former suggests that there is some sugar in the diet but not enough; the latter implies that there is no sugar at all in the diet. <I><FONT color=brown>Absence</FONT></I>, of course, can also signify the state of being away. In the example cited, "the <I><FONT color=brown>absence</FONT></I> of chairman" denotes the non-existence of a chairman. If the phrase were "in the <I><FONT color=brown>absence</FONT></I> of the chairman," it would be obvious that a chairman existed but was away at the time under discussion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shortage</FONT></B> is synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> in designating a partial insufficiency, but more than <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> it suggests an insufficiency of some established, required or accustomed amount: There was a <I><FONT color=brown>shortage</FONT></I> of bottled beer last week because of a delivery strike. <I><FONT color=brown>Shortage</FONT></I> also means the amount by which something is deficient: The total <I><FONT color=brown>shortage</FONT></I> amounted to $500.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dearth</FONT></B>, in a sense no longer used, meant dearness or costliness. It came later to refer to the kind of <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> or scarcity which makes something costly, especially food in time of famine. An extension of this sense gives <I><FONT color=brown>dearth</FONT></I> the meaning of a <I><FONT color=brown>lack</FONT></I> or scarcity of anything: a <I><FONT color=brown>dearth</FONT></I> of content in an essay; a <I><FONT color=brown>dearth</FONT></I> of oranges because of drought conditions; a <I><FONT color=brown>dearth</FONT></I> of parental affection and discipline.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Require">REQUIRE</A>, <A href="entry://Scanty">SCANTY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: abundance, adequacy, </P>

<P>These words refer to partial or complete disablement, particularly of the legs or feet. <B><FONT color=blue>Lame</FONT></B> can refer to such impairment in a man or animal. It perhaps most often suggests a gradually worsening disablement or stiffening as from old age or arthritis. In many cases, walking might still be possible, though difficult: the <I><FONT color=brown>lame</FONT></I> old man who used a cane to get about; a horse that had gone <I><FONT color=brown>lame</FONT></I> in one hind leg and had to be shot. The word can also refer to other impairments, especially involving muscular soreness or inflammation: a <I><FONT color=brown>lame</FONT></I> back that made sitting up straight excruciating. More generally, the word can indicate something poor or awkward: a <I><FONT color=brown>lame</FONT></I> excuse. The rather old-fashioned word <B><FONT color=blue>game</FONT></B> has given us also the informal word <B><FONT color=blue>gammy</FONT></B>. Both mean <I><FONT color=brown>lame</FONT></I> in the physical sense but usually qualify some part of the body: The accident left him with a <I><FONT color=brown>game</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>gammy</FONT></I>) leg.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crippled</FONT></B> is now more often used to suggest an accidental impairment: left permanently <I><FONT color=brown>crippled</FONT></I> by the collision. Also, the word can more often suggest total loss of movement: telling the <I><FONT color=brown>crippled</FONT></I> man he would never regain the use of either leg. While the word is, thus, more forceful than <I><FONT color=brown>lame</FONT></I>, it can be used for milder impairments, as well: hands <I><FONT color=brown>crippled</FONT></I> by rheumatism: a <I><FONT color=brown>crippled</FONT></I> woman who could walk by means of braces attached to her legs. <B><FONT color=blue>Halt</FONT></B> is now archaic sounding when used of a person who is <I><FONT color=brown>lame</FONT></I> or walks with a limp, except in stock phrases: a beggar who was both <I><FONT color=brown>halt</FONT></I> and blind.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hamstrung</FONT></B> pertains most directly to animals when the Achilles tendons of their hind legs have been purposely cut to make them incapable of walking: mounted police whose horses were <I><FONT color=brown>hamstrung</FONT></I> by the rioters. The word can also refer to the same condition in people, usually accidental: a torn ligament that left the star hurdler <I><FONT color=brown>hamstrung</FONT></I>. More commonly the word refers to any frustrating setback: office procedure <I><FONT color=brown>hamstrung</FONT></I> by bureaucratic complexity. <I><FONT color=brown>Crippled</FONT></I> can also be used in a comparable way: a housing programme <I><FONT color=brown>crippled</FONT></I> by cutbacks in the budget. <B><FONT color=blue>Hobbled</FONT></B> can indicate a less drastic way of impeding the movement of horses ?in which legs are tied so as to permit walking but not running or galloping: horses <I><FONT color=brown>hobbled</FONT></I> on the outskirts of the camp. Metaphorically, the word also suggests reduced activity caused by some frustrating factor: a bill <I><FONT color=brown>hobbled</FONT></I> in committee by obstructionist amendments.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hurt">HURT</A>, <A href="entry://Powerless">POWERLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Weak">WEAK</A>.</P>

<P>These adjectives apply to leanness that is emphasized by height, length of limb, or awkwardness of bearing. A <B><FONT color=blue>lanky</FONT></B> person is tall, thin and long-limbed, being typically loose-jointed: a tall, <I><FONT color=brown>lanky</FONT></I> fellow; a <I><FONT color=brown>lanky</FONT></I> basketball player. <B><FONT color=blue>Gangling</FONT></B> is closely synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>lanky</FONT></I> but implies greater awkwardness, as from disproportionate growth of the limbs during adolescence: a <I><FONT color=brown>gangling</FONT></I>, ungainly girl, all arms and legs. [He hurried towards me with long, <I><FONT color=brown>gangling</FONT></I> strides.] <B><FONT color=blue>Rangy</FONT></B> carries no hint of gracelessness but stresses build. It was originally applied to animals having lengthy bodies and long limbs and therefore well adapted for roving: <I><FONT color=brown>rangy</FONT></I> cattle. Now it is also used of slim and long-legged human beings: a <I><FONT color=brown>rangy</FONT></I> stockman; <I><FONT color=brown>rangy</FONT></I> runners in an athletic team.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Angular</FONT></B> presupposes prominent bones and suggests sharp edges: <I><FONT color=brown>angular</FONT></I> features; an <I><FONT color=brown>angular</FONT></I> adolescent. Along with bony leanness, it often indicates unprepossessing stiffness ?whether evinced in awkward, jerky movements or in an unbending manner. Hence, when <I><FONT color=brown>angular</FONT></I> is applied to tall, thin females, it signals the absence of such womanly attributes as roundness, softness, pliancy and grace: an <I><FONT color=brown>angular</FONT></I> headmistress with a cold eye and forbidding aspect. <B><FONT color=blue>Raw-boned</FONT></B> is usually used of men and emphasizes a big, bony, often awkward frame. A <I><FONT color=brown>raw-boned</FONT></I> person has a prominent bone structure and little flesh, but may be sturdily made though spare and <I><FONT color=brown>angular</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Row-boned</FONT></I> carries the suggestion of crudity in build, of sharp or knobby bones jutting out: a ruddy, <I><FONT color=brown>row-boned</FONT></I> recruit.</P><P>The last two adjectives focus on abnormal leanness rather than a naturally lanky or bony build. <B><FONT color=blue>Spindling</FONT></B> describes a form that is so long and thin, so very slender, that it seems markedly out of proportion: The old man looked like an apparition ?a tall, <I><FONT color=brown>spindling</FONT></I> wraith. <B><FONT color=blue>Spindly</FONT></B> adds to <I><FONT color=brown>spindling</FONT></I> the suggestion of physical weakness and frailty, describing a combination of height or length and matchstick thinness: a <I><FONT color=brown>spindly</FONT></I> invalid, pitifully wasted away; a child unable to stand on his <I><FONT color=brown>spindly</FONT></I> little legs. <I><FONT color=brown>Spindly</FONT></I> may also be used of a fragile, limblike, appendage of a machine: the <I><FONT color=brown>spindly</FONT></I>, aluminium legs of the spacecraft.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bony">BONY</A>, <A href="entry://Clumsy">CLUMSY</A>, <A href="entry://Thin">THIN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Fat">FAT</A>, <A href="entry://Husky">HUSKY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things of more than normal size or to things of unusual mass. <B><FONT color=blue>Large</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>big</FONT></B> are both very general and very vague; both are acceptable in contexts ranging from the most informal to the most formal, although <I><FONT color=brown>large</FONT></I> would tend to be substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>big</FONT></I> in extremely formal contexts. <I><FONT color=brown>Big</FONT></I> suggests something of more than normal size, but it is particularly relevant to material or bodily mass, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>large</FONT></I> might suggest even greater departure from a norm. In this case, the word’s implications are less limited to the physical: a <I><FONT color=brown>big</FONT></I> stone; a <I><FONT color=brown>big</FONT></I> bully; a <I><FONT color=brown>large</FONT></I> house; trying on a <I><FONT color=brown>larger</FONT></I> size shoe; the <I><FONT color=brown>large</FONT></I> issues confronting us.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Outsize</FONT></B> (or its variant, <I><FONT color=brown>outsized</FONT></I>) specifically suggests something that is too <I><FONT color=brown>large</FONT></I> to conform to the norm or be accommodated by an already established measure. While the word thus suggests an object of abnormal or excessive size, unusual mass is not necessarily implied by the word: outsize typing paper that wouldn’t fit the binder in which she kept the other reports; extra-<I><FONT color=brown>large</FONT></I> beds for <I><FONT color=brown>outsize</FONT></I> people. <B><FONT color=blue>King-size</FONT></B> (or its variant, <I><FONT color=brown>king-sized</FONT></I>) is merchandising term that refers to a product that is longer or larger than the standard or usual size: <I><FONT color=brown>king-size</FONT></I> cigarettes; <I><FONT color=brown>king-size</FONT></I> beds. The use of such terminology in packaging and advertising is very prevalent, probably because it is more deceptive about value than it is informative about size.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gigantic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mammoth</FONT></B> are now mostly used as hyperboles, suggesting anything of extreme proportions. <I><FONT color=brown>Gigantic</FONT></I> derives from a word for giant; <I><FONT color=brown>mammoth</FONT></I>, of course, can refer to the prehistoric elephantlike animal. <I><FONT color=brown>Mammoth</FONT></I> in this context still may more readily suggest something physically big, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>gigantic</FONT></I> is more often used now for metaphorical instances: a <I><FONT color=brown>mammoth</FONT></I> skyscraper; a <I><FONT color=brown>gigantic</FONT></I> threat to our security. But this is by no means invariable: a <I><FONT color=brown>mammoth</FONT></I> weekend party; a <I><FONT color=brown>gigantic</FONT></I> brute of a man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Giant</FONT></B> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>gigantic</FONT></I> in often suggesting a physical change of scale or in referring to something reproduced in outsized dimensions: a science-fiction story about <I><FONT color=brown>giant</FONT></I> cockroaches. As a mere hyperbole, it can be used indiscriminately: a <I><FONT color=brown>giant</FONT></I> protest rally. In this example, reference to a <I><FONT color=brown>large</FONT></I> rally is no doubt intended, rather than to one made up of disgruntled <I><FONT color=brown>giants</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Massive">MASSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Size">SIZE</A>, <A href="entry://Tremendous">TREMENDOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Minute">MINUTE</A>, <A href="entry://Small">SMALL</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Laugh</FONT></B>, the most general term of this group, describes the inarticulate, more or less explosive sounds that people make for a variety of reasons. The usual reasons given are merriment, joy and happiness, but every school child knows that laughter is used also to conceal shyness, nervousness or intimidation, and as a device to humiliate, deride or ridicule. Indeed, because laughter is provoked by so many different situations, a number of words are necessary to describe the different kinds of laughter characteristic of different situations.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Giggle</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>titters</FONT></B> denote high-pitched sounds and are usually associated with children or girls. A <I><FONT color=brown>titter</FONT></I> is somewhat breathless, as from childish embarrassment or shyness. Schoolgirls typically <I><FONT color=brown>titter</FONT></I> over any allusion to sex; perhaps this use by writers is influenced by the unrelated word titillate, meaning to excite or cause a tickling sensation in. <I><FONT color=brown>Giggle</FONT></I>, though used in similar contexts, is broader in application; it often conveys an uncontrollable fit of silly but harmless laughter ?thus the colloquial expression "to get the <I><FONT color=brown>giggles</FONT></I>." One sometimes hears middle-aged or elderly women spoken of as <I><FONT color=brown>giggling</FONT></I>, just as one sometimes hears them referred to as "girls." Such uses tend to strike others as used to describe derisive laughter. [When the teacher turned his back, Johnny yelled "Hee, haw!" and the class <I><FONT color=brown>tittered</FONT></I>; the children <I><FONT color=brown>giggled</FONT></I> at the clown’s antics; The girls couldn’t stop <I><FONT color=brown>giggling</FONT></I> when the boy answered that Don Bradman was a famous tennis player.] Both words are onomatopoeic in origin; a <I><FONT color=brown>giggle</FONT></I> is more fluid and less breathless than the staccato <I><FONT color=brown>titter</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Snicker</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>snigger</FONT></B> describe smothered or half-suppressed laughter used in derision, and, while not restricted to children, they imply a juvenile temperament and a decidedly retarded if not perverted sense of humour. [The boys <I><FONT color=brown>snickered</FONT></I> as the poor dog ran about with a tin can tied to its tail; They <I><FONT color=brown>sniggered</FONT></I> when he announced that he would someday be Prime Minister.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chuckle</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>chortle</FONT></B> denote quiet laughter, usually harmless, pleasant and good-natured in tone. <I><FONT color=brown>Chuckles</FONT></I> are generally low-keyed, reflective and masculine, express satisfaction or appreciation, and are often directed at the <I><FONT color=brown>chuckler</FONT></I> himself. [He <I><FONT color=brown>chuckled</FONT></I> at himself for having worn two socks that didn’t match; He couldn’t help <I><FONT color=brown>chuckling</FONT></I> when his little boy called the Manly ferry the Manly fairy.] <I><FONT color=brown>Chortle</FONT></I>, coined from <I><FONT color=brown>chuckle</FONT></I> and snort by Lewis Carroll in <I><FONT color=brown>Through the Looking-Glass</FONT></I>, has a suggestion of high glee or impishness that is lacking in <I><FONT color=brown>chuckle</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Guffaw</FONT></B> is a loud, hearty, spontaneous roar of laughter, commonly associated with men. It is harmless and good-natured in tone, but rather gruff and rude in quality.

<P>These words all denote rules of conduct or procedure which are imposed by some authority. <B><FONT color=blue>Law</FONT></B> is the broadest and most general term in this group. It designates a rule of conduct recognized by custom or decreed by formal enactment and considered by a community, nation or other authoritatively constituted group as binding upon its members.

An act of Parliament would be considered a <I><FONT color=brown>statute</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>by-law</FONT></B> or an <B><FONT color=blue>ordinance</FONT></B> is a <I><FONT color=brown>statute</FONT></I> enacted by a municipal body; such <I><FONT color=brown>laws</FONT></I> cover local problems pertaining to zoning, sanitation, parking and the like. Government instrumentalities also may frame <I><FONT color=brown>by-laws</FONT></I> controlling public usage of facilities: prosecuted under a Railway Department <I><FONT color=brown>by-law</FONT></I> for wilfully damaging a carriage seat.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Regulation</FONT></B> is a general and less formal word than the others in this group.

<P>These words are different ways of indicating what is permitted, allowable, countenanced or sanctioned by custom or by some recognized authority.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lawful</FONT></B> implies conformity with laws, statutes, canons, precepts, principles, rules, etc. intended to regulate the conduct of those coming within their particular field of action. Thus one speaks of <I><FONT color=brown>lawful</FONT></I> debts, a <I><FONT color=brown>lawful</FONT></I> claim, a <I><FONT color=brown>lawful</FONT></I> marriage, of conducting a <I><FONT color=brown>lawful</FONT></I> business or making a <I><FONT color=brown>lawful</FONT></I> decision. <B><FONT color=blue>Legal</FONT></B> has nearly the same meaning, but is restricted chiefly to statute laws as they apply at certain times and places or under prescribed conditions. [Divorce is <I><FONT color=brown>lawful</FONT></I> but subject to various <I><FONT color=brown>legal</FONT></I> requirements before taking final effect; the <I><FONT color=brown>legal</FONT></I> speed limit within the city is 35 miles per hour.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Constitutional</FONT></B> refers tot he fundamental laws and principles that have been formally adopted to govern the efficient operations of a state acting as a unit towards those subject to its control, and in its dealings with other states. [He stood on his <I><FONT color=brown>constitutional</FONT></I> rights; proposed <I><FONT color=brown>constitutional</FONT></I> amendments of the type that cannot become law until approved by a majority of electors voting at a referendum.] Strict usage distinguishes <I><FONT color=brown>constitutional</FONT></I> from all the other terms because of its direct reference to a document, instrument or body of rules acknowledged as paramount in determining what is <I><FONT color=brown>lawful</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>legal</FONT></I>: an appeal dismissed on <I><FONT color=brown>constitutional</FONT></I> grounds.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Legitimate</FONT></B> originally meant whatever was declared to be <I><FONT color=brown>lawful</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>legitimate</FONT></I> child; a <I><FONT color=brown>legitimate</FONT></I> owner of the land. It is now very generally applied to anything that is recognized by custom or in popular usage as conforming to established rules or standards, being regular, orderly or acceptable in form, style, etc.: <I><FONT color=brown>legitimate</FONT></I> theatre; a <I><FONT color=brown>legitimate</FONT></I> conclusion; <I><FONT color=brown>legitimate</FONT></I> procedures. <B><FONT color=blue>Licit</FONT></B> is the adjective form in English of the Latin verb <I><FONT color=brown>licet</FONT></I>, it is permitted.

lawlessness
<B><FONT color=blue>lawlessness</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>anarchy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>disorder</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>disturbance</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>riot</FONT></B>:

<P>All these words signify an absence, disruption or breakdown of law and order. <B><FONT color=blue>Lawlessness</FONT></B> implies either that no law exists or that the law is not being enforced or obeyed: the <I><FONT color=brown>lawlessness</FONT></I> of a Wild West town without a sheriff; the <I><FONT color=brown>lawlessness</FONT></I> of a band of outlaws. In a broad sense, this word may indicate disregard of any or all restrictive regulations: the <I><FONT color=brown>lawlessness</FONT></I> of children who are allowed to run wild. <I><FONT color=brown>Lawlessness</FONT></I> may also apply to actions that are not controlled or authorized by law or in accord apply to actions that are not controlled or authorized by law or in accord with it: the <I><FONT color=brown>lawlessness</FONT></I> of his behaviour; the <I><FONT color=brown>lawlessness</FONT></I> of a rioting mob. <B><FONT color=blue>Anarchy</FONT></B> comes from Greek roots that literally mean without a leader. At its most extreme, it implies the lawless confusion and chaos that result when no central authority is exercised by anyone, either within or outside the law, and when no general rules of order are in effect: a newly independent colony plunged into <I><FONT color=brown>anarchy</FONT></I> by warring factions and a lack of central leadership; total <I><FONT color=brown>anarchy</FONT></I> after a nuclear holocaust, the only rules being every man or himself and survival of the fittest. In a general sense <I><FONT color=brown>anarchy</FONT></I> simply indicates the absence of government, society being regulated by voluntary agreement and marked by absolute individual freedom. In a disapproving sense, <I><FONT color=brown>anarchy</FONT></I> can also imply utter licence ?freedom unchecked by self-regulation and unrestrained by submission to authority: the anarchy of rebellious youth, seeking liberty without responsibility.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Lawlessness</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>anarchy</FONT></I> have to do with prevailing conditions. The remaining words, by contrast, apply to temporary breaches of the peace or to single incidents or outbreaks of unruly conduct. <B><FONT color=blue>Disturbance</FONT></B> is the mildest of these. A <I><FONT color=brown>disturbance</FONT></I> may be no ore than a slight commotion or an annoying racket, and it can be caused by a single person or by any number of people: a drunk creating a <I><FONT color=brown>disturbance</FONT></I> in a bar; people throwing an all-night party, castigated for causing a <I><FONT color=brown>disturbance</FONT></I> to the peace of a quiet neighbourhood. <B><FONT color=blue>Disorder</FONT></B> is the most general of all these words, but here it applies specifically to a <I><FONT color=brown>disturbance</FONT></I> of proper civic order: a man charged with <I><FONT color=brown>disorderly</FONT></I> conduct. As a noun in this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>disorder</FONT></I> generally implies that a number of people are involved and that there is considerably more confusion and commotion than in a <I><FONT color=brown>disturbance</FONT></I>: an outbreak of <I><FONT color=brown>disorder</FONT></I> in the gallery of the House before the demonstrators were ejected. <B><FONT color=blue>Riot</FONT></B> indicates the largest and most violent outbreak of the three. In law, a <I><FONT color=brown>riot</FONT></I> is a tumultuous <I><FONT color=brown>disturbance</FONT></I> of the public peach by three or more assembled persons, who, in the execution of some private object, do an act, lawful or unlawful, in a manner calculated to terrorize the people. As the word is commonly understood, a <I><FONT color=brown>riot</FONT></I> involves mob action, frenzy and often violence: a race <I><FONT color=brown>riot</FONT></I> in Detroit, marked by looting, burning and attacks on police. A <I><FONT color=brown>riot</FONT></I> often involves mass <I><FONT color=brown>lawlessness</FONT></I>, but it is usually not leaderless: a demagogue who deliberately inflamed his listeners to such a degree that they started a <I><FONT color=brown>riot</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Turbulent">TURBULENT</A>, <A href="entry://Unruly">UNRULY</A>, <A href="entry://Uprising">UPRISING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: discipline, law, lawfulness, legality, order, peace.</P>

<P>These words all designate persons who have had legal training and are qualified to practise law. <B><FONT color=blue>Lawyer</FONT></B> is the general term for anyone versed in the law and duly admitted to practice. <I><FONT color=brown>Lawyers</FONT></I> conduct lawsuits, advise clients of their legal rights and obligations, and may act on behalf of clients or plead for them in court. <B><FONT color=blue>Attorney</FONT></B> is often used as a synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>lawyer</FONT></I> in a general sense. In its strictest sense it denotes an agent (who is not necessarily a lawyer) empowered to act in a legal capacity for another person: While she was living in Europe, her brother had power of <I><FONT color=brown>attorney</FONT></I> over her property.</P><P>A qualified <I><FONT color=brown>lawyer</FONT></I> who is "called to the Bar" is known as a <B><FONT color=blue>barrister</FONT></B>. He is competent to conduct court cases and, as a specialist in one of the branches of the law, is called upon for technical legal opinions and advice. A <B><FONT color=blue>solicitor</FONT></B> is similarly qualified but is "admitted as a <I><FONT color=brown>Solicitor</FONT></I>." <I><FONT color=brown>Solicitors</FONT></I> can conduct court cases but the majority do not often do so. In general, a <I><FONT color=brown>solicitor</FONT></I> advises and assists clients in the ordering of their affairs, and, when required, he prepares the material to be used by a <I><FONT color=brown>barrister</FONT></I> in the conduct of a court case.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Counsel</FONT></B> is a general term applied to <I><FONT color=brown>barristers</FONT></I>.

leak
<B><FONT color=blue>leak</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>drip</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ooze</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>trickle</FONT></B>:

<P>These words apply to fluid that flows or drops little by little. <B><FONT color=blue>Leak</FONT></B> stresses the idea of accident. It refers to the unintended entry or escape of a fluid that is meant to be excluded or contained. [The roof <I><FONT color=brown>leaks</FONT></I>; Oil is <I><FONT color=brown>leaking</FONT></I> out of the crankcase; The tap is <I><FONT color=brown>leaking</FONT></I>.] The noun <I><FONT color=brown>leak</FONT></I> may designate a chance opening, as a hole, crack, crevice or faulty closure, through which fluid may pass. [The boat has sprung a <I><FONT color=brown>leak</FONT></I>; They plugged the <I><FONT color=brown>leak</FONT></I> in the dam.] In other respects, <I><FONT color=brown>leak</FONT></I> is the least specific of these words. It may apply to air, gas, light or electric current as well as to liquid: a <I><FONT color=brown>leaking</FONT></I> balloon; a punctured tyre <I><FONT color=brown>leaking</FONT></I> air. Unlike the other words, it may involve a fast, heavy or steady flow as well as a slow, slight or intermittent one: A <I><FONT color=brown>leak</FONT></I> in the plumbing flooded the bathroom.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Drip</FONT></B> means to fall in drops or to let liquid fall in drops: rain <I><FONT color=brown>dripping</FONT></I> from the eaves; <I><FONT color=brown>dripping</FONT></I> trees; fat that <I><FONT color=brown>drips</FONT></I> from roasting meat; children <I><FONT color=brown>dripping</FONT></I> ice cream on the floor. Something that <I><FONT color=brown>drips</FONT></I> may be <I><FONT color=brown>leaking</FONT></I> or overflowing: a <I><FONT color=brown>dripping</FONT></I> spigot; a comb <I><FONT color=brown>dripping</FONT></I> with honey. A paper bag may <I><FONT color=brown>drip</FONT></I> when a container in the bag is <I><FONT color=brown>leaking</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Drip</FONT></I> may also designate the sound of liquid falling drop by drop: the maddening <I><FONT color=brown>drip</FONT></I> of a <I><FONT color=brown>leaking</FONT></I> tap. Where <I><FONT color=brown>drip</FONT></I> implies a broken, staccato movement, <B><FONT color=blue>trickle</FONT></B> is used of liquid that runs gently. It indicates a slow fall or slight flow of liquid, either drop by drop or in a fine, thin stream: a <I><FONT color=brown>trickling</FONT></I> spout; a rivulet <I><FONT color=brown>trickling</FONT></I> over rocks; perspiration slowly <I><FONT color=brown>trickling</FONT></I> down his back. Fluid may <I><FONT color=brown>drip</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>trickle</FONT></I> either from a <I><FONT color=brown>leak</FONT></I> that was unforeseen or from an opening designed for the discharge of liquid. And <I><FONT color=brown>trickle</FONT></I> often suggests either that a flow has not been fully started or that it is petering out: Only a <I><FONT color=brown>trickle</FONT></I> of water came out of the garden hose.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ooze</FONT></B> indicates a slow leakage or a sluggish flow, as of a liquid squeezing out in droplets through small openings: sap <I><FONT color=brown>oozing</FONT></I> from a tree; gravy <I><FONT color=brown>oozing</FONT></I> from a hot pit; a wounded body <I><FONT color=brown>oozing</FONT></I> blood; Sweat <I><FONT color=brown>oozed</FONT></I> from his forehead and trickled down his cheeks. In an extended sense, <I><FONT color=brown>ooze</FONT></I> may be applied to any similar seepage: Vapours seemed to <I><FONT color=brown>ooze</FONT></I> out of the swamp. And it sometimes refers to the unctuous flow or easy movement of a substance that is thick and slippery: the <I><FONT color=brown>ooze</FONT></I> of oil; the <I><FONT color=brown>ooze</FONT></I> of mud between the toes.</P><P>In a figurative sense, <I><FONT color=brown>leak</FONT></I> refers to an unofficial or unauthorized divulging of information. [There was a <I><FONT color=brown>leak</FONT></I> in the security system; The news <I><FONT color=brown>leaked</FONT></I> out; An unnamed official <I><FONT color=brown>leaked</FONT></I> the story to the press.] <I><FONT color=brown>Trickle</FONT></I> may indicate movement in a very small stream, one thing or person at a time: only a <I><FONT color=brown>trickle</FONT></I> of information; a <I><FONT color=brown>trickle</FONT></I> of visitors; workers <I><FONT color=brown>trickling</FONT></I> out of a building shortly before 5.00 P.M. <I><FONT color=brown>Trickle</FONT></I> may also apply to an uncertain, rippling sound suggestive of trickling water: a <I><FONT color=brown>trickle</FONT></I> of applause. <I><FONT color=brown>Ooze</FONT></I> sometimes indicates the slow, silent escape of some vital quality: His courage <I><FONT color=brown>oozed</FONT></I> away. It may also imply the exuding of something as if through the pores: a politician <I><FONT color=brown>oozing</FONT></I> confidence and affability. <I><FONT color=brown>Drip</FONT></I> suggests a being saturated or laden with something that seems to spill over in liquid-like drops: a voice <I><FONT color=brown>dripping</FONT></I> with venom; a dowager <I><FONT color=brown>dripping</FONT></I> with diamonds.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Filter">FILTER</A>, <A href="entry://Flood">FLOOD</A>, <A href="entry://Flow">FLOW</A>, <A href="entry://Wet">WET</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the mastery of facts and concepts in a given field. <B><FONT color=blue>Learning</FONT></B> is the least formal of these words; it specifically suggests a background of orderly, prescribed instruction and study rather than a spontaneous or self-taught mastery of material: book <I><FONT color=brown>learning</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>learning</FONT></I> required to understand the obscure references of some modern authors. A related use of the word refers to the process of acquiring mastery: patterns of <I><FONT color=brown>learning</FONT></I> in primary-school children. Sometimes the word refers to the sum total of all understanding and wisdom: libraries where the <I><FONT color=brown>learning</FONT></I> of the ages accumulates.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Knowledge</FONT></B> is more commonly used in this comprehensive way, referring to all that can be or is known: struggles to increase man’s <I><FONT color=brown>knowledge</FONT></I> of the universe. <I><FONT color=brown>Knowledge</FONT></I> is more than a store of facts in the mind; it includes also the contribution of the mind in understanding data, perceiving relations, elaborating concepts, formulating principles and making evaluations. As applied to a person, <I><FONT color=brown>knowledge</FONT></I> need not refer to information acquired through a formal education, as learning does; rather, <I><FONT color=brown>knowledge</FONT></I> simply points to an acquaintance with facts or an understanding of actions and concepts: a poor <I><FONT color=brown>knowledge</FONT></I> of Greek history. [She had a better <I><FONT color=brown>knowledge</FONT></I> of human nature than the cleverest psychiatrist, for all his <I><FONT color=brown>learning</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Knowledge</FONT></I>, thus, need not suggest an academic background at all, but can result from observation and experience. In this sense it is similar to the informal term <B><FONT color=blue>know-how</FONT></B>, which refers to special sometimes limited, but always handy, <I><FONT color=brown>knowledge</FONT></I> contrasts most sharply with <B><FONT color=blue>scholarship</FONT></B>, which emphasizes exclusively that aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>learning</FONT></I> pertaining to academic accomplishment. At one level, the word may simply suggest excellent work done in school: students receiving special awards for <I><FONT color=brown>scholarship</FONT></I>. At another level, it refers to care, precision and accuracy in searching out information and presenting facts, implying a mastery of techniques necessary for advanced research in specialized fields: the definitive book on the Medicis, marked by its authoritative mass of data and flawless <I><FONT color=brown>scholarship</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Erudition</FONT></B> refers to the personal mastery of a wide range of specialized <I><FONT color=brown>knowledge</FONT></I> in such a way as to combine both learning and scholarship. [He was not merely well-informed, but exhibited amazing <I><FONT color=brown>erudition</FONT></I> on every topic of conversation that came up; a Ph.D. candidate’s dazzling display of <I><FONT color=brown>erudition</FONT></I> in his comprehensive exams.] The word suggests a detailed grasp of the most abstruse or arcane points of <I><FONT color=brown>knowledge</FONT></I>. In this it compares with <B><FONT color=blue>pedantry</FONT></B>, which is pejorative word for the same grasp of detail, however obscure. The negative force of the word <I><FONT color=brown>pedantry</FONT></I>, of course, suggests that such details are dogmatically exploited for their own sake as a pharisaical display, without regard for their relevance to refining Ptolemy, while Copernicus and Brahe were altering the whole map of the heavens.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Fault-finding">FAULT-FINDING<A>, <A href="entry://Student">STUDENT</A>, <A href="entry://Teach">TEACH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: ignorance.</P>

<P>These words mean to get or grant the temporary use or possession of something, as a car, building, etc., in return for a certain payment. To do one of these things under the provisions of a governing contract is to <B><FONT color=blue>lease</FONT></B>. [I’m going to <I><FONT color=brown>lease</FONT></I> my house to a friend while I’m abroad next year; The land that the aluminium company <I><FONT color=brown>leased</FONT></I> proved to contain millions of tons of bauxite.] <B><FONT color=blue>Hire</FONT></B> is most commonly used in reference to paying a set sum or certain wages for a person’s labour or services: <I><FONT color=brown>hiring</FONT></I> a man to mow the lawn. [We <I><FONT color=brown>hired</FONT></I> a driver to take us on a tour of the city.] <I><FONT color=brown>Hire</FONT></I> also indicates the granting of personal service or temporary use: to <I><FONT color=brown>hire</FONT></I> oneself out as a mathematics tutor during the holidays; to <I><FONT color=brown>hire</FONT></I> out beach umbrellas to surfers. It is also employed when one wishes to designate paying for the temporary, exclusive use of another’s vehicle, premises or the like. [I <I><FONT color=brown>hired</FONT></I> a cab to take my girl home from the party; The school <I><FONT color=brown>hired</FONT></I> the local hall for its annual concert.] <B><FONT color=blue>Charter</FONT></B> is synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>hire</FONT></I> in reference to vehicles, especially large public vehicles, as buses, aircraft and trains: We <I><FONT color=brown>chartered</FONT></I> a bus for the picnic. <I><FONT color=brown>Charter</FONT></I>, however, also designates a specialized kind of <I><FONT color=brown>hiring</FONT></I> done in connection with a contract called a <I><FONT color=brown>charter</FONT></I>-party, an agreement under which the whole or part of a vessel is leased for the conveyance of goods.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rent</FONT></B> is usually applied to the payment of an agreed amount for the temporary possession and use of premises, land or property. We <I><FONT color=brown>rented</FONT></I> a cottage at the seaside for the Christmas holidays; a flat-dweller who <I><FONT color=brown>rented</FONT></I> a nearby garage for his car. The sense of impermanence is not always present, however, as in the case of families who cannot afford to build a home or do not wish to, and who live in <I><FONT color=brown>rented</FONT></I> houses for periods of many years.

leave

<P>These verbs all mean to depart from a person, place, pursuit, party or principle. <B><FONT color=blue>Leave</FONT></B> is the most general word in the group and is relatively free of the connotations that cling to the others. It is often used non-committally to indicate a straightforward physical departure: he left his home-town and moved to the big city. <I><FONT color=brown>Leave</FONT></I> in itself gives no hint as to the motives behind or consequences of a departure. One person may leave it merely to seek a milder climate. <I><FONT color=brown>Leave</FONT></I> may also refer in a more abstract sense to the termination of a connection or association: He <I><FONT color=brown>left</FONT></I> the advertising profession but continued to mix with agency people.</P><P>In other uses, <I><FONT color=brown>leave</FONT></I> may be closely synonymous with the other words in this group, though all the others are more emotionally laden. <B><FONT color=blue>Abandon</FONT></B> denotes a complete giving up, especially of what one has previously been interested in or responsible for; the word points to total relinquishment or withdrawal, sometimes under pressure of circumstances or in breach of duty. A man may, rightly or wrongly, <I><FONT color=brown>abandon</FONT></I> an attempt or an idealistic dream after encountering difficulties. A scientist may <I><FONT color=brown>abandon</FONT></I> an unpromising project to engage in more useful and rewarding research. A captain may give orders to <I><FONT color=brown>abandon</FONT></I> ship when the vessel is sinking. A military commander may justifiably <I><FONT color=brown>abandon</FONT></I> an exposed position, but for him to <I><FONT color=brown>abandon</FONT></I> his troops or his post would be reprehensible. <B><FONT color=blue>Desert</FONT></B> adds to abandon the idea that a legal or moral obligation or trust is being violated. It means to <I><FONT color=brown>abandon</FONT></I> a post, duty, relationship or loyalty in violation of one’s faith, oath, responsibility or orders: a recruit who <I><FONT color=brown>deserted</FONT></I> his platoon under fire; a turncoat who <I><FONT color=brown>deserted</FONT></I> his party.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Leave</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>abandon</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>desert</FONT></I> are all applied to marital or family relationships but often differ in their implications. A man who <I><FONT color=brown>leaves</FONT></I> his wife may do so openly and may still contribute to her support. A mother who <I><FONT color=brown>abandons</FONT></I> her child utterly relinquishes her personal responsibility for him, consigning his fate to chance or other people. A man who <I><FONT color=brown>deserts</FONT></I> his wife and children wilfully <I><FONT color=brown>abandons</FONT></I> them, without legal justification, with the intent to renounce entirely all legal and moral obligation.</P><P>In a specific, intransitive sense, <I><FONT color=brown>desert</FONT></I> means to leave military service without permission and with the intention of not returning. <I><FONT color=brown>Leave</FONT></I>, by contrast, may indicate no more than a temporary departure, while <I><FONT color=brown>abandon</FONT></I> may point to a position that has been left. [The sentry <I><FONT color=brown>left</FONT></I> his post for a few minutes; The soldier <I><FONT color=brown>abandoned</FONT></I> his post and <I><FONT color=brown>deserted</FONT></I>.] The past participles <I><FONT color=brown>abandoned</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>deserted</FONT></I> both emphasize the result of a departure, pointing to the condition of the place <I><FONT color=brown>left</FONT></I> empty or the plight of the result of a departure, pointing to the condition of the place <I><FONT color=brown>left</FONT></I> empty or the plight of the person <I><FONT color=brown>left</FONT></I> alone: the helpless, forlorn figure of an <I><FONT color=brown>abandoned</FONT></I> child; an outpost <I><FONT color=brown>abandoned</FONT></I> to the elements; an <I><FONT color=brown>abandoned</FONT></I> house falling into ruin, <I><FONT color=brown>left</FONT></I> desolate by its former occupants; a woman afraid to walk down a <I><FONT color=brown>deserted</FONT></I> street at night.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Forsake</FONT></B> implies the breaking off of a close personal attachment and may refer to a spiritual as well as to a physical <I><FONT color=brown>desertion</FONT></I>. It often involves the letting down of a loved one or dependant and may point to a lack of positive action as well as to a negative <I><FONT color=brown>abandonment</FONT></I>. [She pleaded with her husband not to <I><FONT color=brown>forsake</FONT></I> her; to <I><FONT color=brown>forsake</FONT></I> one’s friends by failing to go to their aid when they are in trouble.] <I><FONT color=brown>Forsake</FONT></I> may also mean to give up something that once was cherished or was freely indulged in or enjoyed. [Arthur Rimbaud <I><FONT color=brown>forsook</FONT></I> poetry at the age of nineteen; Doubts led the girl to <I><FONT color=brown>forsake</FONT></I> her faith and <I><FONT color=brown>leave</FONT></I> the church; In the marriage ceremony, the groom promised that, <I><FONT color=brown>forsaking</FONT></I> all other, he would keep him only unto his wife.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Forswear">FORSWEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Relinquish">RELINQUISH</A>, <A href="entry://Renegade">RENEGADE</A>, <A href="entry://Resign">RESIGN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: keep, persevere in, stay at, stay in, stay with, stick to, stick with.</P>

<P>These words refer to what exists as a superfluous quantity once the needed or used portion of something has been subtracted. <B><FONT color=blue>Left-over</FONT></B> is relatively informal in pointing to any such entity, concrete or abstract. Often, it suggests a survival from an earlier period: an idea that was a <I><FONT color=brown>left-over</FONT></I> from the Victorian era. It particularly pertain to food not eaten at a given meal, suggesting something saved to be eaten later or prepared in a different way; in this use, it is often plural: observing that they’d probably be eating <I><FONT color=brown>left-overs</FONT></I> from the Christmas dinner for the next month. <B><FONT color=blue>Residue</FONT></B> is much more formal and points more exclusively to actual material <I><FONT color=brown>left-overs</FONT></I>, but with the suggestion that these are wasted or unusable portions: scraping the <I><FONT color=brown>residue</FONT></I> of food from the plates before putting them under water. Most specifically, the word refers to dregs or to insoluble matter left behind by the filtration or evaporation of a liquid: hard water that leaves a chalky <I><FONT color=brown>residue</FONT></I> when it is boiled away. <B><FONT color=blue>Surplus</FONT></B> indicates something in excess of need, but, in contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>residue</FONT></I>, this amount might be perfectly usable and possibly beneficial: agreeing to share any <I><FONT color=brown>surplus</FONT></I> funds after all expenses were paid. The word is particularly used to indicate stored farm produce or excess military supplies: grain silos for storing the season’s wheat <I><FONT color=brown>surplus</FONT></I>; labelling the older-model binoculars as <I><FONT color=brown>surplus</FONT></I>.</P><P>The remaining words are much more general, having fewer connotations about the nature of the left-over. <B><FONT color=blue>Remainder</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>balance</FONT></B> can both point to the amount left after subtracting one sum from another; the former often appears in the context of arithmetic, the latter in accounting. Both can be used more generally to suggest a partial quantity viewed in separation from the whole for any reason: grating half the carrots and dicing the <I><FONT color=brown>remainder</FONT></I>; They burned the obviously outdated books before deciding what to do with the <I><FONT color=brown>balance</FONT></I>. The only distinction here is that <I><FONT color=brown>balance</FONT></I> has a more formal tone and can sometimes sound out of place beyond its natural context of accounting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rest</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of all these words; it can refer to anything that remains outside some designated amount. [He asked John to come with him and told the <I><FONT color=brown>rest</FONT></I> of the boys to stay where they were; I wondered how I’d live through the <I><FONT color=brown>rest</FONT></I> of the week; Only one of her reasons really mattered, and the <I><FONT color=brown>rest</FONT></I> were wide of the mark.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Marginal">MARGINAL</A>.</P>

left-winger
<B><FONT color=blue>left-winger</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>communist</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>liberal</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>progressive</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>radical</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>socialist</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to persons whose ideologies stress the elimination of inequalities, especially those resting on privilege and inherited wealth. <B><FONT color=blue>Left-winger</FONT></B> arose as a term because in many European countries, conservatives are seated on the presiding officer’s right while their opponents are seated on the left. This gave rise to the practice of locating political movements, ideologies and activists on a spectrum of fairly general applicability. This spectrum reads, from left to right: <B><FONT color=blue>communist</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>socialist</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>progressive</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>liberal</FONT></B>, conservative, reactionary, fascist. At both ends of the spectrum, left and right, are those who are called <B><FONT color=blue>radicals</FONT></B>, in that they favour drastic measures, such as revolution, in order to achieve a complete re-structuring of society. In common usage in countries such as Australia, the word <I><FONT color=brown>radical</FONT></I> is usually taken to mean <I><FONT color=brown>left-winger</FONT></I>, presumably because at present there are many more <I><FONT color=brown>radicals</FONT></I> on the left than on the right. In practice, extreme <I><FONT color=brown>left-wingers</FONT></I> experience great difficulty in realizing the goals of their ideology. Thus, in the Soviet Union, great inequalities in power and wealth have become apparent, while the official ideology still stresses the communist’s goal of equality and shared ownership of the nation’s wealth. Because of this, and because of those on the right often attempt to equate <I><FONT color=brown>communist</FONT></I> with <I><FONT color=brown>socialist</FONT></I>, parties such as the Australian Labor Party have come to stress their commitment to the ideal of equality by describing themselves as democratic <I><FONT color=brown>socialists</FONT></I>. Nevertheless, certain similarities between <I><FONT color=brown>communists</FONT></I> and socialists remain, such as a stress on the working class as a politically <I><FONT color=brown>progressive</FONT></I> element in such society, and advocacy of social (as opposed to capitalist) control of the means of production ?which usually, but not invariably, has meant control by the State.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Liberal</FONT></B>, according to its etymology, pertains to someone devoted to freedom. In theory, therefore, there is no necessary reason why the word should carry the connotation of <I><FONT color=brown>left-winger</FONT></I>: Many <I><FONT color=brown>liberals</FONT></I> in the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century believed that there was a conflict between freedom and equality. In this century, <I><FONT color=brown>liberals</FONT></I> have come to stress the desirability of the egalitarian goal of guaranteeing basic freedoms for all, and may thus be considered left of the centre of the spectrum, although they still differ from <I><FONT color=brown>socialists</FONT></I> in their distaste for direct governmental control of the economic sector. In Australia, the Liberal Party is generally considered to be the more <I><FONT color=brown>right-wing</FONT></I> of the two major parties, but is still to the left of centre when compared with most non-labour parties in other countries. Outside the political sphere, <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> can refer to someone who favours tolerance, permissiveness and constructive change, as in education and theology: A <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> who favoured the new maths; those cardinals at the Ecumenical Council who became known as <I><FONT color=brown>liberals</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Progressive</FONT></B> is a word that has been used most commonly in political discourse in the United States. Thus it has at least twice appeared in the name of a U.S. third party to the left of Democratic Party <I><FONT color=brown>liberals</FONT></I>. The term would usually imply a stance more activist than that of a <I><FONT color=brown>liberal</FONT></I> but one more moderate than that of a <I><FONT color=brown>socialist</FONT></I>. On the other hand, the word can sometimes be used simply to indicate militance of the left: The <I><FONT color=brown>Progressive</FONT></I> Labor Party in the United States. Used more generally outside politics, the word can suggest someone who is forward-looking and dynamic: a <I><FONT color=brown>progressive</FONT></I> businessman who had contributed to many community and civic projects.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anarchism">ANARCHISM</A>, <A href="entry://Socialism">SOCIALISM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: RIGHT-WINGER.</P>

<P>These words refer to a feeling or situation of pleasurable serenity. <B><FONT color=blue>Comfort</FONT></B> suggests the possession of complete peace of mind and physical contentment, either through the satisfaction of all needs and desires or through the elimination of anything unpleasant or disturbing: airlines that vie with each other over details of passenger <I><FONT color=brown>comfort</FONT></I>; prescribing a pill that would allow him to sleep in <I><FONT color=brown>comfort</FONT></I>; beachgoers seeking <I><FONT color=brown>comfort</FONT></I> from the heat wave. <B><FONT color=blue>Relief</FONT></B> is specifically restricted to this last possibility of comfort, stressing the removal of unpleasant or painful stimuli. Even here, <I><FONT color=brown>relief</FONT></I> is more restricted to expressing the mere absence of negative elements, whereas comfort might suggest replacing them with something positive: a medication for <I><FONT color=brown>relief</FONT></I> of sunburn; finding <I><FONT color=brown>relief</FONT></I> from his doubts but little <I><FONT color=brown>comfort</FONT></I> in the new doctrine.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ease</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>relaxation</FONT></B> refer exclusively to positive states and so relate to a side of <I><FONT color=brown>comfort</FONT></I> in contrast to simple <I><FONT color=brown>relief</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Ease</FONT></I> has the widest range of any of these words, referring to things that make for contentment, like <I><FONT color=brown>comfort</FONT></I>, but going beyond this word to suggest utter naturalness, lack of tension, or profound mental and physical peacefulness: taking our <I><FONT color=brown>ease</FONT></I> in the cool of the garden; the <I><FONT color=brown>ease</FONT></I> with which she made the arrangements; a smile that put us immediately at <I><FONT color=brown>ease</FONT></I>; never having felt so full of <I><FONT color=brown>ease</FONT></I> in his life. <I><FONT color=brown>Relaxation</FONT></I> is much more limited in reference than <I><FONT color=brown>ease</FONT></I>; it refers particularly to a state of freedom from or dwindling away of tension: a secluded corner where he could work with complete <I><FONT color=brown>relaxation</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>relaxation</FONT></I> of hostilities; arm muscles paired in a continual opposition of tension and <I><FONT color=brown>relaxation</FONT></I>. The word also has a special informal use to pertain to recreation: asking him what he did for <I><FONT color=brown>relaxation</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Leisure</FONT></B> is the most restricted of these words in relating exclusively to this last use of <I><FONT color=brown>relaxation</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Leisure</FONT></B> refers, most specifically, to one’s free time after work, regardless of how the time is spent: having the <I><FONT color=brown>leisure</FONT></I> to pursue a new hobby; executives who carry office tensions to the <I><FONT color=brown>leisure</FONT></I> of the golf course.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rest</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>repose</FONT></B> are an intensification of possibilities for <I><FONT color=brown>ease</FONT></I>, suggesting an extreme peacefulness and a quiescence approaching sleep. <I><FONT color=brown>Rest</FONT></I>, in fact, may be used synonymously with sleep, or as a group word to include both waking and sleeping <I><FONT color=brown>relaxation</FONT></I>: recommending plenty of rest for the patient following the operation. As this example shows, <I><FONT color=brown>rest</FONT></I> may be used like <I><FONT color=brown>relief</FONT></I> to suggest a restorative process. <I><FONT color=brown>Repose</FONT></I> is the most formal of these words here and gives a lyrical tone. It suggests an utter stillness or lack of movement, implying a complete cessation of both desire and tension. Where <I><FONT color=brown>relaxation</FONT></I> can suggest a noisy letting off of steam, <I><FONT color=brown>repose</FONT></I> always suggests a profound quiet, as of contemplation: a <I><FONT color=brown>repose</FONT></I> so deep that he didn’t hear the conductor asking for his ticket; the town’s old-world sense of decorum and <I><FONT color=brown>repose</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Retire">RETIRE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: agitation, nervousness, restlessness, unrest.</P>

<P>These words refer to a flexible or complaisant attitude that shuns applying rules too strictly or that is more generous than standards of discipline or conduct might allow if interpreted literally. <B><FONT color=blue>Lenient</FONT></B> indicates a generous or indifferent lowering of standards, especially in the context of discipline meted out by a superior or authority. It is the most neutral of these words in its implications, although it can easily take on a mild tone either of approval or disapproval: a prep school that was more <I><FONT color=brown>lenient</FONT></I> than most towards minor infractions of the rules; arguing that rigid regimentation militates against learning, while an atmosphere of <I><FONT color=brown>lenient</FONT></I> approval assists it; He lacked a sense of responsibility because of his <I><FONT color=brown>lenient</FONT></I> upbringing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Merciful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>lax</FONT></B> are distinct from all these other words in adding to the general meaning an extreme emotional tone. They contrast sharply with each other, as well, <I><FONT color=brown>merciful</FONT></I> regarding the <I><FONT color=brown>lenient</FONT></I> attitude from a strongly favourable viewpoint, <I><FONT color=brown>lax</FONT></I> from nearly as strong a negative viewpoint. <I><FONT color=brown>Merciful</FONT></I>, furthermore, suggests compassion, <I><FONT color=brown>lax</FONT></I> laziness, indifference or slipshod incompetence. [He begged the headmaster to be <I><FONT color=brown>merciful</FONT></I>; The book’s worth was invalidated by its <I><FONT color=brown>lax</FONT></I> standards of accuracy; When the spirit and letter of the law appear to be in conflict, a judge is merciful, not <I><FONT color=brown>lax</FONT></I>, in upholding the spirit.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indulgent</FONT></B> is seldom neutral. It can carry a mild positive charge. Suggesting generosity, in a context pertaining to affectionate relationships; sometimes in such a context, however, and in most other uses, it is more strongly negative, suggesting undiscriminating or irresponsible complaisance: a jolly, <I><FONT color=brown>indulgent</FONT></I> uncle; too <I><FONT color=brown>indulgent</FONT></I> of her children’s every caprice or tantrum; a magazine that is <I><FONT color=brown>indulgent</FONT></I> of the unexamined prejudices and meretricious tastes of its readers. <B><FONT color=blue>Tolerant</FONT></B> is far less emotionally charged, approaching neutral description in most uses. In addition to indicating a flexible attitude towards rules of standards, it can suggest approval for an open-minded reluctance to make hasty judgements or disapproval for condescending rather than equal treatment: he informed his students that he could be <I><FONT color=brown>tolerant</FONT></I> of those who fell asleep in his class provided they didn’t snore; <I><FONT color=brown>tolerant</FONT></I> of the attitudes and beliefs of others; <I><FONT color=brown>tolerant</FONT></I> of but not enthusiastic about the new teenage fads.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Permissive</FONT></B> is a much more formal word than the others, referring descriptively to an educational approach that allows the child’s interest and capacities to determine content and rate of progress: the <I><FONT color=brown>permissive</FONT></I> theories of progressive education. The word, less specifically, may refer to an extremely lenient way of child-rearing. [The children of <I><FONT color=brown>permissive</FONT></I> parents often give their own children an authoritarian upbringing, and vice versa.] Partisans of a <I><FONT color=brown>permissive</FONT></I> approach, in either context, might use the term in neutral description, but critics of this approach may well use the word as a pejorative label: <I><FONT color=brown>permissive</FONT></I> theories that resulted, at best, in well-adjusted ignoramuses. Outside the contexts of education and psychology, the word is widely used as a synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>tolerant</FONT></I>, but goes beyond the latter in suggesting not only open-minded detachment but a passive acceptance of involvement as well: the question of how <I><FONT color=brown>permissive</FONT></I> girls should be when they start going out with boys.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compliant">COMPLIANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: exacting, rigid, severe, stern, strict.</P>

<P>These words all indicates the act of reducing the intensity or severity of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Lessen</FONT></B> is the most informal of these and the most general, applying both to a decrease in intensity and severity. It often suggests the subtracting of a part from a whole, as in its legal use: an appeal to <I><FONT color=brown>lessen</FONT></I> the sentence of the convicted man; a higher court <I><FONT color=brown>lessened</FONT></I> the amount the defendant would have to pay. But the word can apply neutrally to any reduction in degree or quantity: The flight to suburbia <I><FONT color=brown>lessened</FONT></I> the number of middle-class families living in the city itself.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lighten</FONT></B> is metaphorically graphic in referring to a decrease in the weight of something; <B><FONT color=blue>soften</FONT></B> is comparably graphic in referring to a decrease in the harshness, roughness or force of something, both are more often favourable in their implications than <I><FONT color=brown>lessen</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Lighten</FONT></I> would apply most naturally where an existing burden is partially lifted, <I><FONT color=brown>soften</FONT></I> most naturally where the full impact of something is prevented from being felt: technology that served to <I><FONT color=brown>lighten</FONT></I> the work load of the factory employee; an attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>soften</FONT></I> the blow by telling her the good news first. In this context, <B><FONT color=blue>temper</FONT></B> refers to making something more moderate, that is, more temperate: a sea breeze that <I><FONT color=brown>tempered</FONT></I> the noonday heat. But another use of the same word gives a meaning that is diametrically opposed, referring to the act of hardening or toughening something: young bodies <I><FONT color=brown>tempered</FONT></I> by rigorous exercise. Thus, unless the context is clear, the use of this word can result in confusion.</P><P>The remaining words all emphasize a reduction in severity; they are also alike in pointing to the reduction or removal of something negative or undesirable, rather than the mere subtraction of one amount from another. <B><FONT color=blue>Allay</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>assuage</FONT></B> can both refer to the calming or satisfying of desire or appetite, but, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>allay</FONT></I> can often suggest a partial lulling or pacifying, assuage might better indicate something approaching satiation: an attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>allay</FONT></I> their hunger by nibbling roots and berries; a huge dinner that <I><FONT color=brown>assuaged</FONT></I> his ravenous appetite. In other uses, furthermore, where <I><FONT color=brown>assuage</FONT></I> remains more strictly tied to the notion of a need that requires satisfaction, <I><FONT color=brown>allay</FONT></I> can function more widely for any appeasing action: reassuring words that <I><FONT color=brown>assuaged</FONT></I> her fear; a codeine tablet to <I><FONT color=brown>allay</FONT></I> the pain. In the former example, <I><FONT color=brown>allay</FONT></I> would suggest less conclusive relief, whereas in the latter <I><FONT color=brown>assuage</FONT></I> would seem out of place.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Alleviate</FONT></B> is closest to <I><FONT color=brown>allay</FONT></I> but is even more emphatic about partial relief; it is also restricted to situations in which something is made easier to bear. Thus, it is a more specific and more formal intensification of lighten: early attempts to <I><FONT color=brown>alleviate</FONT></I> conditions in mental hospitals that preceded this century’s thoroughgoing reform in mental care; drugs to <I><FONT color=brown>alleviate</FONT></I> the pain of terminal patients. <B><FONT color=blue>Mitigate</FONT></B>, which comes from a Latin word meaning to soften, can refer more formally to the partial <I><FONT color=brown>lessening</FONT></I> of need, pain or hardship: programmes to <I><FONT color=brown>mitigate</FONT></I> the disruptive effects of slum living; rehabilitative therapy to <I><FONT color=brown>mitigate</FONT></I> the after-effects of strokes and heart attacks; the judge’s decision to <I><FONT color=brown>mitigate</FONT></I> the man’s sentence in light of his previous record. <B><FONT color=blue>Palliate</FONT></B>, in its most common usage today, means to relieve (<I><FONT color=brown>alleviate</FONT></I>) the symptoms of a disease and thus to <I><FONT color=brown>mitigate</FONT></I> the suffering caused by it.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Decrease">DECREASE</A>, <A href="entry://Reduce">REDUCE</A>, <A href="entry://Wane">WANE</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Escalate">ESCALATE</A>, <A href="entry://Extend">EXTEND</A>, heighten, toughen.</P>

It can equally well suggest having sexual desires, acting on them or arousing them. Used of a person, it implies thoroughgoing immorality: <I><FONT color=brown>lewd</FONT></I> soldiers on the town. Used of thoughts or feelings, it implies coarseness of sexual appetite, untinged by affection, tenderness or love, but it does not necessarily imply action: <I><FONT color=brown>lewd</FONT></I> glances at every passing woman.

Used of behaviour, it may be considerably weaker, connoting only a provocative or suggestive seductiveness: the <I><FONT color=brown>lewd</FONT></I> poses of the chorus girls.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Licentious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wanton</FONT></B> emphasize the active satisfaction of desire, although neither word is restricted in meaning to sexual impulse alone. <I><FONT color=brown>Licentious</FONT></I> can suggest any kind of excessive freedom in behaviour that goes past legal or moral bounds or violates customary standards of behaviour: a <I><FONT color=brown>licentious</FONT></I> attitude towards premarital affairs. <I><FONT color=brown>Wanton</FONT></I>, by contrast, does not suggest extreme freedom so much as unruly or wasteful self-indulgence. Used of people or people’s behaviour it suggests sensuality more than sexuality: the <I><FONT color=brown>wanton</FONT></I>, fast-living film colony. Only in its sense of gratuitous does it suggest extreme inhumanity or cruelty: <I><FONT color=brown>wanton</FONT></I> slaughter.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lustful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>lecherous</FONT></B> may suggest unacted-upon desire as well as the active seeking of satisfaction: a <I><FONT color=brown>lecherous</FONT></I> mood; a <I><FONT color=brown>lustful</FONT></I> disposition. <I><FONT color=brown>Lustful</FONT></I> suggests a permanent character trait not likely to remain unexpressed, while <I><FONT color=brown>lecherous</FONT></I> can be used to refer to a momentary desire for a particular person: goaded by <I><FONT color=brown>lecherous</FONT></I> feelings for his new secretary. Neither of these words is likely to be used for pornographic materials, designed to arouse desire.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lascivious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>prurient</FONT></B>, unlike the other words here, tend to be restricted more specifically to having sexual desire than to acting upon it. Both words are commonly used to describe the feelings that pornography in particular is intended to incite, with <I><FONT color=brown>prurient</FONT></I> being the word favoured in legal terminology: whether a book taken as a whole arouses <I><FONT color=brown>prurient</FONT></I> interests in the average person and is utterly without redeeming social importance. <I><FONT color=brown>Lascivious</FONT></I> is milder and stresses inclination, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>prurient</FONT></I> stresses susceptibility.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Salacious</FONT></B>, alone of these words, most usually suggests the material intended to incite sexual fantasies or desires: <I><FONT color=brown>salacious</FONT></I> movies shown at smokos.</P><P>In general, sexual impulses per se are not so widely disapproved of a formerly, and a present-day view of what should be classified as <I><FONT color=brown>lewd</FONT></I> and what as zestful high spirits would differ drastically from a 19<SUP>th</SUP>-century view.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, <A href="entry://Erotic">EROTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Indecent">INDECENT</A>, <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chaste">CHASTE</A>, <A href="entry://Innocent">INNOCENT</A>, pure.</P>

<P>These words refer to statements or formulations that are misleading or contrary to fact. Lie is the most general of these, but it is exclusively restricted to a conscious and deliberate intention to distort the truth. [She told a <I><FONT color=brown>lie</FONT></I> about how much the new dress had cost her; It was a <I><FONT color=brown>lie</FONT></I> that no arms shipments were being sent to the front.] In heated debate, the word is often applied more loosely to inadvertent misstatements or statements thought to be hypocritical: It’s simply a <I><FONT color=brown>lie</FONT></I> that may opponent could carry out all these campaign promises without increasing taxes. Sometimes, the word can apply to masking an unpleasant situation with a pleasant exterior: She was unwilling to live a <I><FONT color=brown>lie</FONT></I> for the sake of her husband’s political future. In the idiom give the <I><FONT color=brown>lie</FONT></I> to, a conclusive disproof of an assertion or theory is indicated: evidence that gave the <I><FONT color=brown>lie</FONT></I> to their claim of having remained strictly neutral during the crisis.</P><P>By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>rationalization</FONT></B> is very specific, indicating a thought process by which one attempts to justify one’s actions, either to oneself or to others, by consciously or unconsciously distorting the truth. Although psychologists may view all formulated explanations as <I><FONT color=brown>rationalizations</FONT></I>, the word has become a fad word for ingenious but specious reasoning that puts one’s own behaviour in the most favourable light possible: The psychiatrist works to get behind the web of <I><FONT color=brown>rationalizations</FONT></I> to the real conflicts and anxieties they conceal; his <I><FONT color=brown>rationalization</FONT></I> that being late for work was a forgivable foible, considering how indispensable he was to the office; Nazis whose <I><FONT color=brown>rationalization</FONT></I> was that they were only obeying orders.</P><P>The remaining words can all be used as euphemisms for lie. <B><FONT color=blue>Fib</FONT></B>, the most informal of these words, is exclusively used in this way, suggesting a trivial, harmless or forgivable <I><FONT color=brown>lie</FONT></I>: She turned him down with a <I><FONT color=brown>fib</FONT></I> about already having an engagement for the evening. The word may now sound a bit dated. <B><FONT color=blue>Prevarication</FONT></B>, the most formal word here, would be taken by many as an extremely offensive and over-fancy euphemism for <I><FONT color=brown>lie</FONT></I>; as such, it might be useful as humour or irony: comforted that the commandment prohibiting <I><FONT color=brown>lies</FONT></I> said nothing about <I><FONT color=brown>prevarication</FONT></I>. The word can have a special area of meaning that refers not to bald misstatements of fact but to the deceptive statement of half-truths ?a distinction that would be lost on many people.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Falsehood</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>untruth</FONT></B>, as euphemisms, are less formal circumlocutions than <I><FONT color=brown>prevarication</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Falsehood</FONT></I>, however, has a legitimate reference to any incorrectness, whether intentional or not: The falsehood of this prevalent notion is now inescapable. <I><FONT color=brown>Untruth</FONT></I> can sometimes refer to fictions that were never intended to mislead or be taken as fact: Novelists devise untruths that sometimes have a greater validity than the statistical truths of the social sciences.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deception">DECEPTION</A>, <A href="entry://Guile">GUILE</A>, <A href="entry://Misleading">MISLEADING</A>, <A href="entry://Trick">TRICK</A> (n.), <A href="entry://Trick">TRICK</A> (v.).</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: honesty, truth, veracity.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Listing</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>list</FONT></B> refer to any itemized series of names, words, etc., especially when recorded in a set order: a <I><FONT color=brown>list</FONT></I> of candidates arranged by electorate; a <I><FONT color=brown>listing</FONT></I> of drugs authorized for sale by the health Department. <I><FONT color=brown>Listing</FONT></I> is also used to mean an entry in a <I><FONT color=brown>list</FONT></I>: Please check your <I><FONT color=brown>listing</FONT></I> in the new telephone book and notify us of any mistakens.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Register</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>roll</FONT></B> apply to lists of names. A register is a formal or official written record of names or transactions: a <I><FONT color=brown>register</FONT></I> of births or deaths. <I><FONT color=brown>Registers</FONT></I> are typically designed to preserve important information for future reference. A <I><FONT color=brown>roll</FONT></I>, on the other hand, is often a temporary <I><FONT color=brown>listing</FONT></I> of names, as of students in a class or soldiers in a military unit: The teacher called the <I><FONT color=brown>roll</FONT></I> every morning to see who was absent. Any list of names may be called a <B><FONT color=blue>roster</FONT></B>, but the word usually refers to a <I><FONT color=brown>list</FONT></I> of names of people enrolled for a particular kind of duty: a <I><FONT color=brown>roster</FONT></I> of nurses for weekend duty; chemists in a district <I><FONT color=brown>rostered</FONT></I> to provide a night-prescription service. In the armed forces, duty <I><FONT color=brown>roster</FONT></I> are maintained to ensure that special duties, such as guard duty, are fairly assigned to each eligible man, that is, at roughly equal intervals; the order in which names are listed on <I><FONT color=brown>rosters</FONT></I>, therefore, is all-important.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inventory</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>catalogue</FONT></B> refer to special kinds of <I><FONT color=brown>listings</FONT></I>, an <I><FONT color=brown>inventory</FONT></I> is a <I><FONT color=brown>list</FONT></I> of articles with the description and quantity of each. <I><FONT color=brown>Inventories</FONT></I> are periodically taken in warehouses, factories and retail stores to record the number or objects, usually in alphabetical order and often with some accompanying description. A card <I><FONT color=brown>catalogue</FONT></I> in a library <I><FONT color=brown>lists</FONT></I> the title and author of the book, periodical, etc., and perhaps other useful information, such as the number of pages, the copyright date, where and by whom the work was published, an identifying number and sometimes an indication of the subject or contents. The <I><FONT color=brown>catalogue</FONT></I> of a mail-order house <I><FONT color=brown>lists</FONT></I> the articles offered for sale, with accompanying descriptions and prices. Figuratively, any methodical <I><FONT color=brown>listing</FONT></I> can be called a catalogue: He gave me a long <I><FONT color=brown>catalogue</FONT></I> of woes: his car broke down, he had a fight with is girlfriend, he caught a cold, and so on.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accumulation">ACCUMULATION</A>, <A href="entry://Quantity">QUANTITY</A>.</P>

<P>All these words pertain to a lack of spirit or energy. <B><FONT color=blue>Listless</FONT></B> is the least formal of these and the most wide-ranging in application. At its most specific, the word can indicate slow or sluggish movement, at its most general a lack of the vibrance associated with good health or high spirits: He responded to my question with a <I><FONT color=brown>listless</FONT></I> shrug of his shoulders; the <I><FONT color=brown>listless</FONT></I> faces of a family on relief; a class of <I><FONT color=brown>listless</FONT></I> children on a 100-degree day. Most often, the word suggests a general apathy that may well be the result of disease or physical or mental fatigue.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Languid</FONT></B> can also indicate a lack of interest or animation that may stem from poor health or fatigue, but it can also (and perhaps more often) indicate an avoidance of physical exertion as a matter of choice or temperament rather than of necessity: drooped in her <I><FONT color=brown>languid</FONT></I> pose on a bench while her friends walked from painting to painting in the exhibition. It can also suggest the affecting of a slow or lazy manner: the <I><FONT color=brown>languid</FONT></I> drawl with which he spoke. In a way that listless cannot, <I><FONT color=brown>languid</FONT></I> can indicate anything that is lacking in force: a <I><FONT color=brown>languid</FONT></I> wind that offered no relief from the heat. <B><FONT color=blue>Languorous</FONT></B> and <I><FONT color=brown>languid</FONT></I> both derive ultimately from the same French root, meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>languish</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Languorous</FONT></I> gives a distinct and specific meaning that points to the affecting of an effete or indolent dreaminess: an era of crisis in which many retired to <I><FONT color=brown>languorous</FONT></I> meditation and disengagement.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lethargic</FONT></B> concentrate on the aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>listless</FONT></I> that pertains to sluggish movement, but it is slightly more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>listless</FONT></I> and is considerably more critical or disapproving in tone. The word may, in fact, suggest laziness as the cause of this behaviour: too <I><FONT color=brown>lethargic</FONT></I> to get his homework done on time. <B><FONT color=blue>Lackadaisical</FONT></B> concentrates on a different aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>listless</FONT></I>, the one referring to a lack of vibrance, spirit or energy: reacting to the impassioned speech with a <I><FONT color=brown>lackadaisical</FONT></I> yawn; entrenched bureaucrats who are <I><FONT color=brown>lackadaisical</FONT></I> about proposals to make the system more efficient or humane. It can also refer to whatever is idle, indifferent or empty of value: a <I><FONT color=brown>lackadaisical</FONT></I> attitude towards standards of accuracy and objective scholarship.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impassive">IMPASSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Sloth">SLOTH</A>, <A href="entry://Tired">TIRED</A>, <A href="entry://Uninvolved">UNINVOLVED</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: energetic, <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>, spirited.</P>

<P>These words all describe people, things or actions that are full of or display great vigour and energy. <B><FONT color=blue>Lively</FONT></B> is the most general word and suggests energy of motion and great activity: a <I><FONT color=brown>lively</FONT></I> kitten; a party that turned out to be a very <I><FONT color=brown>lively</FONT></I> occasion; a gathering in which there was much <I><FONT color=brown>lively</FONT></I> conversation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Animated</FONT></B>, close in meaning to lively, is normally limited in application to people or to behaviour: an <I><FONT color=brown>animated</FONT></I> argument between a motorist and a traffic policeman; to become <I><FONT color=brown>animated</FONT></I> and talkative after two drinks.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Buoyant</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>spirited</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sprightly</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vivacious</FONT></B> all suggest a manner of speaking or acting marked by energy and good humour. <I><FONT color=brown>Buoyant</FONT></I>, which carries the suggestion of its literal meaning of floating, describes an irrepressible or resilient energy in manner or outlook: <I><FONT color=brown>buoyant</FONT></I> laughter; <I><FONT color=brown>buoyant</FONT></I> confidence in the future. <I><FONT color=brown>Spirited</FONT></I> suggests a high degree of vitality, sometimes mixed with daring. [Young stallions are very <I><FONT color=brown>spirited</FONT></I> animals; He made a <I><FONT color=brown>spirited</FONT></I> denial of having any knowledge of the crime.] <I><FONT color=brown>Sprightly</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>vivacious</FONT></I> add to the idea of energy the element of quick-wittedness and brightness: <I><FONT color=brown>sprightly</FONT></I> jokes; a <I><FONT color=brown>sprightly</FONT></I> old lady; a <I><FONT color=brown>vivacious</FONT></I> telling of a story; <I><FONT color=brown>vivacious</FONT></I> young girls.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brisk</FONT></B> may be applied to actions that exhibit an abundance of energy: He passed us at a <I><FONT color=brown>brisk</FONT></I> walk. <I><FONT color=brown>Brisk</FONT></I> may also describe a sharp, businesslike manner that approaches curtness but also implies a controlled vitality: He always spoke to his subordinates in a <I><FONT color=brown>brisk</FONT></I> tone.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Busy">BUSY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Listless">LISTLESS</A>.</P>

<P>These words all mean having life or manifesting signs of life. <B><FONT color=blue>Living</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>alive</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>live</FONT></B> may be applied interchangeably to functioning organisms in contrast to those that are dead. <I><FONT color=brown>Living</FONT></I> may sometimes refer only to the condition of not being dead. [He is the greatest <I><FONT color=brown>living</FONT></I> novelist in England; My grandfather is still <I><FONT color=brown>living</FONT></I> at the age of 93.] By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>living</FONT></I> may also describe things that are full of energy and significance or are actually operative: the <I><FONT color=brown>living</FONT></I> faith of Buddhists; <I><FONT color=brown>living</FONT></I> languages. <I><FONT color=brown>Alive</FONT></I> applies to all degrees of life, from that which is barely evident to that which implies the very utmost of vitality and power. [The mortally wounded man was unconscious but still <I><FONT color=brown>alive</FONT></I> when taken to the hospital; She is so <I><FONT color=brown>alive</FONT></I> that her presence in a room is electrifying.] <I><FONT color=brown>Live</FONT></I>, which is usually placed before the noun modified, may describe the condition of appearing in the flesh rather than being depicted in photographs, paintings, etc., or being preserved physically after death. [I was grown up before I saw a real, <I><FONT color=brown>live</FONT></I> gypsy; Having seen the stuffed gorillas at the museum, the little boy was delighted to observe his first <I><FONT color=brown>live</FONT></I> one at the zoo.] In television and radio, a <I><FONT color=brown>live</FONT></I> audience or <I><FONT color=brown>live</FONT></I> actors are actually present at the time of transmission rather than appearing in a taped performance. When applied to certain things, live carries over the idea of vital functioning.

<P>These words refer to living space consisting of a room or set of rooms forming part of a building or existing as a unit within some larger unit. <B><FONT color=blue>Lodgings</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>accommodation</FONT></B> are equally vague in referring to any sort of living arrangements, usually temporary. <I><FONT color=brown>Lodgings</FONT></I> can sound old-fashioned; <I><FONT color=brown>accommodation</FONT></I> while less informal in tone, is more current: troubadours who wandered through medieval France seeking <I><FONT color=brown>lodgings</FONT></I> for the night; asking him how he liked his <I><FONT color=brown>accommodation</FONT></I> at the hotel. The latter can also refer to a temporary, improvised arrangement, including the paraphernalia required to house a guest: setting up overnight <I><FONT color=brown>accommodation</FONT></I> for two more visitors by raiding the linen cupboard and calling into service the living-room lounge and camp stretcher.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Flat</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>apartment</FONT></B> are much more specific than the preceding, referring to sets of rooms usually rented and occupied for a longer term. As neutral description, <I><FONT color=brown>flat</FONT></I> is the preferred term in Australian and New Zealand speech, <I><FONT color=brown>apartment</FONT></I> in American speech. In U.S. usage, however, <I><FONT color=brown>flat</FONT></I> often refers to a cramped, inhospitable <I><FONT color=brown>apartment</FONT></I> without conveniences: a cold-water <I><FONT color=brown>flat</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>bedsitter</FONT></B> is a one-roomed <I><FONT color=brown>flat</FONT></I> which may include limited cooking facilities and bathroom or may have them adjacent.

<P>These words all relate to a lack or loss of friendship, love or interrelateness with others. <B><FONT color=blue>Loneliness</FONT></B> is the least formal and the most restricted in its application. It refers to a lack of companionship and usually implies an attendant feeling of unhappiness or unfulfilment: the stark <I><FONT color=brown>loneliness</FONT></I> of the widows and pensioners who live in residentials. The word may refer to a feeling rather than an actual condition of isolation: Her <I><FONT color=brown>loneliness</FONT></I> was never more acute than in a crowded theatre. Occasionally, the word can refer to a welcome state of seclusion or solitude: enjoying the <I><FONT color=brown>loneliness</FONT></I> of their life on the island. Also, the word can refer to the physical isolation of anything, whether this is regarded as pleasant, unpleasant or factually neutral the <I><FONT color=brown>loneliness</FONT></I> of a single tree silhouetted against the sky; the <I><FONT color=brown>loneliness</FONT></I> of their hut high in the mountains.</P><P>One use of <B><FONT color=blue>desolation</FONT></B> can serve as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>loneliness</FONT></I> in referring to someone utterly alone or inconsolably forsaken: the <I><FONT color=brown>desolation</FONT></I> of the city’s derelicts. Often the word can indicate an actual state of ruin or barrenness: the <I><FONT color=brown>desolation</FONT></I> left behind by the cyclone; the <I><FONT color=brown>desolation</FONT></I> of the Australian outback. The word can also refer to intense sorrow suffered because of a serious loss: the <I><FONT color=brown>desolation</FONT></I> he felt upon hearing the news of his brother’s death.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disaffection</FONT></B> is relatively formal; unlike the former pair, it most often suggests that an earlier fondness for someone has turned to indifference or mild distaste: She had regarded her husband over the years with a growing <I><FONT color=brown>disaffection</FONT></I>. Neither a complete separation from someone nor a transmutation of fondness into hatred need be suggested by the word. Often it has a stronger charge when it indicates someone deliberately at work to cause a more drastic change in feeling or allegiance, as in intrigues of love or politics: an envious friend who had actively promoted <I><FONT color=brown>disaffection</FONT></I> between the newly married couple; professional agitators who worked zealously to stir up <I><FONT color=brown>disaffection</FONT></I> and rebellion among the workers. <B><FONT color=blue>Estrangement</FONT></B> applies more exclusively to a voluntary <I><FONT color=brown>disaffection</FONT></I> that results in complete separation and, sometimes, a stronger feeling of dislike or hatred that replaces an earlier fondness or love: It was impossible to keep their <I><FONT color=brown>estrangement</FONT></I> secret, since they were living apart and had drawn up separation papers. Sometimes the word puts its emphasis on a process of cooling affection, without suggesting any compete break; here, it is close to <I><FONT color=brown>disaffection</FONT></I>, but it suggests a growing remoteness and lack of communication that may be involuntary: so busy with their separate concerns that neither noticed the <I><FONT color=brown>estrangement</FONT></I> that was gradually being driven between them like a wedge.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Alienation</FONT></B> applies more widely than any other of these words. It can be used in a way resembling the last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>estrangement</FONT></I>, but with a clearer implication that no separation need take place: pressure that resulted in a feeling of <I><FONT color=brown>alienation</FONT></I> towards each other. The phrase, <I><FONT color=brown>alienation of affection</FONT></I>, implies, like <I><FONT color=brown>disaffection</FONT></I>, a deliberate attempt to bring about a reversal of feelings towards someone, but this use of the word is now less common. At its most general, the word can apply to any feeling of unrelatedness, especially a hopeless feeling of distance from society’s structure and concerns: minority groups that must also cope with their own feelings of <I><FONT color=brown>alienation</FONT></I> from a society that rejects them. This fad use of the word derives ultimately from Marxism in which it is a technical term for the separation of a labourer from the fruits of his labour: Unlike the craftsman who took pride in his work, the assembly-line worker feels isolated and indifferent because of the <I><FONT color=brown>alienation</FONT></I> inherent in mass production.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lonely">LONELY</A>, <A href="entry://Modest">MODEST</A>, <A href="entry://Privacy">PRIVACY</A>, <A href="entry://Uninvolved">UNINVOLVED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Allegiance">ALLEGIANCE</A>, camaraderie, companionship, fellowship, mutuality, reconciliation.</P>

lonely
<B><FONT color=blue>lonely</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>forlorn</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lonesome</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>solitary</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are used to refer to people or places which are apart from others. <B><FONT color=blue>Lonely</FONT></B> is a broad term describing a state of mind which is induced by lack of companionship or the kind of sympathy which companionship can provide. A <I><FONT color=brown>lonely</FONT></I> feeling can range from the mild sadness engendered by a casual instance of solitude to the great unhappiness and depression one might feel after a long period of separation from or lack of meaningful relationship with other people: a <I><FONT color=brown>lonely</FONT></I> young sailor feeling sorry for himself because his date had stood him up; a <I><FONT color=brown>lonely</FONT></I> spinster whose eccentricities had robbed her of the opportunity for anything but the most impersonal kind of social contact. <I><FONT color=brown>Lonely</FONT></I> stretch of beach where it was possible to bathe in the nude. In reference to places, <B><FONT color=blue>lonesome</FONT></B> intensifies the meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>lonely</FONT></I> to suggest a place not merely deserted but having an air of melancholy about it: a house she had always thought of as over-crowded but which was <I><FONT color=brown>lonesome</FONT></I> and cavernous when her children grew up and went out on their own. In its description of people <I><FONT color=brown>lonesome</FONT></I> is again a stronger word than <I><FONT color=brown>lonely</FONT></I> but is slightly less formal in tone. It often suggests the dejection felt when one is faced with the absence of someone to whom one is or has been very close: a merchandising executive who never got over being <I><FONT color=brown>lonesome</FONT></I> when he had to leave his family for business travel; <I><FONT color=brown>lonesome</FONT></I> for a pet dog that he’d raised from a pup and that had just died.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Forlorn</FONT></B> is more specific than either of the two preceding words in its suggestion that the person described as such is alone because he has been deserted or abandoned: wretched and <I><FONT color=brown>forlorn</FONT></I> in the half-empty waiting room, despairing of the arrival of a friend who had promised to meet her but who was already three hours late. The place referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>forlorn</FONT></I> seems also to have been deserted and has the air of loneliness that characterizes remote or abandoned dwelling and locales: a once fashionable resort that was now a <I><FONT color=brown>forlorn</FONT></I> ghost town.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Solitary</FONT></B> can mean <I><FONT color=brown>lonely</FONT></I> and can describe a person or place: the <I><FONT color=brown>solitary</FONT></I> feeling one sometimes experiences in the middle of a crowded room; the <I><FONT color=brown>solitary</FONT></I> desert. But <I><FONT color=brown>solitary</FONT></I>, in a way that none of the other words in this group can, may suggest an aloneness that has been chosen rather than imposed. Thus, a person who is <I><FONT color=brown>solitary</FONT></I> by nature often prefers contemplation to companionship, and a <I><FONT color=brown>solitary</FONT></I> traveller prefers travelling alone to being with a large group on an organized tour.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aloof">ALOOF</A>, <A href="entry://Leave">LEAVE</A> (abandon), <A href="entry://Privacy">PRIVACY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: accompanied, attended, escorted, protected.</P>

<P>These words mean to turn the eyes towards something either in an effort to see it or to convey a specific meaning or emotion. <B><FONT color=blue>Look</FONT></B> is the most general word and may mean merely to direct the eyes: to <I><FONT color=brown>look</FONT></I> out the window; to <I><FONT color=brown>look</FONT></I> at pictures in a magazine. One may also <I><FONT color=brown>look</FONT></I> in such a way as to communicate particular feeling: to <I><FONT color=brown>look</FONT></I> wistfully at a mink coat; to <I><FONT color=brown>look</FONT></I> daggers at an intruder.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gaze</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>look</FONT></I> long and steadily, often with the implication of wonder, admiration, fascination, etc.: to <I><FONT color=brown>gaze</FONT></I> at a beautiful view; to <I><FONT color=brown>gaze</FONT></I> into the eyes of a loved one.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Glance</FONT></B> refers to the act of <I><FONT color=brown>looking</FONT></I> briefly at something when one is preoccupied or in a hurry. [On the bus I always manage to <I><FONT color=brown>glance</FONT></I> at the headlines in the newspaper.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Peer</FONT></B> suggests a looking with a narrowing of the eyes and often a movement of the head, usually forwards. To <I><FONT color=brown>peer</FONT></I> may mean to <I><FONT color=brown>look</FONT></I> inquiringly or searchingly or may simply indicate difficulty in seeing clearly. [He <I><FONT color=brown>peered</FONT></I> surreptitiously into his wallet to see if he had enough money to pay the bill.

<P>These words denote the emotion which a person feels for someone or something. <B><FONT color=blue>Love</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>attachment</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>affection</FONT></B> are all general words which designate the kind of feeling that binds a person to another person or to a thing by ties of the heart or of the mind. <I><FONT color=brown>Love</FONT></I> goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I> and affection in intensity. Thus you would not speak of a mother’s <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I> to her baby but of her <I><FONT color=brown>affection</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>love</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Love</FONT></I> may also imply less control or regulation of feeling than <I><FONT color=brown>affection</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I> because it connotes the possible presence of passion in its make-up: His <I><FONT color=brown>love</FONT></I> for her, being based on physical attraction alone, could not withstand the boredom and jealousy that soon became part of it. <I><FONT color=brown>Attachment</FONT></I> sometimes suggests a warm liking: a fond <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I> to one’s pet. It can refer also to the kind of loyalty which is inspired by mental rather than emotional sympathies: he suffered from a profound <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I> to a cause which his judgement told him was honourable but which the prejudices of his upbringing rejected as radical and morally unsound. <I><FONT color=brown>Affection</FONT></I> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>attachment</FONT></I> in that it expresses a greater depth of sentiment and is almost always directed towards a living being: the cherished <I><FONT color=brown>affection</FONT></I> of a childhood friend.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crush</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>infatuation</FONT></B> are alike in denoting a special kind of <I><FONT color=brown>affection</FONT></I> or love. Both are absorbing, extravagant, often unreasoning and unreasonable sentiments, usually as temporary as they are intense. But, while one can have a <I><FONT color=brown>crush</FONT></I> on a person only, one can be <I><FONT color=brown>infatuated</FONT></I> with something inanimate: When he reached middle age, my father developed an <I><FONT color=brown>infatuation</FONT></I> for gambling. There is also a difference between crush and <I><FONT color=brown>infatuation</FONT></I> in that the former almost always designates the feelings of a young person and the latter those of someone more mature. [Jeannie’s <I><FONT color=brown>crush</FONT></I> this week is on her maths teacher; The old man’s <I><FONT color=brown>infatuation</FONT></I> with his nurse made her job so difficult that she asked to be taken off his case.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Emotion">EMOTION</A>, <A href="entry://Erotic">EROTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dislike">DISLIKE</A>, hate.</P>

loving
<B><FONT color=blue>loving</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>devoted</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>doting</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fond</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all convey the meaning of having a warm feeling towards or strong attachment to some person or thing. <B><FONT color=blue>Loving</FONT></B> is a broad word that refers to personal regard. It can be used in speaking of the regard itself or of the regard itself or of its outward indications: a <I><FONT color=brown>loving</FONT></I> couple; <I><FONT color=brown>loving</FONT></I> glances. It can describe a reserved emotion or one that is notable for its demonstration: <I><FONT color=brown>loving</FONT></I> parents who would rather risk their child’s displeasure than spoil him; a happy, <I><FONT color=brown>loving</FONT></I> child who seems to want nothing more than to kiss and hug anyone who comes near her.</P><P>A <I><FONT color=brown>loving</FONT></I> person whose feelings or demonstrations go beyond the bounds of good taste or good judgement is often described as <B><FONT color=blue>doting</FONT></B>: a <I><FONT color=brown>doting</FONT></I> lover whose foolish extravagances and emotional absurdities lost him his mistress; a <I><FONT color=brown>doting</FONT></I> mother who alienated her husband by lavishing too much love on their child.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Devoted</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>fond</FONT></B>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>loving</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>doting</FONT></I>, are used in reference to the feeling a person has towards some thing as well as towards another person. The difference between them in such usage is one of degree, <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> bespeaking a much greater amount of attachment to the thing involved: a student of the piano who is <I><FONT color=brown>fond</FONT></I> of all the romantics and especially <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> to Rachmaninoff. In characterizing emotion <I><FONT color=brown>directed</FONT></I> towards a person, <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> again is a stronger word than <I><FONT color=brown>fond</FONT></I> and often suggests the depth of feeling that results from time-tested loyalty: a couple who were nothing more than <I><FONT color=brown>fond</FONT></I> of each other when they married but who have grown into <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> lovers. <I><FONT color=brown>Devoted</FONT></I>, as no other word in the group does, can refer to the enthusiasm or ardour involved in an attachment which need not necessarily have any sentimental suggestions: <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> to his job; a <I><FONT color=brown>devoted</FONT></I> follower of Marxist philosophy.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Allegiance">ALLEGIANCE</A>, <A href="entry://Emotion">EMOTION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bitter, <A href="entry://Cold">COLD</A>, hateful.</P>

<P>These words refer to a soft radiance, mostly of reflected light. <B><FONT color=blue>Luminous</FONT></B> may describe a source of light, in which case it is very general, indicating the light’s brightness or clarity: <I><FONT color=brown>luminous</FONT></I> stars. Contradictorily enough, it can also specifically suggest a soft or barely perceivable radiance or one enclosed within or seen through something else: dim moonlight on <I><FONT color=brown>luminous</FONT></I> pine needles; the <I><FONT color=brown>luminous</FONT></I> dial of the radio. <B><FONT color=blue>Lucent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>lucid</FONT></B> share in these last meanings of <I><FONT color=brown>luminous</FONT></I>, suggesting particularly refracted of suffused light: the <I><FONT color=brown>lucent</FONT></I> pool of water; a <I><FONT color=brown>lucid</FONT></I>, cloudless day. Both, but especially lucid, suggest clarity as a carry-over from what is now their main use, to refer to transparence. <B><FONT color=blue>Lambent</FONT></B> also suggests a radiance of refracted light: the <I><FONT color=brown>lambent</FONT></I> fog surrounding the street lamps. It has a lyrical quality that suggests gentleness or beauty, but can seem over-elegant in some contexts. <B><FONT color=blue>Refulgent</FONT></B> is even more in danger of this possibility, to the point of seeming precious. It specifically indicates a reflected brightness: the <I><FONT color=brown>refulgent</FONT></I> clouds above the setting sun.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gleaming</FONT></B> may indicate a source of light, in which case it merely suggests brightness: <I><FONT color=brown>gleaming</FONT></I> sunlight. In this use, it seems more natural and less formal than luminous. More specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>gleaming</FONT></I> may suggest the brightness of reflected light: the new skyscraper’s <I><FONT color=brown>gleaming</FONT></I> wall of glass. Its overtones in this case are of spotlessness. <I><FONT color=brown>Gleaming</FONT></I> may also suggest obscurity: the daring shapes of fish, faintly <I><FONT color=brown>gleaming</FONT></I> in the depths below the boat. <B><FONT color=blue>Glistening</FONT></B> is almost exclusively restricted to reflected light; except for this, it compares to <I><FONT color=brown>gleaming</FONT></I>, but suggests in addition to dimness an undulating reflection or a most surface: <I><FONT color=brown>glistening</FONT></I> rain-drenched leaves. <B><FONT color=blue>Lustrous</FONT></B> suggests a more mellow reflected light than either <I><FONT color=brown>gleaming</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>glistening</FONT></I>, applying specifically to the soft shine of any smooth material: the <I><FONT color=brown>lustrous</FONT></I> gold of the wedding ring.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bright">BRIGHT</A>, <A href="entry://Sparkling">SPARKLING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dull, dusky, <A href="entry://Gloomy">GLOOMY</A>, obscure.</P>

<P>These words all mean to move furtively or stealthily, and all express an evident desire to stay hidden or unnoticed. <B><FONT color=blue>Lurk</FONT></B> can mean to lie hidden or to exist unnoticed or unsuspected: a snake <I><FONT color=brown>lurking</FONT></I> in the grass; What evil <I><FONT color=brown>lurks</FONT></I> in the hearts of men? But its most pertinent sense here is to move secretly or furtively, always with the implication of menace: assassins <I><FONT color=brown>lurking</FONT></I> among the crowd. The implied danger is often vague and ill-defined, which only increases the suggestion of menace: dark, shadowy figures <I><FONT color=brown>lurking</FONT></I> in alleyways.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Slink</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>creep</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>steal</FONT></B> all mean to move quietly or furtively, but, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>slink</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>creep</FONT></I> often suggest fear as a motive for remaining hidden, <I><FONT color=brown>steal</FONT></I> may suggest other motives. <I><FONT color=brown>Slink</FONT></I> often points to a sly, guilty or abject attitude, and suggests a cowering posture and a fairly rapid gait: The beggar, refused a hand-out, <I><FONT color=brown>slunk</FONT></I> away into the shadows. <I><FONT color=brown>Creep</FONT></I>, in its basic sense, means to move with the body close to or touching the ground: Commandos <I><FONT color=brown>creeping</FONT></I> through the undergrowth. As here considered, <I><FONT color=brown>creep</FONT></I> often suggests timidity or fear as a cause of slow, very deliberate movement, regardless of posture: We <I><FONT color=brown>crept</FONT></I> up the staircase, our hearts pounding. But it can also mean any slow movement: The train fairly <I><FONT color=brown>crept</FONT></I> along. <I><FONT color=brown>Steal</FONT></I> emphasizes the secrecy of a mission: He <I><FONT color=brown>stole</FONT></I> over to his friend’s locker when his back was turned and dropped a frog in his shoe. Both <I><FONT color=brown>steal</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>creep</FONT></I> can be used figuratively. [A note of pathos <I><FONT color=brown>crept</FONT></I> into her voice; For the first time a feeling of pity <I><FONT color=brown>stole</FONT></I> into his heart.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Skulk</FONT></B>, more than <I><FONT color=brown>slink</FONT></I>, suggests guilt or shame as a motive for passing unnoticed: For months after his release from prison, he <I><FONT color=brown>skulked</FONT></I> around the house, afraid to show his face during the day. But it may also suggest sober caution and, in still other contexts, menace: to <I><FONT color=brown>skulk</FONT></I> past a gang of street-corner louts; a tough waterfront neighbourhood with clusters of figures <I><FONT color=brown>skulking</FONT></I> in front of every bar. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>slink</FONT></I> or creep, <I><FONT color=brown>skulk</FONT></I> does not suggest any particular gait; it may imply the hunched-over posture of one wishing to remain undetected, but no mental picture is invariably associated with it. <B><FONT color=blue>Sneak</FONT></B> gives no clue at all either to posture or gait, thus emphasizing motive ?the wish to remain unnoticed ?to the exclusion of manner. <I><FONT color=brown>Sneak</FONT></I> can apply to trivial or innocent events as well as serious ones: to <I><FONT color=brown>sneak</FONT></I> into a circus tent; to sneak away from a party; to sneak into the kitchen for a snack. It suggests mischief or cowardliness more often than menace, and, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>lurk</FONT></I>, seldom or never suggests the threat of criminal acts.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Prowl</FONT></B> means to roam about stealthily in search of prey or plunder: lions <I><FONT color=brown>prowling</FONT></I> for gazelles. When applied to people, <I><FONT color=brown>prowl</FONT></I> can suggest danger or may emphasize only the predatory instinct: would-be bashers <I><FONT color=brown>prowling</FONT></I> for victims; young men <I><FONT color=brown>prowling</FONT></I> the streets (or on the prowl) for girls. <I><FONT color=brown>Prowl</FONT></I> car is a colloquialism for a police patrol car, so called because unless on call, it typically moves slowly and in a more or less random manner, as an animal would while searching for prey. Thus <I><FONT color=brown>prowl</FONT></I>, alone of these words, may suggest a beneficial motive for stealth.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Follow">FOLLOW</A>, <A href="entry://Hunt">HUNT</A>, <A href="entry://Stealthy">STEALTHY</A>.</P>

<P>These words relate to the turning out of finished products by the shaping or combination of raw materials or parts. <B><FONT color=blue>Make</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of these words and can apply to any process of construction: a child <I><FONT color=brown>making</FONT></I> a paper kite; factories that <I><FONT color=brown>make</FONT></I> thousands of ball-point pens each day. <B><FONT color=blue>Manufacture</FONT></B> is narrower in scope but can range from factual neutrality in tone to disapproval for mechanical or uncreative activity: industrialized nations that can <I><FONT color=brown>manufacture</FONT></I> their own machines and equipment; an artist who does make paintings so much as he <I><FONT color=brown>manufactures</FONT></I> them. <B><FONT color=blue>Produce</FONT></B> approaches the generality of make, and stresses the neutral aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>manufacture</FONT></I>. It emphasizes the amount of a product turned out, without necessarily implying a process of mass-production, as would be the case with <I><FONT color=brown>manufacture</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>producing</FONT></I> a new novel every two years; a region that has <I><FONT color=brown>produced</FONT></I> more Cabinet Ministers than any other area of the country; new methods that <I><FONT color=brown>produce</FONT></I> more crops from the same amount of land; a nation whose economy is tied to the amount of steel its mills produce each year. <B><FONT color=blue>Assemble</FONT></B>, more than the other words of this group, emphasizes the combining of parts which have been made somewhere else: waiting for a component to arrive from the manufacturer so that he could <I><FONT color=brown>assemble</FONT></I> his hi-fi-set.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Build">BUILD</A>, <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Mould">MOULD</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to say or to write something, often misleading or false, that is damaging to a person or a group of people. <B><FONT color=blue>Malign</FONT></B> is the broadest word in the group in that the feelings which motivate a person who <I><FONT color=brown>maligns</FONT></I> another can range from the simple ill will which prompts a gossip to the bitter hatred or malicious ignorance which results in pernicious persecution: a lady author who has been much <I><FONT color=brown>maligned</FONT></I> because of her romantic indiscretions; a local shopkeeper so <I><FONT color=brown>maligned</FONT></I> by a competitor that he was forced to sell out and move elsewhere.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Asperse</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vilify</FONT></B> imply false accusations made in order to ruin someone’s reputation. <I><FONT color=brown>Asperse</FONT></I>, meaning literally to bespatter, often implies indirect or vague assertions made to reduce good repute. <I><FONT color=brown>Vilify</FONT></I> usually implies violent and direct abuse, such as the calling of names. One may <I><FONT color=brown>asperse</FONT></I> a writer’s integrity by suggesting indirectly that he has written lies, or <I><FONT color=brown>vilify</FONT></I> him directly by calling him a liar. <I><FONT color=brown>Asperse</FONT></I>, however, is extremely formal, and more commonly appears in the form of a plural noun: The writer accused the reviewer of casting <I><FONT color=brown>aspersions</FONT></I> on his work.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Defame</FONT></B> can specifically indicate an attempt to destroy someone’s good name. Like <I><FONT color=brown>vilify</FONT></I>, the word suggests the use of direct and harsh accusations, but <I><FONT color=brown>defame</FONT></I> is less commonly used in this way than <I><FONT color=brown>vilify</FONT></I>. Recently, it has acquired a meaning that refers to unfounded, broadside denunciations of ethnic or religious groups: the myth of ritual murder that was repeatedly used to <I><FONT color=brown>defame</FONT></I> the Jewish minority in many European countries.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Libel</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>slander</FONT></B>, in their most restricted sense, are legal terms pertaining to defamation, which is the act of maliciously making a false and disparaging statement about a person, and which is closely defined in the relevant statutes and laws. In exact terms, <I><FONT color=brown>libel</FONT></I> refers to permanently recorded (written or printed) statement, and <I><FONT color=brown>slander</FONT></I> to spoken ones. In popular usages, however, both words are applied to false accusations by any means.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accuse">ACCUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Belittle">BELITTLE</A>, <A href="entry://Lie">LIE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things that can be moulded or bent. <B><FONT color=blue>Malleable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ductile</FONT></B> refer most specifically to the working of metals. <I><FONT color=brown>Malleable</FONT></I> indicates a metal, such as gold, that can be beaten easily into thin sheets or other forms at will. <I><FONT color=brown>Ductile</FONT></I> refers specifically to the ease with which a metal, such as copper, can be drawn out into a continuous wire; sometimes it can also refer to the readiness with which fluids will follow a given course. In this sense, water is more <I><FONT color=brown>ductile</FONT></I> than mercury. When these two words are used to describe responsive minds, malleable suggests an innocent or unformed character that easily takes an impression and can be decisively altered by the conscious attempts of another person or by propaganda: the age at which a normally <I><FONT color=brown>malleable</FONT></I> student is most open to influence, whether for good or ill. <I><FONT color=brown>Ductile</FONT></I> appears less commonly in this context; when it does, it suggests the capability of being subtly led towards a not always stated goal: a demagogue flattering his all too <I><FONT color=brown>ductile</FONT></I> audience.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pliable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pliant</FONT></B> are closely related. Used of physical objects, <I><FONT color=brown>pliant</FONT></I> often suggests something that resumes its shape after being bent: a <I><FONT color=brown>pliant</FONT></I> reed. <I><FONT color=brown>Pliable</FONT></I> is often used for something that will remain in any shape given to it: a <I><FONT color=brown>pliable</FONT></I> whip; <I><FONT color=brown>pliable</FONT></I> putty. When applied to character, consequently, <I><FONT color=brown>pliable</FONT></I> should suggest a greater openness to impression than <I><FONT color=brown>pliant</FONT></I>: half-truths purveyed to <I><FONT color=brown>pliable</FONT></I> minds; a readiness to learn that was <I><FONT color=brown>pliant</FONT></I> but not incredulous. Frequently, however, these words are used with no discernible difference in meanings.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Plastic</FONT></B> most often refers to any substance that can be moulded and then hardened or set: <I><FONT color=brown>plastic</FONT></I> buttons; a <I><FONT color=brown>plastic</FONT></I> safety helmet. But he word can refer to any synthesized substance, however, treated, that is initially a liquid or gel: <I><FONT color=brown>plastic</FONT></I> shower curtains. Because of its overriding use in these cases, other uses of the word may be losing ground. <I><FONT color=brown>Plastic</FONT></I> can refer to an impressionable mind when it is still mouldable, unformed, or not yet fixed: the first years of life when the psyche is at its most <I><FONT color=brown>plastic</FONT></I>. The word can also refer to the creative impulse in general or to sculptural or three-dimensional qualities: the poet’s <I><FONT color=brown>plastic</FONT></I> ability to find new forms for new subject matter; a building considered strictly as a set of <I><FONT color=brown>plastic</FONT></I> values; the unique <I><FONT color=brown>plastic</FONT></I> designs of the choreographer’s ensemble work.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adaptable">ADAPTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Compliant">COMPLIANT</A>, <A href="entry://Supple">SUPPLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: inflexible, intractable, recalcitrant, refractory, rigid, <A href="entry://Stubborn">STUBBORN</A>, unyielding.</P>

<P>These words refer to people taken as a group. <B><FONT color=blue>Mankind</FONT></B> points collectively to all people, past, present or future, as an entity about which statements can be made. The word can sometimes tend to sound high-flown or flowery, suggesting a context of formal rhetoric or solemn oratory; often the word functions as a personification that implies a unity of thought, action and sensibility that can be generalized from the contradictory and diverse actuality. Hence, the word may be used as a quasi-poetic or persuasive term rather than as a rendering of defensible or exact observation: arguing that <I><FONT color=brown>mankind</FONT></I> has always struggled forwards no matter what obstacles lay in its way; basing his politics on his view of <I><FONT color=brown>mankind</FONT></I> as insatiably greedy and intent on self-aggrandizement. The word can, of course, appear more neutrally without these liabilities: the cultures of <I><FONT color=brown>mankind</FONT></I>; a multi-volumed work attempting to take in the whole history of <I><FONT color=brown>mankind</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Humanity</FONT></B> can have the same high-toned flavour as mankind: <I><FONT color=brown>humanity</FONT></I> in its age-old struggle for survival. By implication, however, the word points more exclusively to favourable qualities such as compassion, understanding and the ennobling emotions: instincts of love and self-sacrifice that have always pervaded <I><FONT color=brown>humanity</FONT></I> in times of crisis. <I><FONT color=brown>Humanity</FONT></I>, in fact, can refer collectively to this bundle of ennobling or civilizing virtues, whether it is seen in a single person or in all people: a man of unmistakable sympathy and <I><FONT color=brown>humanity</FONT></I>; UNESCO’s attempt to show the common <I><FONT color=brown>humanity</FONT></I> expressed in all the cultures of the earth. <B><FONT color=blue>Homo sapiens</FONT></B> is a scientific term for <I><FONT color=brown>mankind</FONT></I> as the only surviving species of the genus Homo; the term would appear in biological or anthropological discussion, particularly in making distinctions between this species and other animals: the relation of <I><FONT color=brown>Homo sapiens</FONT></I> to the other primates. The term would sound affected in a more general context. <B><FONT color=blue>Man</FONT></B> can be used as a less formal or technical term in scientific discussion: studying the evolution of <I><FONT color=brown>man</FONT></I>. This word can also be used like the first two words, however, as a personification that includes all people of all times: <I><FONT color=brown>man’s</FONT></I> incessant temptation to solve his problems by using his fists instead of his brains.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Humankind</FONT></B>, the most formal of these words, can sound even more high-flown than the first pair of words. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>humanity</FONT></I>, however, it need not suggest only ennobling traits: the puerile attempts of <I><FONT color=brown>humankind</FONT></I> to understand the cosmos. Where <I><FONT color=brown>mankind</FONT></I> might be used to treat people collectively in narrative generalization, emphasizing a past-to-present progression, <I><FONT color=brown>humankind</FONT></I> lends itself to aphoristic statements about abiding traits, often stated in the historical present. [<I><FONT color=brown>Humankind</FONT></I> listens to the wisdom of its prophets once a week, but the bulletins of its warlords once an hour.] <B><FONT color=blue>Men</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>humankind</FONT></I> in tending to suggest a present-tense statement about the enduring qualities of people, good or bad: pointing out that <I><FONT color=brown>men</FONT></I> are the only animals that kill for pleasure. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>man</FONT></I>, this word would seldom be used in scientific discussion; both words, of course, include <I><FONT color=brown>women</FONT></I> in the implied grouping, but <I><FONT color=brown>men</FONT></I> as a collective is more ambiguous about this, since it can also be used as a collective for all human males, as well. <I><FONT color=brown>Men</FONT></I> is useful in historical discussion since it avoids the suggestion of personified unity implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>mankind</FONT></I>, applying where <I><FONT color=brown>mankind</FONT></I> cannot to point out diversity or conflict among people: the first attempts of <I><FONT color=brown>men</FONT></I> to settle disputes through reason rather than violence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Folk">FOLK</A>, <A href="entry://Kin">KIN</A>.</P>

<P>These words pertain to the use of attention-getting devices or to the adoption of insincere, artificial, forced or pretentious behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Mannerism</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>affection</FONT></B> both disapprovingly indicate an instance of such behaviour, but <I><FONT color=brown>mannerism</FONT></I> is the milder of the two words, suggesting a noticeable but minor oddity of gesture or speech that may be either deliberate or habitual: adopting a few British speech <I><FONT color=brown>mannerisms</FONT></I> because she thought they lent her a mark of distinction; He waved his hands about as he talked ?a nervous <I><FONT color=brown>mannerism</FONT></I> that he’d unconsciously picked up from his parents. Sometimes, the word can apply to any obtrusive stylistic device: coy <I><FONT color=brown>mannerisms</FONT></I> that mar her prose style. <I><FONT color=brown>Affectation</FONT></I> concentrates more exclusively on the deliberate adoption of anything that is ornate or pretentious: speech studded with faded poeticisms and other <I><FONT color=brown>affectations</FONT></I>; He thought it was an <I><FONT color=brown>affectation</FONT></I> nowadays to include finger bowls in the table settings. The word can also serve as an abstract collective for pretentiousness in general: Sincerity and simplicity are the archenemies of <I><FONT color=brown>affectation</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Air</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pose</FONT></B> can both indicate adopting a contrived appearance or manner in order to create an effect or to impress others: She walked with an <I><FONT color=brown>air</FONT></I> of haughty disdain past the other schoolchildren; his <I><FONT color=brown>pose</FONT></I> of being one of the world’s foremost authorities on contemporary art. Air might well suggest a momentary attempt to create a certain mood; as such, it is less disapproving than <I><FONT color=brown>pose</FONT></I>, which suggests greater contrivance and willingness to deceive. <I><FONT color=brown>Pose</FONT></I> can, in fact, extend to roles assumed by swindlers or extortionists: his <I><FONT color=brown>pose</FONT></I> of being a blind man, adopted to win the sympathy of his victims. Both words, but particularly <I><FONT color=brown>air</FONT></I>, can also refer not to deliberate role-playing but to the mood or impression that someone gives off: She faced us with an <I><FONT color=brown>air</FONT></I> of utter bewilderment; inadvertently discovering him pleading with his wife in a <I><FONT color=brown>pose</FONT></I> of genuine contrition.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Airs</FONT></B> refers exclusively to grandiose affectations that do not correspond to one’s real situation; the word’s use is mostly restricted to a few stock phrases: giving oneself <I><FONT color=brown>airs</FONT></I>; putting on <I><FONT color=brown>airs</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Preciosity</FONT></B> refers to striving after a rarefied refinement that might appeal to an arty or genteel coterie: stilted speech and an overall preciosity of manner. Often the word refers to artistic style or aesthetic taste: a <I><FONT color=brown>preciosity</FONT></I> that made him prefer the Pre-Raphaelite painters to Turner. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>exhibitionism</FONT></B> refers to any sort of attention-getting acts. By implication these may well constitute the very opposite of refinement by being loud, garish crude or obstreperous: muscle boys strutting and flexing their biceps in self-fascinated <I><FONT color=brown>exhibitionism</FONT></I>; the unruly <I><FONT color=brown>exhibitionism</FONT></I> of some habitués of the discothèque.

<P>These words refer to anything that has little bearing on a given question or that is slight in quantity or importance. <B><FONT color=blue>Marginal</FONT></B> and peripheral both point to a small degree of value, usefulness or importance: a <I><FONT color=brown>marginal</FONT></I> increase in pay. Of the two, only <I><FONT color=brown>marginal</FONT></I> can suggest something that an opposing force has almost but not quite cancelled out: a <I><FONT color=brown>marginal</FONT></I> profit once costs had been accounted for; <I><FONT color=brown>marginal</FONT></I> culture traits left by an incomplete assimilation into the cultural majority. <B><FONT color=blue>Peripheral</FONT></B> is more restricted to something that may be important in itself but is not relevant to a given situation: the Maori tribal wars being of <I><FONT color=brown>peripheral</FONT></I> concern to that period of New Zealand history. Both of these words can, of course, indicate something that is distant from a centre or lies at the edge of some entity: a book filled with <I><FONT color=brown>marginal</FONT></I> notations; <I><FONT color=brown>peripheral</FONT></I> vision.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Negligible</FONT></B> adds to the general possibilities of the previous pair a particular implication of a slight amount, something so small that it can be safely ignored: arguing that only a <I><FONT color=brown>negligible</FONT></I> rise in atmospheric radioactivity resulted from the test; a <I><FONT color=brown>negligible</FONT></I> variation that could not affect the outcome of the experiment. <B><FONT color=blue>Piddling</FONT></B> is a much more informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>negligible</FONT></I>, concentrating more exclusively on amount or value, particularly monetary: a <I><FONT color=brown>piddling</FONT></I> allowance. But it can also refer more vaguely as invective to weak arguments or to anything thought to be insignificant: a <I><FONT color=brown>piddling</FONT></I> explanation; a <I><FONT color=brown>piddling</FONT></I> second lieutenant.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>inconsequential</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>minor</FONT></B> concentrate mainly on a lack of importance. <I><FONT color=brown>Inconsequential</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>negligible</FONT></I>, can indicate a lack of relevance: an <I><FONT color=brown>inconsequential</FONT></I> objection to our plan. But it can function explicitly as indicating a lack of power or social status: an <I><FONT color=brown>inconsequential</FONT></I> person. <I><FONT color=brown>Minor</FONT></I> may function similarly to other words here, but unlike them it can point to something of considerably greater importance, though such a thing would still remain clearly subsidiary, secondary or subordinate to a main point or concern: any combination of <I><FONT color=brown>minor</FONT></I> failings that could yet add up to disaster; separating those important Elizabethan poets, major and <I><FONT color=brown>minor</FONT></I>, from those of <I><FONT color=brown>marginal</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>negligible</FONT></I> interest, while ignoring completely those who have proved to be totally <I><FONT color=brown>inconsequential</FONT></I>.</P><P>All the preceding words emphasize a relative slightness of quantity or importance. <B><FONT color=blue>Nugatory</FONT></B> is the one word here that emphatically stresses an absolute and unqualified lack, in this case of worth or meaning: avantgarde experiments with language that were <I><FONT color=brown>nugatory</FONT></I> both in sense and influence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deficient">DEFICIENT</A>, <A href="entry://Extraneous">EXTRANEOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Scanty">SCANTY</A>, <A href="entry://Trivial">TRIVIAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to stretches of land in which soil and water, often stagnant, are intermingled with no clear demarcations, a situation that results in unstable footing or presents resistance to navigation. <B><FONT color=blue>Marsh</FONT></B> indicates a shallow, stagnant expanse of standing water enclosed by wet and treacherous soil: a track that swooped in a wide circle to avoid the <I><FONT color=brown>marsh</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Swamp</FONT></B> suggests a large <I><FONT color=brown>marsh</FONT></I> that has some patches mainly of wet soil and others mainly of muddy water: They pushed through the <I><FONT color=brown>swamp</FONT></I> in a flat-bottomed boat, but frequently had to get out and drag the boat. Both <I><FONT color=brown>marsh</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>swamp</FONT></I> may suggest the presence of vegetation such as grass or even trees; <I><FONT color=brown>swamp</FONT></I>, particularly, might suggest an almost impassable overgrowth: an impenetrable mangrove <I><FONT color=brown>swamp</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fen</FONT></B> specifically suggests a <I><FONT color=brown>swamp</FONT></I> overgrown with vegetation and filled with fetid water, but the word is not commonly used here. [Hereward the Wake’s stronghold in the <I><FONT color=brown>fens</FONT></I> of Ely.] <B><FONT color=blue>Morass</FONT></B> indicates low-lying, soft, wet ground in which one can be easily mired, and is now more often used metaphorically for entangling complications into which it is easy to be drawn but from which it is difficult to escape, once involved: a <I><FONT color=brown>morass</FONT></I> of work that threatened to overwhelm him.</P><P>The remaining words all suggest a marsh or swamp that has a specific locale and a particular set of topographic features. <B><FONT color=blue>Everglade</FONT></B>, used mostly in the United States, points to a low-lying subtropical <I><FONT color=brown>swamp</FONT></I> covered with tall grass: the Florida <I><FONT color=brown>Everglades</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Bayou</FONT></B>, also American, indicates a <I><FONT color=brown>marshy</FONT></I> inlet or outlet of a lake or river; its root is a Louisiana French word borrowed from the Choctaw Indian word for a small stream: the <I><FONT color=brown>bayous</FONT></I> of the Mississippi delta. <B><FONT color=blue>Paddy</FONT></B> comes from the Malay, referring to flooded lowlands in the Orient where rice is grown: peasants working in the terraced rice <I><FONT color=brown>paddies</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Bog</FONT></B> is dawn from an Irish word for soft, referring to wet, spongy soil that is overgrown with grass: peat <I><FONT color=brown>bogs</FONT></I> from which the Irish harvested a fuel for heating and cooking. <I><FONT color=brown>Bog</FONT></I> is the only one of these localized words that can apply more widely. In this case, it refers to soft, wet soil that provides only treacherous footing and from which it is difficult to extricate oneself; the metaphorical implications here are more clearly seen in the word’s verbal form: <I><FONT color=brown>bogged</FONT></I> down in another useless man-to-man talk with his father.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Plain">PLAIN</A> (n.).</P>

<P>These words refer to characteristics that ideally or appropriately pertain to men. <B><FONT color=blue>Masculine</FONT></B> may refer, most neutrally, to what is true for men in general, as distinguished from women: a <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> tendency to defer to women on such subjects.

In this context, the word can suggest, as well, an excess of qualities normally exhibited by men: wondering if she were expected to fall over in a faint at the <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> charm he exuded. The word can also refer to women, with either a neutral or pejorative tone: those women’s fashions that have taken on an increasingly <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> look; a woman rather <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> in appearance.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Manly</FONT></B> is more restricted than <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> an applying exclusively to desirable qualities that approach those thought ideally <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I>: a manly determination to fight back at his oppressor; a trim, <I><FONT color=brown>manly</FONT></I> body. It would never refer to men in general, to <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> excesses, or to women, whether neutrally or pejoratively. <B><FONT color=blue>Male</FONT></B> may be used, of course, merely in classification, pertaining as well to species other than human: a <I><FONT color=brown>male</FONT></I> dog; the contrast between <I><FONT color=brown>male</FONT></I> and female voting patterns; <I><FONT color=brown>male</FONT></I> hormones. Beyond this use, the word functions very like <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> at a more informal level: <I><FONT color=brown>male</FONT></I> attitudes that once excluded women from participation in public affairs; a perfect example of <I><FONT color=brown>male</FONT></I> stupidity. The word may be factual in qualifying something typically thought the province of women: a <I><FONT color=brown>male</FONT></I> nurse. It is less likely than <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> to be used for unfeminine women when the word evaluates men, its emphasis is not so much on an attained ideal as with <I><FONT color=brown>manly</FONT></I>, but on qualities that are intensely evocative of masculine sexuality: the coarse, <I><FONT color=brown>male</FONT></I> attractiveness of her rescuer. <B><FONT color=blue>Virile</FONT></B> is exclusively restricted to this last implication of <I><FONT color=brown>male</FONT></I>, emphasizing strength either of mind or body, but especially of sexual potency: She liked a man who felt <I><FONT color=brown>virile</FONT></I> enough to dispense with the usual masculine arrogance she found so tedious. <I><FONT color=brown>Manly</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>virile</FONT></I>, in comparisons, might suggest a contrast between appearance and performance: husbands who appear <I><FONT color=brown>manly</FONT></I> enough but are not really very <I><FONT color=brown>virile</FONT></I>.</P><P>Just as <I><FONT color=brown>virile</FONT></I> is positive and applies exclusively to men. So <B><FONT color=blue>mannish</FONT></B> applies in an exclusive and negative way to women. The word is, thus, more heavily shaded towards the pejorative than <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> in referring to inappropriately male aspects in women: her square, <I><FONT color=brown>mannish</FONT></I> build; women’s fashions that take over <I><FONT color=brown>masculine</FONT></I> styles without ridding them of their <I><FONT color=brown>mannish</FONT></I> appearance.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Husky">HUSKY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Feminine">FEMININE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things of overwhelming size, scale or weigh. Most concretely, <B><FONT color=blue>massive</FONT></B> indicates a large mass, bulk or weight: a <I><FONT color=brown>massive</FONT></I> boulder. Weight or bulk need not be implied, however, when the word points instead to something that is imposing or impressive in scale, scope, degree or intensity: a <I><FONT color=brown>massive</FONT></I> painting; a decision that was to have <I><FONT color=brown>massive</FONT></I> consequences throughout the succeeding century. In a medical sense, the word points to something extending over or affecting a large area: <I><FONT color=brown>massive</FONT></I> swelling.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ponderous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>hefty</FONT></B> are more restricted than massive in that both echo the stress on weight but put less emphasis on sheer size. Relatively formal, <I><FONT color=brown>ponderous</FONT></I> points to heaviness that may be unwieldy or unbearable: pyramids made of <I><FONT color=brown>ponderous</FONT></I> stones that had to be inched into place. More often the word is used abstractly of something over-serious or solemn to the point of dullness: a <I><FONT color=brown>ponderous</FONT></I> lecture on the growing immorality of present-day society. The word can also suggest a heavy sort of physical movement that is slow, tortuous or lumbering: shuffling forwards with a <I><FONT color=brown>ponderous</FONT></I> gait. Relatively informal, <I><FONT color=brown>hefty</FONT></I> can refer more readily to physical heaviness, as of a physique: a <I><FONT color=brown>hefty</FONT></I> weight-lifter. Its unique area of relevance is to something that is heavy but meant to be picked up and carried: grunting as he lifted the <I><FONT color=brown>hefty</FONT></I> suitcase.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Huge</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>enormous</FONT></B> contrast with the previous words in stressing sheer size more than heaviness per se. In this sense, both can serve as superlatives for large, with <I><FONT color=brown>enormous</FONT></I> being the more formal of the two. In itself, huge may suggest a looming tallness or largeness of frame: the <I><FONT color=brown>huge</FONT></I> football player; the <I><FONT color=brown>huge</FONT></I> balloon that they inflated for the aerial show. <I><FONT color=brown>Enormous</FONT></I> suggests extension in space on a scale that goes beyond the implications of <I><FONT color=brown>huge</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>huge</FONT></I> man dwarfed by the <I><FONT color=brown>enormous</FONT></I> room. Both words can be used metaphorically for something serious, critical or urgent: the <I><FONT color=brown>huge</FONT></I> problems that must be faced if the population explosion is to be checked; <I><FONT color=brown>enormous</FONT></I> questions that remain to be answered. <I><FONT color=brown>Enormous</FONT></I>, however, may carry implications over from the word enormity in the sense of something abnormal, grotesque or outrageous: <I><FONT color=brown>enormous</FONT></I> crimes committed in the name of justice.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Immense</FONT></B> is like the previous pair in stressing size more than weight; where it refers to material masses, the word suggests something dramatically or surprisingly of large scale: an <I><FONT color=brown>immense</FONT></I> statue, a hundred times life size. But the word frequently stresses, like <I><FONT color=brown>enormous</FONT></I>, extension in space, rather than mass: early explorers who got lost in the <I><FONT color=brown>immense</FONT></I>, uncharted Atlantic. Often, the word relates to totally non-material or spiritual entities, with the implication of proportions so great as to swallow up things of normal scale: the <I><FONT color=brown>immense</FONT></I> void between the Milky Way and its nearest galactic neighbour. <B><FONT color=blue>Vast</FONT></B> concentrates exclusively on extension in space, with a complete absence of implications pertaining to weight or even to measurable or definable size: the <I><FONT color=brown>vast</FONT></I> emptiness of the unending desert. In comparison with <I><FONT color=brown>immense</FONT></I>, which can suggest three-dimensional largeness, <I><FONT color=brown>vast</FONT></I> more readily suggests two-dimensional extension: the <I><FONT color=brown>immense</FONT></I> volume enclosed by the cathedral’s domed nave; the <I><FONT color=brown>vast</FONT></I> lawns surrounding Government House.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Heavy">HEAVY</A>, <A href="entry://Husky">HUSKY</A>, <A href="entry://Large">LARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Size">SIZE</A>, <A href="entry://Tremendous">TREMENDOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Minute">MINUTE</A>, <A href="entry://Small">SMALL</A>, <A href="entry://Thin">THIN</A>.</P>

mature
<B><FONT color=blue>mature</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>age</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>develop</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mellow</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ripen</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the process of growing up or growing old. Mature is the most formal of these; in its most restricted sense, it indicates the natural attainment by a living thing of its adult or fullest form. [Caterpillars eventually mature into butterflies; Boys mature more slowly than girls, both physically and psychologically.] Outside this strict but neutral reference, the word can register approval for the gaining of wisdom, experience or sophistication, particularly when this process is not necessarily inevitable: childhood hardships that matured in him a precocious sense of responsibility.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Age</FONT></B>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>mature</FONT></I>, need not refer to fruition or tempering; instead, it more often refers to the changes that result from the mere passage of time: a study of how body tissue <I><FONT color=brown>ages</FONT></I>. The word can often, in fact, refer to negative or destructive changes that occur as a living thing grows old: lines and wrinkles that revealed how much she had <I><FONT color=brown>aged</FONT></I> since I saw her last. <I><FONT color=brown>Mature</FONT></I> is sometimes euphemistically substituted for age in this sense, as though the former’s positive reference to fruition might soften the latter’s presumed harshness in suggesting declining vigour: She had <I><FONT color=brown>matured</FONT></I> into a lovely grandmother. <I><FONT color=brown>Age</FONT></I>, however, can apply to man-made products with favourable force: whisky that has been properly <I><FONT color=brown>aged</FONT></I>. Here, it suggests valuable or desirable qualities that only time can impart. When applied to inanimate objects in general, <I><FONT color=brown>age</FONT></I> applies less positively to the attrition resulting from time’s passage: unpainted houses that had <I><FONT color=brown>aged</FONT></I> because of decades of exposure to the elements.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Develop</FONT></B> is more like the first sense of mature in pointing to positive change in which an existing or rudimentary form is improved, evolved or perfected. In referring to normal biological growth and change, the word can apply more generally than mature, since it can be used to refer to a part as well as a whole organism, and can indicate less ambiguously other transitions than the one culminating in adulthood. [When the breasts begin to <I><FONT color=brown>develop</FONT></I>, girls are already well on their way to maturing into young women; The foetus <I><FONT color=brown>develops</FONT></I> lungs relatively late in the gestation period.] When the word does not refer to predicable biological change, it is more general in application, most often referring either to the improvement or detailed elaboration of something: He joined a gym to <I><FONT color=brown>develop</FONT></I> his body; a committee set up to <I><FONT color=brown>develop</FONT></I> a programme for dealing effectively with air pollution.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mellow</FONT></B> concentrates on aspects of <I><FONT color=brown>mature</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>age</FONT></I> that pertain to the tempering imparted by time or experience. The word specifically suggests a reduction in harshness or the moderating of an extreme position: As they <I><FONT color=brown>mature</FONT></I>, many young radicals <I><FONT color=brown>mellow</FONT></I> into a more tolerant attitude towards life and society. In this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>mellow</FONT></I> is more positive than <I><FONT color=brown>mature</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>age</FONT></I>, since it gives overtones of glowing warmth, mildness and amiability. <B><FONT color=blue>Ripen</FONT></B> is a less formal and more vivid term for <I><FONT color=brown>mature</FONT></I>, with the same reference to the attainment by something of its final or most <I><FONT color=brown>developed</FONT></I> form. At its most literal, the word applies to fruit, describing the process that brings it to its most usable or edible: applies that were green a week <I><FONT color=brown>ago</FONT></I> have already <I><FONT color=brown>ripened</FONT></I>. Metaphorically, the word often refers to the filling out or enlarging of a spatial form: the girl’s <I><FONT color=brown>ripening</FONT></I> body. Used in a more general way in reference to people, the word often suggests not the attainment of adulthood but a <I><FONT color=brown>mellowing</FONT></I> process in later life; here the word often points to a gain in wisdom, like one sense of <I><FONT color=brown>mature</FONT></I>, but is in less danger of being felt as euphemistic: Rembrandt slowly <I><FONT color=brown>ripened</FONT></I> into a command of the insights typical of his last great phase. Sometimes the word more simply refers to any sort of increase or growth: The reader’s interest is sure to <I><FONT color=brown>ripen</FONT></I> as he gets deeper into this new suspense novel.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Finish">FINISH</A>, FULL-FLEDGED, <A href="entry://Old">OLD</A>, <A href="entry://Perfect">PERFECT</A>, <A href="entry://Reach">REACH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: regress.</P>

<P>These nouns refer to the ideas conveyed by words, phrases, symbols, actions or events. <B><FONT color=blue>Meaning</FONT></B> has the widest range of use, embracing everything from specific, concrete denotation to a general suggestiveness. The <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> of a word, sign or symbol is the idea it expresses, the object it designates or the concept it conveys. Words may have both literal and figurative meanings, both of which can be expressed in definitions, but the meaning of a word in any given instance often depends upon the context in which the word id used. In less restricted usage, <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> may apply to anything expressed as a message or intent, whether verbally or in some other fashion: to look for an artist’s <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> in his paintings. <I><FONT color=brown>Meaning</FONT></I> may also apply to motivation, purpose, consequence or even justification. [We debated the <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> of his strange behaviour; What is the <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> of this intrusion?; the real <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> of the Common Market.] Finally, in its most abstract, connotative use, <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> simply indicates expressiveness, pointing to the presence of valuable insights or important intimations without specifying what they are. [His speech struck them as being full of <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I>, in contrast to the hollow proclamations of the others.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Signification</FONT></B> relates to specific meaning. It points to an official or agreed-upon meaning, one recognized and understood by all who are acquainted with a certain word, term or symbol: the <I><FONT color=brown>significations</FONT></I> of standard abbreviations such as lb. And oz.; the <I><FONT color=brown>signification</FONT></I> of heraldic bearings on a coat of arms; the legal <I><FONT color=brown>signification</FONT></I> of the word "incompetent." <B><FONT color=blue>Sense</FONT></B> compares with meaning in a broad as well as a narrow application. It often pints to different kinds of use or interpretation, implying that a word has two or more <I><FONT color=brown>meanings</FONT></I> or ranges of meaning, or that a text has two or more levels of meaning: a punster playing on widely different <I><FONT color=brown>senses</FONT></I> of the same word; the symbolic <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> of Moby Dick. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>signification</FONT></I>, which is confined to a fixed <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> may indicate a connotation or understanding: He is a liberal in the best <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> of the word. It may also refer to an overall <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> or impression: to get the <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> of an article written in a foreign language, even though some of the words may be unfamiliar. Something that makes <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> conveys a clear, understandable or logical <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Import</FONT></B> is a less clear-cut than <I><FONT color=brown>signification</FONT></I>, indicating an intended <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> that may need interpretation. More than <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I>, it indicates the grasping of an idea, pointing to someone’s understanding of what has been suggested or expressed. [He stated the <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> of the passage in a paraphrase; Commentators explained the <I><FONT color=brown>import</FONT></I> of the Governor-General’s speech; She guessed the <I><FONT color=brown>import</FONT></I> of her friend’s long silence.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Implication</FONT></B> applies to meaning that may have been hinted at but that has not been actually stated or expressed in so many words. It emphasizes suggestiveness, referring almost exclusively to debatable possibilities of interpretation inherent in a statement, act or situation. <I><FONT color=brown>Implication</FONT></I> is thus not nearly so certain as <I><FONT color=brown>import</FONT></I>, contrasting even more strongly with the precision and definiteness of <I><FONT color=brown>signification</FONT></I>. Nevertheless, the <I><FONT color=brown>implications</FONT></I> of a thing, read rightly, may be far more important to a proper understanding of it than its literal or surface meaning. [He was pleasant and polite, but the sinister <I><FONT color=brown>implications</FONT></I> of is remarks were not lost on his audience; She misinterpreted the <I><FONT color=brown>implications</FONT></I> of his letter and thus misunderstood his intentions.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Significance</FONT></B> is akin to meaning in its wider <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I>. It mingles meaning and importance, referring to the underlying ideas or implications that give to words, deeds, symbols or events a special relevance. [His remarks were fraught with <I><FONT color=brown>significance</FONT></I>, but few gathered their full import.] <I><FONT color=brown>Significance</FONT></I> may also be used in a specific <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I>, suggesting a need to determine which of several possibilities is most relevant. [The <I><FONT color=brown>meaning</FONT></I> of their statement refusing to negotiate was never in any doubt; Its <I><FONT color=brown>import</FONT></I> of cooler relations between the two countries is also plain; But what <I><FONT color=brown>significance</FONT></I>, if any, do you place on the statement’s mildness of tone?]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hint">HINT</A>, <A href="entry://Mean">MEAN</A>, <A href="entry://Symbol">SYMBOL</A>.</P>

<P>These words describe someone who involves himself, without invitation, in the affairs of others, or who hampers them with unwelcome attentions. <B><FONT color=blue>Meddlesome</FONT></B> can suggest either of these situations; if the former, unwarranted curiosity is implied; if the latter, a self-important insistence on giving advice is masked as helpfulness: not able to tell her what had happened until their <I><FONT color=brown>meddlesome</FONT></I> neighbour had left; forcing upon them in the most <I><FONT color=brown>meddlesome</FONT></I> way peremptory advice about their trip. <B><FONT color=blue>Interfering</FONT></B> makes no reference to curiosity, but otherwise is close to <I><FONT color=brown>meddlesome</FONT></I>, except that it is more neutral and may suggest a less disagreeable or self-righteous approach. [A well-intentioned but <I><FONT color=brown>interfering</FONT></I> fiend is better than a meddlesome mother-in-law.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Prying</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>snoopy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>nosy</FONT></B> stress offensive curiosity to the exclusion of other meanings. The extremely informal <I><FONT color=brown>snoopy</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>nosy</FONT></I> can suggest an avidity for spying on others, gathering gossip or soliciting private information by posing leading questions. <I><FONT color=brown>Snoopy</FONT></I> may suggest a sneaky or stealthy approach in acquiring information: a <I><FONT color=brown>snoopy</FONT></I> landlady looking through her boarders?cupboards while they are out; a <I><FONT color=brown>snoopy</FONT></I> child, always eavesdropping. <I><FONT color=brown>Nosy</FONT></I> may indicate more forthright methods, quite literally suggesting the act of sticking one’s nose into someone else’s business: <I><FONT color=brown>nosy</FONT></I> neighbourhood gossips. The more formal <I><FONT color=brown>prying</FONT></I>, however, goes further than either of these to suggest an absolute violation of privacy by any means whatever: <I><FONT color=brown>prying</FONT></I> questions.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Officious</FONT></B> is now generally taken to refer to someone who, unasked, bustles about making arrangements, volunteering advice, offering unwanted services or giving orders exactly as though he were discharging official duties. This meaning gives the word a degree of specificness none of its synonyms posses: a very <I><FONT color=brown>officious</FONT></I> woman, so bossy that no one could abide her.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intrusive</FONT></B> may suggest a pushing oneself in where one is not wanted, or may point to undue curiosity: an <I><FONT color=brown>intrusive</FONT></I> guest, arriving uninvited, breaking in upon their solitude. [She had always lived with them but was never <I><FONT color=brown>intrusive</FONT></I> in any way; Unknowingly <I><FONT color=brown>intrusive</FONT></I>, he had a knack of asking embarrassing personal questions.] <B><FONT color=blue>Obtrusive</FONT></B> is applied to a person who disrupts other people’s affairs, either by calling attention to himself or by making self-aggrandizing suggestions or <I><FONT color=brown>officious</FONT></I> offers that are offensive and unwelcome. Where <I><FONT color=brown>intrusive</FONT></I> emphasizes the fact of a breach of privacy or other interruptive influence, <I><FONT color=brown>obtrusive</FONT></I> implies a loud, brusque or unduly obvious way of butting in: maintaining a silent watchfulness that dampened the discussion with its <I><FONT color=brown>intrusive</FONT></I> disapproval; a member who disrupted the meeting constantly with <I><FONT color=brown>obtrusive</FONT></I> remarks and catcalls.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Effrontery">EFFRONTERY</A>, <A href="entry://Encroach">ENCROACH</A>, <A href="entry://Overhear">OVERHEAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: incurious, inobtrusive, unobtrusive, unofficious.</P>

mediate
<B><FONT color=blue>mediate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>intercede</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>interpose</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>intervene</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to attempts to come between, reconcile or compromise opposing extremes. <B><FONT color=blue>Mediate</FONT></B> is the most general of these, carrying the most overtones of meaning. The word refers to any attempt to bring extremes together or to function as a form of communication between them: <I><FONT color=brown>mediating</FONT></I> between labour and management in the dispute. In this example, the implication is that the intermediary can advise or show good will but not demand or order a settlement of differences. <I><FONT color=brown>Mediate</FONT></I> can also be applied to the divisive disagreement itself or to its resolution: to <I><FONT color=brown>mediate</FONT></I> a dispute by seeking to find a middle ground on which the disputants can agree; to <I><FONT color=brown>mediate</FONT></I> a compromise settlement. In another use, <I><FONT color=brown>mediate</FONT></I> may simply indicate the occupying of a midway position between extremes: stable countries that have a sizeable middle class to <I><FONT color=brown>mediate</FONT></I> between the extremes of wealth and poverty. The word may also be used of something that acts solely as a link or communicating agent: a church that <I><FONT color=brown>mediates</FONT></I> between God and man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intercede</FONT></B> stresses a coming forward to stop a dispute in progress from continuing or getting worse, although it does not necessarily suggest that such action will solve the dispute: asking the Government to <I><FONT color=brown>intercede</FONT></I> in the crippling transport strike. Often the word is used to suggest a third party’s being drawn into an argument in order to plead for one side or the other: asking the Queen to <I><FONT color=brown>intercede</FONT></I> on his behalf.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Interpose</FONT></B> is sharply in contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>mediate</FONT></I> in that it suggests a blockage of communication between two hostile forces. It resembles <I><FONT color=brown>intercede</FONT></I> in that no solution need be applied, but the suggestion of stalemate is stronger: an international police force that could be <I><FONT color=brown>interposed</FONT></I> along the borders between two hostile nations. Again, like <I><FONT color=brown>intercede</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>interpose</FONT></I> may indicate entrance into a dispute on behalf of one side, although in this case the act is limited, by implication, to defence: enabling the courts to <I><FONT color=brown>interpose</FONT></I> themselves between an unjust law and the rights of any individual threatened by that law.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intervene</FONT></B> contrast with these other words by suggesting from the outset a more self-interested attitude in disrupting a dispute, usually to favour one side or another. The word would not be likely to refer to a mere stoppage, but does often suggest an intensification of hostilities: a nation refusing to <I><FONT color=brown>intervene</FONT></I> in the Vietnam war, though its sympathies lay with the South. As in the last example, the word can often suggest an unwanted meddling in other people’s business, and thus can impart a pejorative tone.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Insert">INSERT</A>, <A href="entry://Judge">JUDGE</A>.</P>

Calling a performance of a play <I><FONT color=brown>mediocre</FONT></I> means that the performance was neither very good nor very bad, but suggests that one had expected it to be better. <I><FONT color=brown>Mediocre</FONT></I>, then like the rest of these words, is a relative term; and it may, like most of the others, be preceded by a qualifying adverb, such as only or just, to emphasize its disparaging implications. [Considering her reputation as a gourmet, the dinner she served was only <I><FONT color=brown>mediocre</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ordinary</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>commonplace</FONT></B> are probably closet to <I><FONT color=brown>mediocre</FONT></I> in meaning, but <I><FONT color=brown>ordinary</FONT></I> is broader in application and usually expresses a somewhat less severe judgement. [How was the book? Nothing very exciting, just <I><FONT color=brown>ordinary</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Ordinary</FONT></I> can also mean simply uneventful, in which case it connotes no disparagement at all: an <I><FONT color=brown>ordinary</FONT></I> summer day, with a cloudless sky and the hum of insects in the air. <I><FONT color=brown>Commonplace</FONT></I> stresses the disparity between one’s expectation of originality or uniqueness and the disappointingly ordinary or vulgar reality. It often expresses the haughtiness or arrogance of one who has high standards or a keenly critical attitude. [It was a <I><FONT color=brown>commonplace</FONT></I> observation ?anyone might have made it.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fair</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>so-so</FONT></B> are close synonyms. Both occur rather more often in speech than in writing, and are thus somewhat more informal in tone than mediocre and ordinary. Depending on the context (or tone of voice with which they are uttered), <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>so-so</FONT></I> can range from cautious approval to moderate disgust. They are often deliberately used in a non-committal way, as to conceal bad news or a low opinion, often out of politeness or from the wish to keep one’s own affairs private. [How do you feel now, after your operation? Oh, <I><FONT color=brown>so-so</FONT></I>; How did you like the book I lent you? It was pretty <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Fair</FONT></I> is also used as a rank in a grading scale: excellent, good, <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I>, poor.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Passable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tolerable</FONT></B> are both examples of damning with faint praise. <I><FONT color=brown>Passable</FONT></I> suggests bare adequacy; it expresses the attitude indicated by a shrug of the shoulders and the comment, "Well things could be worse." If something is <I><FONT color=brown>passable</FONT></I>, one is simply forced to make do with it out of necessity rather than choice. [She didn’t really like the hat, but it was <I><FONT color=brown>passable</FONT></I>, and it couldn’t be exchanged; The film was just <I><FONT color=brown>passable</FONT></I> ?there were one or two good scenes, but the acting was bad and the plot fell apart near the end.] <I><FONT color=brown>Tolerable</FONT></I> has a wider range of meaning than <I><FONT color=brown>passable</FONT></I>. While it may mean barely adequate, it does not always emphasizes barely, as <I><FONT color=brown>passable</FONT></I> does, but may in fact emphasize adequate. [It was a <I><FONT color=brown>tolerable</FONT></I> salary, one you could live on if you knew how to keep a budget.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Second-rate</FONT></B>, especially when opposed to first-rate, is the most obviously derogatory of the words in this group; but when it is used in a scale of values that includes even lower categories, it has milder meaning. [It’s a good <I><FONT color=brown>second-rate</FONT></I> school, strong in some departments and weak in others, but certainly better than a great many other schools in this area.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: distinctive, <A href="entry://Excellent">EXCELLENT</A>, fine, good, original, <A href="entry://Outstanding">OUTSTANDING</A>, superior, <A href="entry://Unparalleled">UNPARALLELED</A>, <A href="entry://Unusual">UNUSUAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words are used to refer to the coming together of a number of people. <B><FONT color=blue>Meeting</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gathering</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>conference</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>assembly</FONT></B> are the most general and informal. As listed, these four words form a gradual progression towards greater specificness and formality. <I><FONT color=brown>Meeting</FONT></I> can aplay to every situation in which two or more people come together, by accident or design, for an encounter, whether momentary or prolonged. It can range in application from trivial or everyday situations to the most portentous or official occasions: the weekly <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> of the Scouts; a summit <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> of the heads of state. <I><FONT color=brown>Gathering</FONT></I> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> in its specific reference to a group of more than two people; it is like <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> in other respects, including its wideness of application: a chance <I><FONT color=brown>gathering</FONT></I> of people in the bar of the hotel; the annual <I><FONT color=brown>gathering</FONT></I> of the clan. <I><FONT color=brown>Conference</FONT></I> has more formality than either of the foregoing; but, like <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I>, it can imply a group of two people as well as of more: a <I><FONT color=brown>conference</FONT></I> with my adviser; the proposed disarmament <I><FONT color=brown>conference</FONT></I> at Geneva. <I><FONT color=brown>Assembly</FONT></I> distinctly implies a <I><FONT color=brown>gathering</FONT></I> of many people and tends to suggest a planned <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> more than an unplanned one: the school’s weekly assembly. It is also sometimes used specifically to designate a house of Parliament, usually the lower house in a Parliament with two houses, to which the formal term Legislative <I><FONT color=brown>Assembly</FONT></I> is often applied. [The upper house appointed a committee to examine a bill which the <I><FONT color=brown>Assembly</FONT></I> had already passed; The gathering of reporters in the corridors was tense and restless as the committee met for its first <I><FONT color=brown>conference</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Assemblage</FONT></B>, used as an exact synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>assembly</FONT></I>, would sound archaic. Even more important, it is often used currently in pejorative sense: an <I><FONT color=brown>assemblage</FONT></I> of hypocrites and incompetents.</P><P>The remaining words of this group are similar in being more specific than the previous words and very much more formal as well. <B><FONT color=blue>Conclave</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>congregation</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>convocation</FONT></B> refer primarily to religious <I><FONT color=brown>assemblies</FONT></I>, though they can extend to other kinds of <I><FONT color=brown>meetings</FONT></I> as well. <I><FONT color=brown>Conclave</FONT></I>, most specifically, refers to the gathering of cardinals to elect a pope. Overtones of this use remain in more general applications, including solemnity, secrecy and high purpose: political candidates elected by party <I><FONT color=brown>conclaves</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Congregation</FONT></I> is even more restricted in use, referring to the adherents of a religion who attend the same local church: the minister’s <I><FONT color=brown>congregation</FONT></I>. In a narrow sense, the word can designate those actually present at a given service, and, in a broad sense, it can embrace all a church’s parishioners. <I><FONT color=brown>Convocation</FONT></I> implies a <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> that has been called by a higher authority: a <I><FONT color=brown>convocation</FONT></I> of clergymen summoned by their bishop.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Congress</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>convention</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>council</FONT></B> often refer to governmental or political bodies. On an international scale, a <I><FONT color=brown>council</FONT></I> may include delegates from many different nations. In ecclesiastical terms, the word may refer specifically to a clerical parliament called to decide matters of church doctrine and discipline: the <I><FONT color=brown>Council</FONT></I> of Trent; the Second Vatican Ecumenical <I><FONT color=brown>Council</FONT></I>. An international <I><FONT color=brown>council</FONT></I>, however, is more often a secular agency or body: the Economic and Social <I><FONT color=brown>Council</FONT></I> of the United Nations; the U.N. Security <I><FONT color=brown>Council</FONT></I>. On a national or local level, <I><FONT color=brown>council</FONT></I> usually indicates wither a non-statutory body with specific aims and membership or an elected administrative or legislative unit: the Road Safety <I><FONT color=brown>Council</FONT></I>, the City <I><FONT color=brown>Council</FONT></I>. In either case, it implies a small, select group, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>congress</FONT></I> and convention suggest larger assemblies or gatherings. A <I><FONT color=brown>council’s</FONT></I> meetings may be closed to the public, like those of a <I><FONT color=brown>conclave</FONT></I> and unlike those of a <I><FONT color=brown>congress</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I>. Purely private organizations may also used the word in their titles: the Australian <I><FONT color=brown>Council</FONT></I> of Wool buyers. In all but the ecclesiastical use, a <I><FONT color=brown>council</FONT></I> consists of its members whether they are gathered in a meeting or not.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Congress</FONT></B> is <B><FONT color=blue>narrower</FONT></B> in application than <I><FONT color=brown>council</FONT></I>, being most commonly used in a governmental sense, particularly of an elected legislative body: the United States <I><FONT color=brown>Congress</FONT></I>. Another meaning survives, however, in the names of some private associations: the <I><FONT color=brown>Congress</FONT></I> for Cultural Freedom. <I><FONT color=brown>Congress</FONT></I> may refer also to a formal <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> of the representatives of sovereign nations, having as its purpose the settlement of certain questions: the <I><FONT color=brown>Congress</FONT></I> of Vienna. <I><FONT color=brown>Convention</FONT></I>, in its political sense, refer to a scheduled <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> of delegates to pass resolutions and elect leaders (or nominate candidates): the quadrennial Democratic and Republican <I><FONT color=brown>conventions</FONT></I> in the United States. <I><FONT color=brown>Convention</FONT></I> is also often used to refer to a state or national such as a professional association, social club or business group. In this kind of <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I>, business is conducted, but many of these gatherings are looked on largely as social occasion: arranging the entertainment at the company’s annual dealer <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I>. While the term <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I> is typically used of national <I><FONT color=brown>meetings</FONT></I>, international <I><FONT color=brown>meetings</FONT></I>, as of scientists, are more often referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>congresses</FONT></I>: an international <I><FONT color=brown>congress</FONT></I> of geophysicists.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Consult">CONSULT</A>, <A href="entry://Gather">GATHER</A>, <A href="entry://Group">GROUP</A>, <A href="entry://Summon">SUMMON</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>melt</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>dissolve</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>liquefy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>thaw</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the process by which a solid is transformed into in fluid. <B><FONT color=blue>Melt</FONT></B> is the most general of these, referring to such a transformation of any solid: ice cubes that had already melted; listing the different temperatures at which various metals <I><FONT color=brown>melt</FONT></I>. Used metaphorically, the word indicates any emotional yielding, usually one in which rigidity or indifference gives way to responsiveness or affectionate concern: a story designed to <I><FONT color=brown>melt</FONT></I> the hardest heart; feeling her resistance to him <I><FONT color=brown>melting</FONT></I> away at their first touch. <B><FONT color=blue>Thaw</FONT></B> is a specific instance of <I><FONT color=brown>melt</FONT></I>, stressing the application of heat as the cause of the <I><FONT color=brown>melting</FONT></I> process, and referring mainly to the transformation of ice or snow into water: signs that the snowdrifts had begun to <I><FONT color=brown>thaw</FONT></I>; wondering when the stream would <I><FONT color=brown>thaw</FONT></I>. But the word has a special use in referring to frozen solids that remain more or less hard even after being subjected to warming: not certain whether the frozen vegetables should be plunged into boiling water or be allowed to <I><FONT color=brown>thaw</FONT></I> out first at room temperature. The word, also, can refer to any warming process: sitting by the fire to <I><FONT color=brown>thaw</FONT></I> out his cold feet. Metaphorically, the word suggests a more gradual yielding to emotional warmth than <I><FONT color=brown>melt</FONT></I>: their ceremonious reserve began to <I><FONT color=brown>thaw</FONT></I> a bit.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dissolve</FONT></B> may function identically with melt: cakes of ice slowly <I><FONT color=brown>dissolving</FONT></I> into puddles. More strictly, the word refers to the specific process by which a solid passes into solution in a solvent: <I><FONT color=brown>dissolving</FONT></I> the tablet in a glass of water; a cleaning agent that <I><FONT color=brown>dissolves</FONT></I> grease stains. By extension, the word is used of any supposed disappearance or eating away of solids: snowbanks that <I><FONT color=brown>dissolve</FONT></I> overnight; erosion that had <I><FONT color=brown>dissolved</FONT></I> acres of topsoil. Metaphorically, the word can suggest a collapse after having yielded to a strong emotion: <I><FONT color=brown>dissolving</FONT></I> into laughter at his discomfiture; <I><FONT color=brown>dissolving</FONT></I> into tears at the news. <B><FONT color=blue>Liquefy</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words and gives a technical or scientific tone. Its usefulness lies in referring generically to any conversion into a liquid state, whether by heat or pressure, and applies both to the conversion of solids and gases: temperatures too low for tungsten to <I><FONT color=brown>liquefy</FONT></I>: using high pressures to <I><FONT color=brown>liquefy</FONT></I> nitrogen. The word is not used to apply metaphorically to emotional states.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Warm">WARM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: crystallize, freeze, harden, jell, solidify.</P>

<P>These words are related in meaning in that they denote in this context qualities or traits that are highly desirable and praiseworthy. <B><FONT color=blue>Merit</FONT></B> refers to attributes that are commendable, though not necessarily superior, and may be predicated to that which has more favourable than unfavourable qualities: His first novel, sketchy and immature as it is, does have <I><FONT color=brown>merit</FONT></I>. When <I><FONT color=brown>merit</FONT></I> is qualified by a negative word, it tends to emphasize a preponderance of unfavourable characteristics rather than the presence of only a few. [As a work of serious scholarship in the field of history, the work has little <I><FONT color=brown>merit</FONT></I>; Her singing is totally without <I><FONT color=brown>merit</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Excellence</FONT></B> denotes qualities that are superior to an unusual degree, and is much stronger and more positive in concept than <I><FONT color=brown>merit</FONT></I>. However, since the word does not indicate perfection, it is sometimes modified by an intensifying adjective. [The particular <I><FONT color=brown>excellence</FONT></I> of her cooking lies in her skilful blending of spices; We were impressed by the technical <I><FONT color=brown>excellence</FONT></I> of his draughtsmanship.]</P><P>According to the meanings limited to these words as a group, <B><FONT color=blue>value</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>worth</FONT></B> have the sense of intrinsic <I><FONT color=brown>excellence</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Value</FONT></I>, however, points to characteristics regarded highly for their usefulness: the <I><FONT color=brown>value</FONT></I> of a sensible diet in maintaining good health; the <I><FONT color=brown>value</FONT></I> to a medical student of thorough undergraduate training in the biological and physical sciences. <I><FONT color=brown>Worth</FONT></I>, on the other hand, applies to things that are esteemed more for their own sake than for their utility: the great <I><FONT color=brown>worth</FONT></I> of a long, close friendship; the <I><FONT color=brown>worth</FONT></I> of being able to take pleasure in small things.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Virtue</FONT></B>, which in this sense has nothing to do with morality, is applied to qualities that give a person or thing its <I><FONT color=brown>value</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>worth</FONT></I>. [The great <I><FONT color=brown>virtue</FONT></I> of air travel is speed; Although this house lacks the <I><FONT color=brown>virtue</FONT></I> of architectural beauty, it is well planned and comfortable to live in.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Perfect">PERFECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: fault, <A href="entry://Flaw">FLAW</A>, unworthiness, weakness, worthlessness.</P>

<P>These words refer to a set or habitual technique for performing a task. <B><FONT color=blue>Method</FONT></B> suggests a fairly elaborate group of techniques and stresses efficiency or accuracy as its goal. <B><FONT color=blue>Way</FONT></B>, by contrast, is much more general, since it can refer either to a single technique or to a complex operation; it is also more informal and carries no suggestions about the technique or operation itself, positive or negative. [The <I><FONT color=brown>way</FONT></I> many students study is appalling; they lack any sense of <I><FONT color=brown>method</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Way</FONT></I> does have a special use that refers to someone’s characteristic approach to a problem: Don’t mind him; it’s just his <I><FONT color=brown>way</FONT></I>. It may even suggest a whole life style: John’s <I><FONT color=brown>way</FONT></I> of doing things; a paranoid’s <I><FONT color=brown>way</FONT></I> of taking criticism; the democratic <I><FONT color=brown>way</FONT></I> of settling arguments.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Procedure</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>system</FONT></B> relates to the elaborate efficiency implied by method rather than to the characteristic style that may be suggested by way. Both stress an even greater elaborateness than method. <I><FONT color=brown>Procedure</FONT></I>, the most formal of all these words, suggests an orderly cut-and-dry set of <I><FONT color=brown>methods</FONT></I> established by a person or organization for coping with routine or bureaucratic details: a <I><FONT color=brown>procedure</FONT></I> for calculating income tax; a <I><FONT color=brown>procedure</FONT></I> for putting a bill through Parliament. <I><FONT color=brown>System</FONT></I> may refer to a whole bundle of <I><FONT color=brown>procedures</FONT></I> established by a person or organization, written or unwritten; it emphasizes the meticulous working out of every detail: the <I><FONT color=brown>system</FONT></I> of selecting national servicemen. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>procedure</FONT></I>, it can be used pejoratively, in which case it refers to a conservative, entrenched establishment: every genius who ever had to fight the <I><FONT color=brown>system</FONT></I>. It can refer neutrally to any functioning entity: the body’s circulatory <I><FONT color=brown>system</FONT></I>. It can also apply to any elaborate scheme, whether functional or not: a <I><FONT color=brown>system</FONT></I> for beating the bookmakers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Manner</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fashion</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mode</FONT></B> refer more to a characteristic style than to an elaborate <I><FONT color=brown>method</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>procedure</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>system</FONT></I>. All three may be used merely as less informal substitutes for way, with mode approaching excessive formality. Each, however, has special nuances all its own. <I><FONT color=brown>Manner</FONT></I> may suggest the good or bad carrying out of a <I><FONT color=brown>method</FONT></I> or the characteristic conduct of someone: results that depend as much on the <I><FONT color=brown>manner</FONT></I> of executing the plans as on the plans themselves; a querulous <I><FONT color=brown>manner</FONT></I> of speaking. <I><FONT color=brown>Fashion</FONT></I> may also stress execution, but is strongly influenced by its other meanings pertaining to those styles of living currently in favour: a new <I><FONT color=brown>fashion</FONT></I> in hairstyles. <I><FONT color=brown>Mode</FONT></I> suggests the choice of one category out of many: public demonstrations as a <I><FONT color=brown>mode</FONT></I> of venting frustration and hostility. It is especially used in culture contexts: a <I><FONT color=brown>mode</FONT></I> of writing in which normal syntax is suppressed to give the effect of chaotic thought processes.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accurate">ACCURATE</A>, <A href="entry://Competent">COMPETENT</A>, <A href="entry://Systematic">SYSTEMATIC</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the movement of people or animals from one place to another. <B><FONT color=blue>Migrate</FONT></B> suggests the movement of a large group: the Teutonic tribes that <I><FONT color=brown>migrated</FONT></I> to Britain; Tasmanian mutton birds that <I><FONT color=brown>migrate</FONT></I> as far north as Alaska in winter. <B><FONT color=blue>Emigrate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>immigrate</FONT></B> refer to permanent movements, mainly of people, whether singly or in small or large groups. Em<I><FONT color=brown>i</FONT></I>grate involves movement from a place; <I><FONT color=brown>immigrate</FONT></I> movement to a place.

The word may emphasize that something is small to the point of having no significance or value; it may also indicate something so small as to require careful scrutiny if it is to be understood: a <I><FONT color=brown>minute</FONT></I> amount of radioactivity that could hurt no one; a <I><FONT color=brown>minute</FONT></I> crack in the wall that led to the amazing discovery. <I><FONT color=brown>Minute</FONT></I> has a related use referring to the intensive scrutiny itself: a <I><FONT color=brown>minute</FONT></I> examination of the murder weapon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Minuscule</FONT></B> is derived from a word referring to an early script that used lower-case letters. While the word can still refer literally to such a script, more generally it indicates something extremely small, and as such is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>minute</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>minuscule</FONT></I> also can refer both to sizes and amounts: a <I><FONT color=brown>minuscule</FONT></I> chess set with peg pieces, designed for travellers; a <I><FONT color=brown>minuscule</FONT></I> slackening of prices after active trading. When the word indicates amount, however, it is more likely than <I><FONT color=brown>minute</FONT></I> to suggest something unimportant or even petty: a <I><FONT color=brown>minute</FONT></I> inspection that turned up only the most <I><FONT color=brown>minuscule</FONT></I> defects in his argument.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Infinitesimal</FONT></B> more commonly applies to amounts that are so small as to be incalculable and insignificant for all practical purposes; more strictly, it reflects its relation to the word infinite by referring to something that is infinitely small. The word is often used not so much literally as in exaggeration: making much of an <I><FONT color=brown>infinitesimal</FONT></I> error.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Microscopic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>miniature</FONT></B>, by contrast, refer most often to size. <I><FONT color=brown>Microscopic</FONT></I> literally refers to something too small to be seen without the aid of a microscope: the abundance of <I><FONT color=brown>microscopic</FONT></I> organisms that flourish in the sea. <I><FONT color=brown>Miniature</FONT></I>, on the other hand, refers to something that is small but by no means invisible or even difficult to see with the naked eye. It suggests most strongly the scaling down of something to small size, as a model. The word relates, by derivation, to small-sized paintings and can still apply in this way. For other things, the word may carry a note of amazement or wonder at the effective job of reducing the proportions of something; it can also suggest an effect of quaintness: a <I><FONT color=brown>miniature</FONT></I> doll’s-house; a <I><FONT color=brown>miniature</FONT></I> castle where children could fight imaginary battles.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compact">COMPACT</A>, <A href="entry://Small">SMALL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Large">LARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Massive">MASSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Tremendous">TREMENDOUS</A>.</P>

<P>These words describe the character or behaviour of a person who defies convention or authority, and are often used in reference to children. <B><FONT color=blue>Mischievous</FONT></B> is to be found in connection with the playful, teasing, but nonetheless irritating behaviour that is part of every child’s make-up at one time or another. It suggests that the harm done or trouble caused is neither lasting nor severe: The <I><FONT color=brown>mischievous</FONT></I> boy went through the house hanging all the pictures upside-down. When used to characterize an adult, however, <I><FONT color=brown>mischievous</FONT></I> suggests a manner or action that is more troublesome than playful, more harmful than teasing: a <I><FONT color=brown>mischievous</FONT></I> gossip who broke up his marriage by spreading rumours about his wife.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Naughty</FONT></B> is commonly used by adults when speaking of a child’s misbehaviour, and, sometimes, humorously, when speaking of the sexual attraction or peccadilloes of another adult. [You were a <I><FONT color=brown>naughty</FONT></I> boy, Johnny, breaking your sister’s doll that way; an actress who built her reputation on being "<I><FONT color=brown>naughty</FONT></I> but nice."] Although the application of naughty to children is usually confined to instances of trivial breaches of conduct, it is sometimes used to refer to more reprehensible action and in such cases can be considered a euphemism for certain senses of <B><FONT color=blue>bad</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Bad</FONT></I> is a very broad word. It can at times he interchangeable with the most innocent connotations of <I><FONT color=brown>mischievous</FONT></I>. [What a <I><FONT color=brown>bad</FONT></I> little girl you are, smearing jam all over mummy’s new dress.] But it may also describe a child (and, of course, an adolescent or adult) who is wilful, intractable, immoral or evil.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Delinquent</FONT></B> as an adjective means neglectful of duty or obligation: a <I><FONT color=brown>delinquent</FONT></I> father who spent more time playing poker than playing with his children. This meaning is not very often found in reference to children or young people, possibly because of the very common use of the word in the expression <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile delinquent</FONT></I>, which means a young person guilty of anti-social or criminal behavour. It is unfortunate that this expression, which is specific in tone and pejorative in connotation, is applied loosely to young people who are indeed not <I><FONT color=brown>juvenile delinquents</FONT></I> but merely <I><FONT color=brown>mischievous</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>bad</FONT></I> or <B><FONT color=blue>disobedient</FONT></B>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disobedient</FONT></B> is another broad word. It refers simply to a failure or a refusal to obey, but its connotations when it is used to describe a child are different from those applying to an adult. Very young children who are characterized as <I><FONT color=brown>disobedient</FONT></I> might instead be called <I><FONT color=brown>mischievous</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>naughty</FONT></I>; they are rarely guilty of any serious misbehaviour, and their failure or refusal to obey is more an act of will than of reason. Older children, adolescents and adults, however, who are <I><FONT color=brown>disobedient</FONT></I> may be guilty of a major oversight or transgression: a <I><FONT color=brown>disobedient</FONT></I> student who was forced to leave boarding school; a habitually <I><FONT color=brown>disobedient</FONT></I> soldier who was finally court-martialled after he struck his commanding officer.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Behaviour">BEHAVIOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Bother">BOTHER</A>, <A href="entry://Unruly">UNRULY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Obedient">OBEDIENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words may be applied to the personal experience of physical and mental pain or depression or to the things which cause the pain or depression. They are also used describe things that are below average in character, condition or performance. When a physical, mental or environmental state causes great suffering or unhappiness, it can be referred to as <B><FONT color=blue>miserable</FONT></B>. [I’ve been struggling along all day with a miserable headache; It is sometimes difficult to acknowledge that another person’s lot may be more <I><FONT color=brown>miserable</FONT></I> than one’s own.] The word also suggests something that is worthless or of inferior quality: to waste an evening at a <I><FONT color=brown>miserable</FONT></I> play. <B><FONT color=blue>Dismal</FONT></B> describes something that lacks cheer or joy, and also characterizes the gloomy, depressed feelings that such a thing can provoke: a <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I> day, with threatening clouds hanging in the sky; feeling <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I> after reading a newspaper report of the latest bushfires. In referring to something that is below average, <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I> hints at calamity or disaster: a new business enterprise that turned out to be a <I><FONT color=brown>dismal</FONT></I> failure.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sorry</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unhappy</FONT></B> describe unpleasant mental states. <I><FONT color=brown>Sorry</FONT></I> connotes the kind of sadness, major or minor, that is produced by loss, injury, misfortune or the like. It may be aroused by one’s own troubles or those of a friend, and it is often combined with a feeling of regret. [I’m <I><FONT color=brown>sorry</FONT></I> to see my long-service leave end ?it’s been a pleasant holiday.] <I><FONT color=brown>Unhappy</FONT></I> can be a weaker word than sorry if it merely indicates the absence of happiness: <I><FONT color=brown>unhappy</FONT></I> about having to go to a dull party. But it can characterize a more lasting state of discontent: a profoundly <I><FONT color=brown>unhappy</FONT></I> man with no friends and no interests other than his work. When used critically, <I><FONT color=brown>sorry</FONT></I> often gives an indication of pity, ridicule or concern. [What a <I><FONT color=brown>sorry</FONT></I> spectacle he made of himself when he got drunk; The world is certainly in a <I><FONT color=brown>sorry</FONT></I> state.] <I><FONT color=brown>Unhappy</FONT></I> is less general and not as strong as <I><FONT color=brown>sorry</FONT></I> when it is used in criticism to mean unfortunate, unlucky, not tactful or inappropriate: an <I><FONT color=brown>unhappy</FONT></I> choice of words.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Wretched</FONT></B> is stronger in tone than either sorry or unhappy in its indication of a severely distressed mental state, but is interchangeable with <I><FONT color=brown>miserable</FONT></I> in reference to personal misfortune or physical discomfort: a <I><FONT color=brown>wretched</FONT></I> cripple who was forced to beg in the streets; He was feeling <I><FONT color=brown>wretched</FONT></I> as a result of a recurrent back problem. When used to describe quality, ability or performance, the word is strong again in meaning unsatisfactory or worthless: The performance was spoilt because the soprano was in such <I><FONT color=brown>wretched</FONT></I> voice.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Pathetic">PATHETIC</A>, <A href="entry://Sad">SAD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheerful">CHEERFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Contented">CONTENTED</A>, <A href="entry://Joyous">JOYOUS</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote suffering of body or mind. The suffering may be the result of some injurious external interference, as a wound, bruise, harsh word, etc. it may arise from an abnormality in bodily or mental functions, as disease, envy or discontent. It may be occasioned by the lack of something one needs, as food or love.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Misery</FONT></B> refers to a chronic or prolonged suffering, whether physical, mental or emotional. There is a suggestion of hopelessness about this word: the <I><FONT color=brown>misery</FONT></I> of the arthritic. <B><FONT color=blue>Distress</FONT></B> is too strong a word for little hurts, too feeble for the most intense suffering. It is applied more often than not to mental state, referring to any deep anxiety or the external circumstances that may produce it. Very commonly it applies to some prolonged trouble, as does <I><FONT color=brown>misery</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>distress</FONT></I> more than <I><FONT color=brown>misery</FONT></I> implies at least a possibility of relief: the <I><FONT color=brown>distress</FONT></I> of an underprivileged child. <B><FONT color=blue>Discomfort</FONT></B> is the mildest of the words in this group, denoting little more than the absence of well-being and ease: the <I><FONT color=brown>discomfort</FONT></I> of a hot, humid day.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agony</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>anguish</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>torment</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>torture</FONT></B> all refer to intense suffering of body or mind. <I><FONT color=brown>Agony</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>torture</FONT></I> are perhaps most closely associated with physical pain. <I><FONT color=brown>Agony</FONT></I> represents suffering, the endurance of which calls forth every human resource. Its severity is of such extent that the word is often used to denote the struggle and pain that may precede death: In his final <I><FONT color=brown>agony</FONT></I> he called for the religious comfort which he had rejected for years. <I><FONT color=brown>Torture</FONT></I> puts great stress upon the agent which causes or inflicts it: Nazi madmen who indulged in the <I><FONT color=brown>torture</FONT></I> of their victims before they killed them; the recurrent <I><FONT color=brown>torture</FONT></I> of migraine. <I><FONT color=brown>Torment</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>anguish</FONT></I> suggest mental suffering. <I><FONT color=brown>Torment</FONT></I> hints at repeated or continuous instances of attack: the <I><FONT color=brown>torment</FONT></I> of an alcoholic husband. <I><FONT color=brown>Anguish</FONT></I> points to the extremity of grief which so terrifies the spirit as to be insupportable: the <I><FONT color=brown>anguish</FONT></I> she knew when her husband and three children were burnt to death; <I><FONT color=brown>anguish</FONT></I> so great that it turned into madness.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Passion</FONT></B>, in the sense being compared here, is now limited to the New Testament account of the <I><FONT color=brown>anguish</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>agony</FONT></I> of Jesus Christ which culminated in his crucifixion.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Harm">HARM</A>, <A href="entry://Hurt">HURT</A>, <A href="entry://Pain">PAIN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Happiness">HAPPINESS</A>, <A href="entry://Pleasure">PLEASURE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>mislay</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lose</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>misplace</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>miss</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to accidental losses. <B><FONT color=blue>Mislay</FONT></B> suggests the absent-minded or disorganized act of putting something down where it doesn’t belong, without remembering later exactly where it is: afraid that he had <I><FONT color=brown>mislaid</FONT></I> the car keys; searching frantically for the <I><FONT color=brown>mislaid</FONT></I> title to the house. The word suggests that the <I><FONT color=brown>mislaid</FONT></I> item is of relatively small size and somewhat difficult to keep track of. <B><FONT color=blue>Misplace</FONT></B>, on the other hand, would not be so restricted: <I><FONT color=brown>misplaced</FONT></I> a whole truckload of wheat in one of the marshalling yards. The word can merely suggest bad planning rather than temporary loss: finding that the table had been <I><FONT color=brown>misplaced</FONT></I>, and was too near the open fire. The word can suggest an action that may be intentional or unwise: deliberately <I><FONT color=brown>misplacing</FONT></I> the book on a shelf where no one could find it; <I><FONT color=brown>misplaced</FONT></I> admiration for another woman’s husband.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lose</FONT></B> is the most general of the words, suggesting any accidental failure to keep hold of something one possesses: <I><FONT color=brown>losing</FONT></I> the change through a hole in his pocket. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>mislay</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>misplace</FONT></I> suggest that the desired item may eventually be found, <I><FONT color=brown>lose</FONT></I> may suggest a permanent lack: he hadn’t <I><FONT color=brown>lost</FONT></I> the letter; he had simply <I><FONT color=brown>misplaced</FONT></I> it. <I><FONT color=brown>Lost</FONT></I> in its generality has a much wider range of use than these other words: <I><FONT color=brown>losing</FONT></I> his way; <I><FONT color=brown>losing</FONT></I> the account to his competitor; trying to <I><FONT color=brown>lose</FONT></I> the man in the crowd.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Miss</FONT></B> is much more specific in this context.

<P>These words refer to the giving or receiving of mistaken impressions. Although <B><FONT color=blue>misleading</FONT></B> is restricted to something that is apt to give a false impression, it is still the most general of these words in that it can apply to great or small potential misapprehensions, whether fostered intentionally, unintentionally or without any intent whatever: a <I><FONT color=brown>misleading</FONT></I> advertisement that deliberately left out the medicinal preparation’s possible side effects; peace offers that were <I><FONT color=brown>misleading</FONT></I> because of inexpert translations; clouds with a <I><FONT color=brown>misleading</FONT></I> look of calm to them.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deceiving</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>deceptive</FONT></B> would both seem stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>misleading</FONT></I> because an actual lie is implied rather than merely a misapprehension. Nevertheless, like <I><FONT color=brown>misleading</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>deceptive</FONT></I> also restricts itself to the possibility, somewhat greater in this case, of a mistaken impression, whether intentional or not. <I><FONT color=brown>Deceiving</FONT></I>, however, does suggest both a deliberate and successful lie: vertical stripes that give a <I><FONT color=brown>deceptive</FONT></I> impression of greater height; householders who are assured by the TV repairman’s <I><FONT color=brown>deceiving</FONT></I> air of knowing what he is doing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dissembling</FONT></B> refers to a deliberate pretence whether believe or not, and <B><FONT color=blue>deceitful</FONT></B>, the strongest of all these words, refers to a constantly <I><FONT color=brown>dissembling</FONT></I> manner and an ingrained habit of telling lies. <B><FONT color=blue>Delusive</FONT></B> functions like <I><FONT color=brown>deceptive</FONT></I> except that it suggests mistaken impressions so great as to constitute a complete derangement of mind or a flagrant departure from fact. Because delusion can be the result of mental imbalance, <I><FONT color=brown>delusive</FONT></I> often seems to suggest a self-imposed belief that corresponds to one’s own wishes or needs.

<P>These words denote something done, said or believed incorrectly or improperly. <B><FONT color=blue>Mistake</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>error</FONT></B> are the most common and general words of this group. In many contexts they are interchangeable, but <I><FONT color=brown>error</FONT></I> often implies deviation from a standard or model, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>mistake</FONT></I> is preferred in the common situations of everyday life. [It was a <I><FONT color=brown>mistake</FONT></I> to suppose that George could ever get here on time; an <I><FONT color=brown>error</FONT></I> in logic or in arithmetic; a typographical error.] <I><FONT color=brown>Error</FONT></I> is used also in a theological sense to mean sin, since sin is perceived as deviation from the moral standards or theological truth established by religion.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>blunder</FONT></B> is a blatant <I><FONT color=brown>error</FONT></I>, usually one involving behaviour or judgement, and implying an ignorant or uninformed assessment of a situation. [Offering to negotiate with the enemy at that time was an inexcusable <I><FONT color=brown>blunder</FONT></I>.] <B><FONT color=blue>Slip</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>faux pas</FONT></B> (literally "<I><FONT color=brown>false step</FONT></I>") are minor <I><FONT color=brown>mistakes</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Slip</FONT></I> emphasizes the accidental rather than ignorant character of a <I><FONT color=brown>mistake</FONT></I> and is often used to mean the careless divulging of secret or private information: a <I><FONT color=brown>slip</FONT></I> of the tongue. A <I><FONT color=brown>faux pas</FONT></I> is an embarrassing beach of etiquette. [He forgot that she had remarried, and introduced her with her first husband’s name ?a <I><FONT color=brown>faux pas</FONT></I> that made everybody momentarily uncomfortable.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Boner</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>boo-boo</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>goof</FONT></B> are all slang terms, and all have a somewhat humorous tone.

Similarly, a <I><FONT color=brown>goof</FONT></I> is an indefensible but honestly admitted error which contains in its admission a covert plea that the <I><FONT color=brown>goof</FONT></I> be regarded with indulgent forgiveness.

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Mixture</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>combination</FONT></B> are the broadest of these terms, all of which suggest the bringing together of diverse elements into a new whole. While <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> may apply to any materials joined in any way, it is perhaps most appropriate for the adding together of amorphous quantities in which there is no surrendering of individual particles to a new identity: a <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> of sand and gravel; a <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> of fine tobacco; a <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> of peanuts and cashews. Metaphorically, it may suggest fortuitous collocations, as in a <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> of luck and perseverance; or it may imply a mingling of opposites, as in a <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> of good and bad. <I><FONT color=brown>Combination</FONT></I> suggests a closer union of mingled elements, though not necessarily their fusion: a <I><FONT color=brown>combination</FONT></I> of tested ingredients. Metaphorically, it can imply a conscious selection of elements for effect: a striking colour <I><FONT color=brown>combination</FONT></I> of blues and greys. It can also imply an eclectic distillation: a <I><FONT color=brown>combination</FONT></I> of several prevailing dramatic styles; new <I><FONT color=brown>combinations</FONT></I> of proven therapeutic techniques. It is more "high-toned" than <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> and is often used to confer status on the user.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Composite</FONT></B> is more formal still than <I><FONT color=brown>combination</FONT></I>, but tends to imply that the materials have been patched or pieced together from disparate sources; in motion pictures, for example, a <I><FONT color=brown>composite</FONT></I> is a shot that consists of several superimposed images. The word can suggest a more complete fusion of elements: David Low’s Colonel Blimp was a <I><FONT color=brown>composite</FONT></I> of all those Was Office "brass hats" who pompously clung to antiquated ideas.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Blend</FONT></B> suggests more fusion still and, generally, a loss of individual identity for the elements in a <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>blend</FONT></I> of whiskies. The word suggests that skill, control and conscious intention governed the making of the new whole. While many kinds of material can be used in a <I><FONT color=brown>blend</FONT></I>, the word suggests most specifically a <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> of fluids or gases.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Alloy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>amalgam</FONT></B> in their most specific senses refer to new metals made by fusing two or more metals in order to obtain valuable properties of each in the new <I><FONT color=brown>combination</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Alloy</FONT></I> is the generic term for any such blend, while amalgam is a specific term referring to an <I><FONT color=brown>alloy</FONT></I> of another metal with mercury. Metaphorically, <I><FONT color=brown>amalgam</FONT></I> is loosely used to mean <I><FONT color=brown>combination</FONT></I>, and here it most often suggests a confused <I><FONT color=brown>combination</FONT></I>: The child’s account of what happened was an <I><FONT color=brown>amalgam</FONT></I> of fact and fancy. Metaphorically, <I><FONT color=brown>alloy</FONT></I> is often used to suggest the <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> of a fine quality with a baser one that reduces its purity: an <I><FONT color=brown>alloy</FONT></I> of love and possessiveness.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Compound</FONT></B>, in its scientific sense, indicates the closest unity of any of these words; it refers to a chemical formed from two or more elements. Water, for example, is a <I><FONT color=brown>compound</FONT></I> of hydrogen and oxygen. In metaphorical uses, <I><FONT color=brown>compound</FONT></I> is less exact, meaning any <I><FONT color=brown>mixture</FONT></I> of things in fairly close relation to each other: a <I><FONT color=brown>compound</FONT></I> of wit and intelligence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Component">COMPONENT</A>, <A href="entry://Connect">CONNECT</A>, <A href="entry://Diversify">DIVERSIFY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to what is new or to what exists now. <B><FONT color=blue>Modern</FONT></B> suggests a historical division of time including the present and what has gone immediately before it; this can be a comparatively long or short period. [The discovery of America in 1492 demarcates medieval from <I><FONT color=brown>modern</FONT></I> history; Several <I><FONT color=brown>modern</FONT></I> schools of painting were unheard of in the 1920s.] <I><FONT color=brown>Modern</FONT></I> may also distinguish something in vogue from something old-fashioned, or a present period from an older one: <I><FONT color=brown>modern</FONT></I> furniture that looked strange against the room’s Edwardian architecture. Like <I><FONT color=brown>modern</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>contemporary</FONT></B> may be used to refer to a historical division that includes the present, but it usually suggests a much narrower slice of time than <I><FONT color=brown>modern</FONT></I>: the trends in <I><FONT color=brown>modern</FONT></I> times that have culminated in certain <I><FONT color=brown>contemporary</FONT></I> attitudes. On the other hand, <I><FONT color=brown>contemporary</FONT></I> but is most often used simply as classification rather than in implying a positive or negative judgement about value: arguing that present-day taste was evenly split between <I><FONT color=brown>modern</FONT></I> and traditional styles.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Recent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>current</FONT></B> stress what exists now; <I><FONT color=brown>recent</FONT></I> emphasizes factual classification of the immediately preceding past, a slice of time narrower than <I><FONT color=brown>contemporary</FONT></I> but more extended than present-day. <I><FONT color=brown>Current</FONT></I>, by contrast, emphasizes only those <I><FONT color=brown>recent</FONT></I> things that are still viable at this moment.

<B><FONT color=blue>mole</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>birthmark</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>freckle</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>naevus</FONT></B>:

<P>These words denote pigmented or reddish marks or nodules on the skin that may be permanent and either are present at birth or develop later on in life. <B><FONT color=blue>Mole</FONT></B> refers to a type of permanent spot which may vary in colour from yellowish brown to dark brown. <I><FONT color=brown>Moles</FONT></I> are usually congenital in origin and may be large or small, flat or protuberant, some having sprouting hairs. Occasionally they become malignant. They are often removed, either for cosmetic reasons or as a precautionary measure, if they grow larger or undergo any change in appearance. At various times in history a <I><FONT color=brown>mole</FONT></I> on the face of a woman, especially on the cheekbone, has been highly prized and referred to as "a beauty mark" or "beauty spot" because it serves to set off the whiteness of the skin.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>birthmark</FONT></B> is often a <I><FONT color=brown>mole</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>birthmark</FONT></I> may also take other forms, most commonly that of elevated pink or bright red growths (called in medicine haemangiomas), sometimes covering large areas of the skin. Popularly called "strawberry marks" or "port wine stains," such <I><FONT color=brown>birthmarks</FONT></I> are composed of clusters of small, surface blood vessels and capillaries. <B><FONT color=blue>Naevus</FONT></B> is the technical term for both <I><FONT color=brown>mole</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>birthmark</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Freckle</FONT></B> applies to one of a large colony of small, flat, brown or tan spots on the skin, which are not congenital. They tend to appear on the fair, rosy complexion of people with sandy or red hair and multiply when the skin is exposed to the sun, and often fade or disappear entirely during the cooler seasons. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>moles</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>birthmarks</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>freckles</FONT></I> are rarely considered blemishes, as they are very common and often considered attractive.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Neoplasm">NEOPLASM</A>, <A href="entry://Wart">WART</A>.</P>

mongrel
<B><FONT color=blue>mongrel</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cur</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hound</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mutt</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are comparable in that they are all used to designate a kind of dog and, in a pejorative way, a kind of person. A <B><FONT color=blue>mongrel</FONT></B> is any animal or plant of mixed breed, but especially a dog. Since there is a strong suggestion of illegitimacy about a <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I> (often shortened to <I><FONT color=brown>mong</FONT></I>), such a dog is often looked down upon by dog fanciers. It may, indeed, be this somewhat contemptuous feeling for mongrel dogs which has given the pejorative connotation to <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I> when it denotes a person who is not of a pure race, whose parents are of different national or social back grounds, or one whose tendencies, political opinions, religious convictions, etc., are undefined or uncertain. [Ever since that "independent" member was elected, the only consistency about him has been his inconsistency; the man has proved himself to be a political <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I>.] In reference to a man, <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I> also means one who is despicable on account of cruelly inconsiderate behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Cur</FONT></B>, in its denotation of a dog, is synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I>. But whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I>, in spite of its questionable ancestry, can be looked on as a worthwhile pet, a <I><FONT color=brown>cur</FONT></I> is despised by the dog lover as an inferior, ugly or unfriendly beast. The same feeling reserved for this cur greets the mean, malicious, cowardly or otherwise objectionable person who is described by the same name: a man with pretensions to honour and bravery who proves himself a cur in the face of the slightest danger. The mainly American word <B><FONT color=blue>mutt</FONT></B>, when it designates a dog, is synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>cur</FONT></I>, but, even more than is true with <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I>, mutt frequently refers to a loved pet rather than to one that is thought to be worthless. A person who is a <I><FONT color=brown>mutt</FONT></I> is stupid or doltish. Although such a person is not held in high esteem, he is usually not treated with the contempt or disdain accorded one called <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>cur</FONT></I>. One might, in fact, feel the same kind of affection for the human <I><FONT color=brown>mutt</FONT></I> that is shown for the less than pedigreed dog.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hound</FONT></B>, like the other words in this group, is general in its designation of a dog of any breed or background. It can be specific in a way the other words cannot, when it refers to any of several breeds of hunting dog. When <I><FONT color=brown>hound</FONT></I> denotes a person it may characterize someone who is detestable in the way that a <I><FONT color=brown>mongrel</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>cur</FONT></I> is. But it may also refer, in an informal way, to a person who is fond to the point of addiction of a certain pastime, activity, food, etc.: a bridge <I><FONT color=brown>hound</FONT></I>; a hot-pie <I><FONT color=brown>hound</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Animal">ANIMAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words are all used to describe someone or something that induces a state of dissatisfaction or weariness. <B><FONT color=blue>Monotonous</FONT></B> originally meant unvaried in inflection, cadence, pitch or tone: It was incredible that a lieder singer of her reputation should have such a <I><FONT color=brown>monotonous</FONT></I> voice. This meaning was later extended to refer to anything that is so lacking in variety as to cause fatigue or annoyance: The views from may train window grew <I><FONT color=brown>monotonous</FONT></I> after an hour or two and I found myself dozing off. <B><FONT color=blue>Dull</FONT></B> has many meanings, but in the sense being compared here, it is used to characterize a person or thing that is uninteresting because of a lack of variety, spirit, attraction, delight, etc.: a <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I> performer; a <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I> book; a <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I> meal. That which is <B><FONT color=blue>boring</FONT></B> may be <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>monotonous</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>boring</FONT></I> film unrelieved by dramatic conflict, wit or even a decent bit of acting. <I><FONT color=brown>Boring</FONT></I>, more than the other words in this group, can refer to that discontent and indifference known as ennui. This feeling may be a reaction to some person or thing, but it may also be the result of spiritual torpor and a general dissatisfaction with life. <B><FONT color=blue>Tedious</FONT></B> is like the preceding words in meaning but it goes beyond them in its suggestion that <I><FONT color=brown>monotony</FONT></I> or inactivity causes a repression of energy and an attendant physical discomfort: The month I spent confined to a hospital bed was so <I><FONT color=brown>tedious</FONT></I> that I couldn’t wait to get back to work. <I><FONT color=brown>Tedious</FONT></I> also refers to the kind of boredom one feels as a result of wordiness in speech or writing: The lecture was so <I><FONT color=brown>tedious</FONT></I> that people began to leave before it was half over. <B><FONT color=blue>Tiresome</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>tedious</FONT></I>, implies fatigue: a <I><FONT color=brown>tiresome</FONT></I> day filled with exhausting household tasks. The word also has connotations of annoyance that are stronger than those in the four other terms: a very beautiful woman, but <I><FONT color=brown>tiresome</FONT></I> because of her bad temper.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Listless">LISTLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Numb">NUMB</A>, <A href="entry://Sloth">SLOTH</A>, <A href="entry://Stupid">STUPID</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: diversified, exciting, interesting, stimulating, varied.</P>

<P>All these words refer to acts that are in a accord with a code of right and wrong. <B><FONT color=blue>Moral</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ethical</FONT></B>, once distinguishable from each other, have recently taken on fine distinctions in meaning. <I><FONT color=brown>Moral</FONT></I> is now more often used in a quasi-religious sense, <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I> in a quasi-legal sense: the <I><FONT color=brown>moral</FONT></I> rectitude of a saint; a code of <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I> practices for solicitors. <I><FONT color=brown>Moral</FONT></I> might be thought to include this narrower sense of <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I>, making the one term generic, the other specific, but <I><FONT color=brown>moral</FONT></I> has more and more come to mean personal conduct as set by an external code or standard, especially when such conduct does not affect numbers of people: a <I><FONT color=brown>moral</FONT></I> standard that specified moderation in food and drink and an avoidance of worldly pleasures. <I><FONT color=brown>Ethical</FONT></I>, by contrast, is more and more taken to describe just and fair dealings with other people, not by the application of an external standard but by a pragmatic consideration of all aspects of a situation in light of past experience. To put it most extremely, moral can often be taken to mean private, codified and rigid; <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I> to mean public, improvisatory and flexible: agreeing, despite differing <I><FONT color=brown>moral</FONT></I> values, on <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I> ways to work with each other. The split between the two words, however, is by no means as sharp as this attempt to contrast them might suggest; they do overlap; the can still be used interchangeably.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Upright</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>decent</FONT></B> are more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>moral</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I>, but they shade away from each other in much the same way as the first pair. <I><FONT color=brown>Upright</FONT></I> may suggest an inner moral strength, <I><FONT color=brown>decent</FONT></I> an outgoing <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I> concern for others. While <I><FONT color=brown>decent</FONT></I>, in fact, has no pejorative uses, <I><FONT color=brown>upright</FONT></I> can sometimes suggest excessive rigidity: stiff-necked, <I><FONT color=brown>upright</FONT></I> Puritans.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Virtuous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>honourable</FONT></B> are slightly more formal than moral and <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I>, but the same contrast in shadings can be felt. Here, <I><FONT color=brown>virtuous</FONT></I> suggests a private life free of blemish, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>honourable</FONT></I> suggests decent and <I><FONT color=brown>ethical</FONT></I> dealings with others: a <I><FONT color=brown>virtuous</FONT></I> young girl; those businessmen who are both competitive and <I><FONT color=brown>honourable</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Righteous</FONT></B>, of course, strongly suggests someone who lives almost faultlessly in accordance with strict <I><FONT color=brown>moral</FONT></I> standards. The word now is somewhat less used than previously except in such expressions as <I><FONT color=brown>righteous</FONT></I> indignation, which is indignation aroused by injustice or a lack of fair play. Otherwise, <I><FONT color=brown>righteous</FONT></I> tends to suggest priggishness, narrow-mindedness and intolerance: a happy-go-lucky man who had the misfortune of being married to a <I><FONT color=brown>righteous</FONT></I> woman. The more common <B><FONT color=blue>self-righteous</FONT></B> is always pejorative and stresses pharisaism and an exaggerated sense of one’s own moral superiority over that of others. <B><FONT color=blue>Good</FONT></B> is a vague, general synonym for any of these words and cannot be restricted to specific shades of meaning.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chaste">CHASTE</A>, <A href="entry://Goodness">GOODNESS</A>, <A href="entry://Sincere">HONEST</A>, <A href="entry://Trust">TRUST</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dishonourable, <A href="entry://Unethical">UNETHICAL</A>.</P>

<P>All these words can be used as invective against someone thought to be stupid or foolish. <B><FONT color=blue>Moron</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>imbecile</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>idiot</FONT></B> formerly functioned neutrally as classifications for degrees of mental deficiency, <I><FONT color=brown>moron</FONT></I> denoting a mild deficiency, <I><FONT color=brown>imbecile</FONT></I> a moderate level of deficiency, and <I><FONT color=brown>idiot</FONT></I> a degree of severe deficiency. Nowadays the phrase "mentally retarded child" (or person) preceded by a qualifying word such as mildly or severely is the preferred term, both in popular and technical writing, for any of these levels. As invective, little distinction exists between the three terms.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dullard</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>simpleton</FONT></B> both lack the precise denotations of the previous group, but they do refer to a slow-witted rather than a foolish person. <I><FONT color=brown>Dullard</FONT></I> is the more formal of the two and suggests a mild degree of mental deficiency that renders one passive, unresponsive or imperceptive: appalled to find that her class seemed to be filled with <I><FONT color=brown>dullards</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Simpleton</FONT></I> suggests greater deficiency; it has a faintly archaic flavour that sometimes brings to mind a touching innocence or sweetness of disposition: the class <I><FONT color=brown>simpleton</FONT></I> whom we all loved for his good nature despite his inability to learn.</P><P>The remaining words are all extremely informal. <B><FONT color=blue>Clot</FONT></B> suggests someone prone to making foolish mistakes: such a <I><FONT color=brown>clot</FONT></I> that he gave his intending visitors the wrong address. As in the case of many colloquial terms, other words exist with varying currency but the same generality of meaning.

In figurative uses it suggests a great expanse of labour to work out a solution against considerable resistance: negotiators who <I><FONT color=brown>forged</FONT></I> the final draft of the agreement. <B><FONT color=blue>Fashion</FONT></B> suggests none of the extremes of effort implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>forge</FONT></I>; it is very close to the literal denotation of <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I>, and is used figuratively in much the way that <I><FONT color=brown>mould</FONT></I> is, referring to the influence of instruction or conditioning on a person: <I><FONT color=brown>fashioning</FONT></I> a talented amateur into a brilliant actor. The word may sometimes suggest an improvised solution: <I><FONT color=brown>fashioning</FONT></I> from her hairpin a crude device with which to open the lock.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Model</FONT></B> relates to <I><FONT color=brown>mould</FONT></I> in the specific sense of working a malleable raw material: children who <I><FONT color=brown>modelled</FONT></I> clay for an hour each morning. The word is more frequently used, however, in the sense of displaying an example of someone’s work, especially in relation to designers of women’s clothes. Another still-viable use of this word refers to construction that is carried out along the lines of an earlier example: new countries that <I><FONT color=brown>model</FONT></I> their systems of government on Britain’s; <I><FONT color=brown>modelling</FONT></I> his spy story on all the clichéd situations used in earlier beat-sellers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sculpt</FONT></B>, a back-formation from sculptor, is the most technical of all these words, and involves senses of <I><FONT color=brown>form</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>shape</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>mould</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>model</FONT></I> when applied to the art of creating a design or figure out of solid material such as stone, plaster, etc.: He was commissioned to <I><FONT color=brown>sculpt</FONT></I> a reclining figure for each side of the entrance.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Make">MANUFACTURE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to projections of earth or stone that are elevated above the surrounding landscape. <B><FONT color=blue>Mountain</FONT></B> refers to a high-rising rocky projection that is typically steep and has a narrow summit. When <I><FONT color=brown>mountains</FONT></I> occur grouped together they are collectively called a <B><FONT color=blue>range</FONT></B>: The Blue <I><FONT color=brown>Mountains</FONT></I> near Sydney are an eastward spur of the Great Dividing <I><FONT color=brown>Range</FONT></I>. A plateau is a <I><FONT color=brown>mountain</FONT></I> that has a wide flat top, as though the peak had been sliced off or the <I><FONT color=brown>mountain</FONT></I> truncated at some midway point. <B><FONT color=blue>Plateau</FONT></B> may also refer to a <B><FONT color=blue>tableland</FONT></B> ?an extensive area of highly sides like a <I><FONT color=brown>mountain</FONT></I> but may merge more gradually with the surrounding lowlands. The Atherton <I><FONT color=brown>Tableland</FONT></I> in north Queensland is a fertile <I><FONT color=brown>plateau</FONT></I> of the Great Dividing <I><FONT color=brown>Range</FONT></I>, with an area of some 12,000 square miles and an average height of 2,500 feet.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hill</FONT></B> indicates a projection of earth that is more low-lying than a mountain; such a shape may be of considerable size: the Cheviot <I><FONT color=brown>Hills</FONT></I> between England and Scotland. Or it may point to a very slight rise of ground: the <I><FONT color=brown>hill</FONT></I> at one end of the garden. <B><FONT color=blue>Hillock</FONT></B> specifically points to such a small <I><FONT color=brown>hill</FONT></I>, typically suggesting a brief grassy rise of indefinite or ragged shape: leaving undisturbed occasional bushy <I><FONT color=brown>hillock</FONT></I> on either side of the highway.</P><P>The remaining words suggest abrupt or jutting outcroppings of rocky forms that may or may not be topographically part of a <I><FONT color=brown>mountain</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Cliff</FONT></B> indicates a high vertical shape that drops away suddenly to a lower level; it is particularly used to refer to the edges or side of a mountain or plateau: a winding road cut into the <I><FONT color=brown>cliff</FONT></I>. The word may indicate a sharp break between two level stretches: sauntering out to stand on the <I><FONT color=brown>cliff</FONT></I> overlooking the ocean.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Precipice</FONT></B> is less general in referring almost solely to a sharply jutting vertical rise or overhang of rock or stone: the <I><FONT color=brown>precipice</FONT></I> made by the steep side of the <I><FONT color=brown>mountain</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Promontory</FONT></B> specifically indicates a high point of land such as a <I><FONT color=brown>hill</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>cliff</FONT></I> that extends into the sea: the lighthouse set on a <I><FONT color=brown>promontory</FONT></I> that dominated the surrounding landscape.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Mountain</FONT></I> has a wide range of metaphorical uses referring to great amounts, weights or sizes: a <I><FONT color=brown>mountain</FONT></I> of work; this <I><FONT color=brown>mountain</FONT></I> of a man. In a special figurative sense, hill is often used to imply deterioration of faculties because of age: The professor is over the <I><FONT color=brown>hill</FONT></I> ?he should have retired years ago. Used metaphorically, <I><FONT color=brown>precipice</FONT></I> usually suggests danger, as from falling: moving closer to the <I><FONT color=brown>precipice</FONT></I> of nuclear war.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Summit">SUMMIT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Plain">PLAIN</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to something that is possessed or can be used by two or more people or in two or more situations. <B><FONT color=blue>Mutual</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>reciprocal</FONT></B> are close in meaning, suggesting most simply some interaction between two parties, in which the same thing is given and taken on both sides: their <I><FONT color=brown>mutual</FONT></I> respect for each other; a <I><FONT color=brown>reciprocal</FONT></I> lowering of tariffs between the two countries. <I><FONT color=brown>Reciprocal</FONT></I> is the more common term in official or technical contexts. Strictly speaking, neither would be used for groups of three or more unless the indicated relationships were true for every possible combination of two. <I><FONT color=brown>Mutual</FONT></I>, is commonly used for any similarity of interests, views, feelings, even when the relationships are not <I><FONT color=brown>reciprocal</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>mutual</FONT></I> interest in hiking that drew the two boys together; a <I><FONT color=brown>mutual</FONT></I> excitement felt by the whole audience.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Common</FONT></B> escapes the objections that may be levelled at <I><FONT color=brown>mutual</FONT></I>, referring widely to something possessed by two or more people: speaking a <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> language; a <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> interest in silent films. Because <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> can also mean ordinary, or even cheap or debased, the word’s ambiguity sometimes prohibits its use, a fact which may justify the substitution of <I><FONT color=brown>mutual</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>mutual</FONT></I> friend would unmistakably be one that two or more people were friendly with, but a <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> friend might be a vulgar or coarse person.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Joint</FONT></B> exclusively emphasizes the actual possession of something by no more and no less than two people: a <I><FONT color=brown>joint</FONT></I> bank account. Since it suggests a unity, as of two halves within a whole, the word would not point to mere similarity of interests: a <I><FONT color=brown>joint</FONT></I> business venture in which both put up an equal amount of capital. <B><FONT color=blue>Interchangeable</FONT></B> involves a different concept altogether, applying to parts or elements that can be moved from one setting to another without loss of function or can be used one in place of the other: standardized shaving heads that are <I><FONT color=brown>interchangeable</FONT></I> from one model of electric razor to another. [Jackass and kookaburra are <I><FONT color=brown>interchangeable</FONT></I> words for a well-known Australian bird.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shared</FONT></B> gives a tone of even greater emotional warmth than is true for <I><FONT color=brown>mutual</FONT></I>; it also can indicate something actually divided up and used by two or more people: our <I><FONT color=brown>shared</FONT></I> lunch of bread and cheese. More generally, it can replace both <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>mutual</FONT></I> in many contexts, often with a gained clarity or sense of intimacy: our <I><FONT color=brown>shared</FONT></I> language; pointing out that <I><FONT color=brown>shared</FONT></I> interests often lead to marriage. In some cases the word would be unsuitable: a <I><FONT color=brown>shared</FONT></I> friend.

<B><FONT color=blue>mystical</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mysterious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>occult</FONT></B>:

<P>These words have to do with matter beyond the range of one’s ordinary knowledge, perception or understanding, with the added suggestion of things kept secret or hidden from all but an initiated few. <B><FONT color=blue>Mystical</FONT></B> emphasizes the idea of a direct, intuitive, deeply personal revelation, especially one of a spiritual or religious nature: the <I><FONT color=brown>mystical</FONT></I> visions of Saint Teresa of Avila; John Donne’s <I><FONT color=brown>mystical</FONT></I> poems; a <I><FONT color=brown>mystical</FONT></I> belief in life after death.</P><P>An occurrence or phenomenon is <B><FONT color=blue>mysterious</FONT></B> if it contains elements that arouse one’s wonder, stimulate one’s curiosity, and baffle one’s efforts to explain it: the <I><FONT color=brown>mysterious</FONT></I> universe; a <I><FONT color=brown>mysterious</FONT></I> ailment; the <I><FONT color=brown>mysterious</FONT></I> properties of a new drug. Here the possibility of a rational explanation remains, the obscurity being the result of inadequate rather than unobtainable knowledge.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Occult</FONT></B>, as the word suggests, means hidden or concealed and has come to be applied chiefly to magical arts and practices, such as astrology, alchemy, divination. These who were versed in such secret matters were said to have occult powers, not to be freely divulged to others and exerted only under special conditions, usually determined by themselves. Thus, while one may speak of an experience as <I><FONT color=brown>mysterious</FONT></I> where the causes are unknown but ascertainable, as <I><FONT color=brown>mystical</FONT></I> when it is unique, spontaneous and usually incommunicable, <I><FONT color=brown>occult</FONT></I> implies some agency unknown in human experience without whose deliberate intervention something would not have occurred.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bizarre">BIZARRE</A>, <A href="entry://Obscure">OBSCURE</A>, <A href="entry://Supernatural">SUPERNATURAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: empirical, <A href="entry://Plain">PLAIN</A>.</P>

<P>All these words refer to the written or verbal account of an occurrence, whether teal or imaginary. <B><FONT color=blue>Narrative</FONT></B> is the most formal and general of these; it can serve to categorize whatever has as its impulse the recounting of events rather than the lyrical expression of felling or the evocation of mood, character or place: forms of <I><FONT color=brown>narrative</FONT></I> in Elizabethan prose. More specifically, it can refer to a recitation or recounting of actual events: a day-by-day <I><FONT color=brown>narrative</FONT></I> telling his personal experiences during the journey. Sometimes it is used humorously for a long-winded telling of grievances or past miseries: a long, rambling <I><FONT color=brown>narrative</FONT></I> of the ways her various husbands had mistreated her. Often, particularly as a generic term, it appears as an adjective <I><FONT color=brown>narrative</FONT></I> poetry; <I><FONT color=brown>narrative</FONT></I> skill in prose fiction.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Story</FONT></B> can function as an informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>narrative</FONT></I> in many instances: the <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> of her narrow escape from the Nazis. Often, the word indicates an account of fictional occurrences, clearly understood as such, told for the entertainment of a hearer or reader: He improvised a bedtime <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> for his daughter. In reference to written fiction, the word serves as a literary category, indicating a compact prose form, the short <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I>, or refers to the narrative element in any writing: reviewers who feel compelled to retell a novel’s <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> before appraising it. Because of the word’s reference to fictional accounts, it can be used for any explanation, possibly false, such as an alibi: a <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> she invented to explain why she was late; the suspect’s <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tale</FONT></B> can relate to this last use of <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I>, applying to any exaggerated version of events, whether told to deceive or amuse: a tall <I><FONT color=brown>tale</FONT></I> about his life as a gigolo. The word can also categorize one kind of literary <I><FONT color=brown>narrative</FONT></I> ?a recital by s storyteller, in poetry or prose, of actual, fictional, legendary or allegorical events: The Canterbury <I><FONT color=brown>Tales</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Yarn</FONT></B> is the most informal of these words and usually indicates a colourful <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> or tall <I><FONT color=brown>tale</FONT></I>, whether composed of embroidered truth or outright fiction; the word implies that the <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>tale</FONT></I> is told orally or imitates such a telling: Mark Twain’s <I><FONT color=brown>yarn</FONT></I> about the Jumping Frog of Calaveras Country. <I><FONT color=brown>Yarn</FONT></I> can also mean an informal exchange of stories or <I><FONT color=brown>tales</FONT></I> among two or more people: They had a long <I><FONT color=brown>yarn</FONT></I> about their old shearing days together. In some circumstances it can be used as a slang term for a serious discussion: Come round tonight and we'll have a <I><FONT color=brown>yarn</FONT></I> about next year’s advertising appropriation. <B><FONT color=blue>Anecdote</FONT></B> can refer to any compact <I><FONT color=brown>narrative</FONT></I>, spoken or written, true or fictional; the word suggests greater brevity than would be the case for either a <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>tale</FONT></I>, but it is otherwise very general in its application: an <I><FONT color=brown>anecdote</FONT></I> about something that happened to her daughter at the university; a novel constantly interrupted by pointless <I><FONT color=brown>anecdotes</FONT></I> and other digressions.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Myth</FONT></B> indicates a narrative, in whatever form, that recounts the doings of gods, heroes and humans before the dawn of history. The <I><FONT color=brown>myths</FONT></I> of a given culture were usually taken seriously as religious explanations of the supernatural origin of the society, although later writers and artists may elaborate upon these myths or create new ones without ever giving them credence: Greek <I><FONT color=brown>myths</FONT></I>; Scandinavian <I><FONT color=brown>myths</FONT></I>; Aboriginal <I><FONT color=brown>myths</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>legend</FONT></B> may include elements of <I><FONT color=brown>myth</FONT></I>, but is a more extended recounting in some set form of fabled happenings, whether these are given credence by author and audience or are accepted as fictions. Often, <I><FONT color=brown>legends</FONT></I>, may derive from a period later than the creation of <I><FONT color=brown>myth</FONT></I> and may have an underpinning of historical truth: <I><FONT color=brown>legends</FONT></I> that grew up around the exploits of Richard the Lion-Hearted. Sometimes, the word can refer to present-day <I><FONT color=brown>stories</FONT></I> that have evolved to explain local events or customs: a persistent <I><FONT color=brown>legend</FONT></I> that the vacant house on the hill was haunted. <B><FONT color=blue>Saga</FONT></B> refers to an extended narrative that mixes <I><FONT color=brown>myth</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>legend</FONT></I> to recount the epic <I><FONT color=brown>story</FONT></I> of demigods or heroes: the Volsunga <I><FONT color=brown>Saga</FONT></I>. Less specifically, the word can refer to any epic chronicle, whether fictional or historical: "The Forsyte <I><FONT color=brown>Saga</FONT></I>"; a <I><FONT color=brown>saga</FONT></I> of the Napoleonic wars. Used even more loosely, the word can refer to any long-winded oral narrative about past experiences.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Allegory">ALLEGORY</A>, <A href="entry://History">HISTORY</A>, <A href="entry://Novel">NOVEL</A>, <A href="entry://Report">REPORT</A>, <A href="entry://Tell">TELL</A>.</P>

<P>These words designate persons or things that belong to the place in which they are found or in which they originated. That which is born or produced in a specific region or country is <B><FONT color=blue>native</FONT></B> to it: a <I><FONT color=brown>native</FONT></I> New Zealander; architecture <I><FONT color=brown>native</FONT></I> to Scandinavia; birds <I><FONT color=brown>native</FONT></I> to South America.

<P>These words refer to good grooming or to systematic arrangements. <B><FONT color=blue>Orderly</FONT></B> is the most general and least formal of these words. In terms of something well-cared for, it refers more to places or things than to personal appearance: an <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> array of law books; an <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> studio. The word suggests a considerable mass of details that without deliberate efforts at arrangement can easily become disarrayed. Clarity may be the motivating factor behind such an effort: an <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> presentation of the points to be discussed. But the word can indicate superficial rather than meaningful arrangement: an <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> but not very searching mind. <B><FONT color=blue>Tidy</FONT></B> need not imply the arrangement of as many details as <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> but it does suggest greater adherence to the arrangement chosen even to the point of possible severity or rigidity: a pleasant, <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> playroom where the boys were busy building a model aircraft; a room so <I><FONT color=brown>tidy</FONT></I> that it seemed doubtful that anyone actually lived in it. Sometimes, the word can suggest a happy, feminine touch, but it can sometimes point to primness instead: a <I><FONT color=brown>tidy</FONT></I> bedroom with pink curtains and a simple dressing table; a school teacher who kept scolding her children about keeping their desks <I><FONT color=brown>tidy</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Neat</FONT></B> applies much like <I><FONT color=brown>tidy</FONT></I>, but without the latter’s possibly unfavourable implications. Unlike the previous pair, <I><FONT color=brown>neat</FONT></I> applies as well to personal appearance as to places and things. In any case it suggests careful, uncluttered arrangements or simple, fastidious good grooming: a <I><FONT color=brown>neat</FONT></I> kitchen; wearing a <I><FONT color=brown>neat</FONT></I>, newly pressed skirt; He was always <I><FONT color=brown>neat</FONT></I> in everything he did. But <I><FONT color=brown>neat</FONT></I>, like the preceding words, need not imply cleanliness, as can be seen from the common phrase, <I><FONT color=brown>neat</FONT></I> and clean. Something may be carefully arranged and yet not clean, although the two very often go hand in hand: The room was as <I><FONT color=brown>neat</FONT></I> as she had left it, although dust had settled over everything, a room that had been left <I><FONT color=brown>neat</FONT></I> and sparkling by our maid. <B><FONT color=blue>Trim</FONT></B> contrasts with orderly by emphasizing a sparseness rather than a quantity of detail; it also points to simplicity, compactness and precision: the <I><FONT color=brown>trim</FONT></I>, well-tailored lines of her suit; the man’s <I><FONT color=brown>trim</FONT></I> haircut; a row of <I><FONT color=brown>trim</FONT></I> holiday cottages. In reference to physique, the word suggests a healthy, appealing slimness: the girl’s <I><FONT color=brown>trim</FONT></I> figure; the swimmer’s <I><FONT color=brown>trim</FONT></I> body.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Natty</FONT></B> applies mainly to personal appearance, particularly to clothing, and may be more relevant to men than to women. It is often used humorously to indicate something extremely stylish, even something over-elegant: a dinner suit with <I><FONT color=brown>natty</FONT></I> silk lapel; the teddy boy’s <I><FONT color=brown>natty</FONT></I> Edwardian clothes.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clean">CLEAN</A>, <A href="entry://Exquisite">EXQUISITE</A>, <A href="entry://Stylish">STYLISH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: chaotic, disorderly, messy, untidy.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>neighbouring</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>abutting</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>adjacent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>adjoining</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>contiguous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>juxtaposed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>semi-detached</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to things near by or to things that touch each other. <B><FONT color=blue>Neighbouring</FONT></B> is the most informal of these and suggests only that things are close to each other but not necessarily touching: a shopping centre that drew its customers from the <I><FONT color=brown>neighbouring</FONT></I> communities; no one in the <I><FONT color=brown>neighbouring</FONT></I> flats was awakened by the sounds. <B><FONT color=blue>Adjoining</FONT></B> indicates a closer relationship than <I><FONT color=brown>neighbouring</FONT></I>, suggesting a side-by-side placement having a common boundary: asking the hotel for adjoining rooms with a door between them; French doors that revealed the <I><FONT color=brown>adjoining</FONT></I> patio. <B><FONT color=blue>Abutting</FONT></B> indicates an even closer relationship than adjoining, stressing an actual touching of elements, although not necessarily a side-by-side placement. The special implication here is of things placed together by design to gain strength or structural soundness: the wall and its abutting chimney-piece; a pattern of <I><FONT color=brown>abutting</FONT></I> breakwaters. When these implications are not present, the word functions much as <I><FONT color=brown>adjoining</FONT></I>, except that it does not necessarily suggest a side-by-side relation: a number of chapels <I><FONT color=brown>abutting</FONT></I> the apse of the cathedral. In describing two houses or buildings, semi-detached involves even closer contact than <I><FONT color=brown>abutting</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>adjoining</FONT></I> because there is usually a wall common to both buildings: They lived in a semi-detached cottage in Paddington. <B><FONT color=blue>Contiguous</FONT></B> is more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>adjoining</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>abutting</FONT></I> and is much less specific about the actual placement of elements that it refers to. Thus any kind of contact whatsoever can be indicated: back-door gardens that were <I><FONT color=brown>contiguous</FONT></I> to each other; a hallway that was <I><FONT color=brown>contiguous</FONT></I> to all the rooms of the flat.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Adjacent</FONT></B> can suggest a relationship like that indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>neighbouring</FONT></I>: an explosion that brought people pouring out of the <I><FONT color=brown>adjacent</FONT></I> houses. It can also indicate the sharing of a common boundary in a side-by-side arrangement, as in the geometry term: <I><FONT color=brown>adjacent</FONT></I> angles; <I><FONT color=brown>adjacent</FONT></I> blocks of land. But the word has a special use to indicate things of the same kind that do not touch but are not separated from each other by things like them: <I><FONT color=brown>adjacent</FONT></I> farmhouses. <B><FONT color=blue>Juxtaposed</FONT></B> also has use distinct from those of other words here. While it can function like <I><FONT color=brown>neighbouring</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>adjoining</FONT></I>, it specifically suggests incongruous elements brought into close contact; the word often carries connotations of conflict, abruptness of placement, or surprise at contrasts: a city in which ancient and modern features are strikingly <I><FONT color=brown>juxtaposed</FONT></I>; opposing forces that found themselves <I><FONT color=brown>juxtaposed</FONT></I> the next morning on either side of the broad river.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boundary">BOUNDARY</A>, <A href="entry://Edge">EDGE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dispersed, far-flung, scattered, separated, unattached, unconnected.</P>

<P>These words refer to the development of abnormal cells, usually in tissue masses, in a living organism. <B><FONT color=blue>Neoplasm</FONT></B> is the most comprehensive term for any such development, whether malignant or benign, small or large, active or dormant, temporary or permanent. Usually the word refers to a tissue mass: <I><FONT color=brown>neoplasms</FONT></I> of the cervix, uterus and ovaries. But the word can also refer to the abnormal production of circulating cells. [Leukaemia is a malignant <I><FONT color=brown>neoplasm</FONT></I> of the blood; Hodgkin’s disease is a comparable <I><FONT color=brown>neoplasm</FONT></I> of the lymph cells.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tumour</FONT></B> is the medical term and <B><FONT color=blue>growth</FONT></B> the layman’s term for any neoplasm that takes the form of a compact tissue mass. <I><FONT color=brown>Growth</FONT></I> is, of course, vague in its application to any swelling or non-functional mass: a <I><FONT color=brown>growth</FONT></I> on his vocal cords. <I><FONT color=brown>Tumour</FONT></I> refers specifically to a circumscribed <I><FONT color=brown>growth</FONT></I> that is non-inflammatory, useless to the body, and continues to develop independently of the normal rate for the tissue in which it arises: a breast <I><FONT color=brown>tumour</FONT></I>; a lung <I><FONT color=brown>tumour</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Tumour</FONT></I>, like growth and <I><FONT color=brown>neoplasm</FONT></I>, need not indicate malignancy. <B><FONT color=blue>Cyst</FONT></B> refers specifically to an abnormal but not necessarily malignant sac containing fluid or semi-solid material; a <I><FONT color=brown>cyst</FONT></I> can result from the clogging of a duct and is often temporary or minor in nature: a sebaceous <I><FONT color=brown>cyst</FONT></I>.</P><P>The remaining words all refer strictly to malignant neoplasms. <B><FONT color=blue>Cancer</FONT></B> indicates a disease in which cells stop functioning normally, become destructive of other cells and multiply rapidly. Most often this cellular malfunction is initially localized, becoming apparent when it produces a <I><FONT color=brown>tumour</FONT></I>, and then at last spreading unpredictably from one part of the body to another. Unless it is interrupted by surgery, X-ray treatment or drugs, the result is usually fatal: lung <I><FONT color=brown>cancer</FONT></I>; stomach <I><FONT color=brown>cancer</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Cancer</FONT></I> need not always begin as a <I><FONT color=brown>tumour</FONT></I>; sometimes leukaemia and Hodgkin’s disease are spoken of as cancers of the blood and lymph, even when no <I><FONT color=brown>tumour</FONT></I> is involved.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Carcinoma</FONT></B> refers specifically to a malignant <I><FONT color=brown>tumour</FONT></I> of an organ’s epithelial tissue, that is, the sheet-like membranes enclosing or lining it. <B><FONT color=blue>Sarcoma</FONT></B>, by contrast, is a malignant <I><FONT color=brown>neoplasm</FONT></I> of the body tissues themselves, particularly of the muscles or bones. The distinction is important since surgery is more often successful in completely eradicating the localized <I><FONT color=brown>carcinoma</FONT></I>, at least in its early stages, than the <I><FONT color=brown>sarcoma</FONT></I>, which can more readily begin spreading to other parts of the body.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Mole">MOLE</A>, <A href="entry://Wart">WART</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>nervous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>edgy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>excitable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fidgety</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>flighty</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>jittery</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>jumpy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>on edge</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>restless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>uptight</FONT></B>:

<P>All these terms imply a state of tension, anxiety or worry. <B><FONT color=blue>Nervous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>restless</FONT></B> are probably the most general words, but, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I> refers to an inward condition, <I><FONT color=brown>restless</FONT></I> suggests an outward manifestation of anxiety. A person can be inwardly <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I> and outwardly calm, but if he is restless he shows it in such ways as shifting from one foot to the other, getting up and sitting down, or pacing the room. <I><FONT color=brown>Restless</FONT></I> may also be used figuratively, suggesting the free inquiring attitude of the scientist or the adventurer: a <I><FONT color=brown>restless</FONT></I> mind, never satisfied with easy generalizations; His <I><FONT color=brown>restless</FONT></I> spirit urged him on to ever greater feats. In this sense <I><FONT color=brown>restless</FONT></I> often has a somewhat strained rhetorical ring. <I><FONT color=brown>Restless</FONT></I> more usually describes a temporary condition called into play by a particular situation. A person may be <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I> by disposition and not because of any particular anxiety: My mother is a <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I> woman and always has been.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Edgy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>jumpy</FONT></B> both indicate an extremely nervous state, and are somewhat more informal than either <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>restless</FONT></I>. An <I><FONT color=brown>edgy</FONT></I> person is irritable and combative, ready to take offence at slight provocation, whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>jumpy</FONT></I> person is simply extremely <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I>, literally ready to jump. In this sense <I><FONT color=brown>jumpy</FONT></I> is synonymous with on edge, although one is usually kept on edge waiting for important news, whereas one is <I><FONT color=brown>jumpy</FONT></I> because one compulsively anticipates being shocked or surprised. [The day I start catching a cold I feel very <I><FONT color=brown>edgy</FONT></I>, ready to snap at everyone; We were kept on edge for weeks, waiting to hear from our son in Vietnam; The ex-serviceman still got a little <I><FONT color=brown>jumpy</FONT></I> whenever he heard a car back-firing.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fidgety</FONT></B>, more than the other words so far discussed, suggests <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I> body movements, especially small aimless gestures with the hands. It thus simply refers to an outward sign of inward nervousness or apprehension: The <I><FONT color=brown>fidgety</FONT></I> professor played with his glasses as he lectured. The word usually applies to people who habitually fidget ?fussy people, worriers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Jittery</FONT></B>, deriving from the slang expression "the <I><FONT color=brown>jitters</FONT></I>," is also marked by a number of body movements, but <I><FONT color=brown>jittery</FONT></I> often suggests fright as well as nervousness. A <I><FONT color=brown>jittery</FONT></I> condition may be caused by a menacing or dangerous situation: The thieves became <I><FONT color=brown>jittery</FONT></I> when they heard the news bulletin describing them accurately in detail. Animals may be <I><FONT color=brown>jittery</FONT></I> as well as people: The horses became <I><FONT color=brown>jittery</FONT></I> upon smelling the smoke. Both <I><FONT color=brown>jittery</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fidgety</FONT></I> carry connotations of <I><FONT color=brown>restless</FONT></I> but the movements involved are always quicker and sharper.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Excitable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>flighty</FONT></B> are alike in suggesting enduring temperamental qualities of human beings. <I><FONT color=brown>Flighty</FONT></I> implies an inability to keep one’s attention fixed in a level-headed manner on any one particular subject. The <I><FONT color=brown>flighty</FONT></I> person keeps skipping from subject to subject in a nervous, virtually random manner that suggests the flitting of a butterfly. It often indicates a shallow mind easily distracted by inconsequential events: The conversation of the women was so <I><FONT color=brown>flighty</FONT></I> that there was simply no way to discover what they were talking about. <I><FONT color=brown>Flighty</FONT></I> also has the sense of flirtatiousness and of quickly changing affections. An <I><FONT color=brown>excitable</FONT></I> person is one who is easily aroused to a high pitch of enthusiasm or emotion. <I><FONT color=brown>Excitable</FONT></I> may be applied to persons of either sex, but is usually confined to the young or inexperienced. [He was of an <I><FONT color=brown>excitable</FONT></I> nature; at the slightest hint of criticism he would stamp out the door in a rage.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Uptight</FONT></B> is a recent U.S. fad word for <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I>. In its earlier slang use among jazz musicians, it referred to an opposite feeling of being so sure of oneself that one could play without sheet music. Through misunderstanding, the word now applies generally to someone who is tense, anxious or disturbed, either because of a specific problem or a <I><FONT color=brown>nervous</FONT></I> disposition: a crowd students who are uptight about police "brutality"; hippies who criticize the <I><FONT color=brown>uptight</FONT></I> world of their middle-class parents.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Afraid">AFRAID</A>, <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>, <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Flinch">FLINCH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: composed, <A href="entry://Imperturbable">IMPERTURBABLE</A>, self-controlled, self-possessed, steady, <A href="entry://Tranquil">TRANQUIL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a matching of one extreme with another so that a stable or static situation results. <B><FONT color=blue>Neutralize</FONT></B> suggests that this stability is achieved by adding a substance that will cause a change in the nature of something: an alkali that will <I><FONT color=brown>neutralize</FONT></I> the excessive acidity of the soil; an antidote to <I><FONT color=brown>neutralize</FONT></I> the poison. The word often suggests that some danger or threat is rendered harmless: government housing projects to <I><FONT color=brown>neutralize</FONT></I> the effects of slum living. The word can, however, refer to the frustrating of some positive tendency: the doubt and suspicions that surrounded him and <I><FONT color=brown>neutralized</FONT></I> all his efforts to make peace.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Counteract</FONT></B> is more forceful than <I><FONT color=brown>neutralize</FONT></I> because it suggests an act that not only restores things as they were, but that may carry the action past that point into the opposite direction: They worked vigorously to <I><FONT color=brown>counteract</FONT></I> his apathy; pills to <I><FONT color=brown>counteract</FONT></I> her anaemia by building up her red blood cells. <B><FONT color=blue>Counterbalance</FONT></B>, or balance, literally suggests an equalizing of one weight by another: <I><FONT color=brown>counterbalancing</FONT></I> the demands of labour and management with a concern for the nation’s welfare.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Offset</FONT></B> suggests most specifically the replacing of something lost by a new thing equivalent to it: <I><FONT color=brown>offsetting</FONT></I> his losses at the races by his successes in share speculations; The low selling price more than <I><FONT color=brown>offset</FONT></I> the disadvantages of the house.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Beneficial">BENEFICIAL</A>, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>, <A href="entry://Treat">TREAT</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote various types of acquired or derived knowledge.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>News</FONT></B> is knowledge of recent events or developments of interest to the public at large, especially as reported in newspaper or in a radio or television broadcast. <I><FONT color=brown>News</FONT></I> may also be the report or broadcast itself. [The <I><FONT color=brown>news</FONT></I> from Italy is that spring floods have severely damaged the crops; Each night after dinner we like to listen to the <I><FONT color=brown>news</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>News</FONT></I> may also be something of which one did not previously know, or recent doings of which one hasn’t heard. [What you have just told us about the company being in financial trouble is <I><FONT color=brown>news</FONT></I> to me; Please write and tell me all the <I><FONT color=brown>news</FONT></I> about yourself.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Information</FONT></B> is the most general term and is applied to any knowledge acquired from observation, from reading or study, or from talking with others. Although such knowledge is often accepted as valid, it may not necessarily be true or accurate. [The old lady gathers <I><FONT color=brown>information</FONT></I> about her neighbours by spying on them through the window curtains; A hysterical person at the scene of an accident is a poor source of <I><FONT color=brown>information</FONT></I> as to what happened.] <I><FONT color=brown>Information</FONT></I> is also timely or specific knowledge about an event or subject of interest: a photographic journal containing not only technical articles and news of club activities but also information on the latest cameras and equipment; Before leading his men into combat, the lieutenant called headquarters for <I><FONT color=brown>information</FONT></I> as to the enemy’s position.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Facts</FONT></B> are pieces of information that are known by observation or proof to be true or real.

In a restricted sense, <I><FONT color=brown>intelligence</FONT></I> is the collecting of secret <I><FONT color=brown>information</FONT></I> about an enemy or a suspected person or organization, as by political police, a government agency, or military authorities: an <I><FONT color=brown>intelligence</FONT></I> bureau; an officer in <I><FONT color=brown>intelligence</FONT></I>.

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Noise</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sound</FONT></B> are both general words which designate sensations excited in the ear. <I><FONT color=brown>Sound</FONT></I> is most general, embracing sensations of all qualities, whether loud or soft, pleasant or unpleasant, significant or insignificant: the soft, sibilant <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I> of two young girls whispering in class; the horrifying <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I> of a scream in the night; the different <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I> that two conductors can evoke from one orchestra. <I><FONT color=brown>Noise</FONT></I>, though more specific than <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I>, is general in its application to all loud, confused or irritating <I><FONT color=brown>sounds</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Noise</FONT></I> may consist high-intensity <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I> from a single source, <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I> that is loud, harsh, sharp, shrill, strident or grating; the <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I> of a circular saw; the <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I> of a vacuum cleaner. Or it may be a confused commingling of clashing <I><FONT color=brown>sounds</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I> of a construction project, with all the hammering and drilling, the whine of machinery, the shouts of the men. In one sense, <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I> may be part of the largely unnoticed natural background of existence: office <I><FONT color=brown>noises</FONT></I>. In another sense, <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I> may designate distracting <I><FONT color=brown>sounds</FONT></I> that annoy because of special sensitivity or circumstances. [The <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I> of crumpled chocolate wrappers spoiled the movie’s most dramatic scene; I’m trying to study, please stop rocking that chair ?you're making so much <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I>.] The word <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I> may also be applied to neutral <I><FONT color=brown>sounds</FONT></I> that are merely perceived and noted: the soothing <I><FONT color=brown>noise</FONT></I> of water falling; She makes little groaning <I><FONT color=brown>noises</FONT></I> in her sleep.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Din</FONT></B> denotes loud noise that goes on without pause, often with maddening or deafening effect. It implies an inescapable onslaught of <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I>, sometimes involving a painful assault on the eardrums: the shattering din of a jackhammer; the earsplitting din of a factory. <B><FONT color=blue>Blare</FONT></B> is a loud, brassy sound of constant, unremitting intensity. It impinges on the privacy and preoccupies the consciousness: the <I><FONT color=brown>blare</FONT></I> of a loud radio; the <I><FONT color=brown>blare</FONT></I> of a car horn that is tuck. <B><FONT color=blue>Clatter</FONT></B> indicates a rattling <I><FONT color=brown>sound</FONT></I> or a rapid succession of short, sharp noises: the <I><FONT color=brown>clatter</FONT></I> of a cart on cobble-stones; the <I><FONT color=brown>clatter</FONT></I> of a typewriter.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hubbub</FONT></B> designates a general, confused noise, as of many voices busily talking at once: the <I><FONT color=brown>hubbub</FONT></I> in the courtroom before the judge calls for order; the <I><FONT color=brown>hubbub</FONT></I> of the marketplace or stock exchange. <I><FONT color=brown>Hubbub</FONT></I> may also refer to any noise arising from hustle and bustle: He tried to make himself heard above the <I><FONT color=brown>hubbub</FONT></I> of a busy intersection. <B><FONT color=blue>Clamour</FONT></B> implies a loud outcry kept up by insistent voices. It is often expressive of a vehement public protest or demand: the furious <I><FONT color=brown>clamour</FONT></I> of the hungry mob; the <I><FONT color=brown>clamour</FONT></I> of the press for reform; the public <I><FONT color=brown>clamour</FONT></I> for repeal of the law.

[<I><FONT color=brown>Normal</FONT></I> body temperature ranges between 96.8<FONT face=Symbol>°</FONT> and 98.6<FONT face=Symbol>°</FONT> Fahrenheit; <I><FONT color=brown>Normal</FONT></I> temperature in Sydney in June is about 55<FONT face=Symbol>°</FONT> .] <B><FONT color=blue>Regular</FONT></B> implies accordance with some rule, plan or method: to follow <I><FONT color=brown>regular</FONT></I> army procedures.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Typical</FONT></B> indicates possession of those properties or characteristics that distinguish a particular class of things from all other classes of things: the <I><FONT color=brown>typical</FONT></I> clubbed antennae of the butterfly.

<P>These words refer to a loss of sensation, ability to move, or mental responsiveness. <B><FONT color=blue>Numb</FONT></B>, the most informal of these, is primarily related to loss of sensation that is brought about by any means whatever: hands that were <I><FONT color=brown>numb</FONT></I> with cold; her tongue still <I><FONT color=brown>numb</FONT></I> from the injection of novocaine; a leg <I><FONT color=brown>numb</FONT></I> from his having sat to long in one position. More metaphorically, the word suggests loss of feeling or mental alertness: tragic news that left him <I><FONT color=brown>numb</FONT></I>; looking at the questionnaire with <I><FONT color=brown>numb</FONT></I> bewilderment. <B><FONT color=blue>Anaesthetized</FONT></B> is the most formal and most specific of these words, referring to loss of sensation, if not of movement or consciousness, as well; it specifically suggests a medical use of drugs to make someone incapable of feeling pain: taking a pulse count of the <I><FONT color=brown>anaesthetized</FONT></I> patient; the <I><FONT color=brown>anaesthetized</FONT></I> side of his mouth. Used metaphorically, it functions much like <I><FONT color=brown>numb</FONT></I>, but with greater intensity: wondering if her dull, <I><FONT color=brown>anaesthetized</FONT></I> manner was the result of a tragic loss or an unhappy love affair.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deadened</FONT></B> may, more informally, indicate an anaesthetized condition: working with a drill on the <I><FONT color=brown>deadened</FONT></I> tooth. In other uses it is more like <I><FONT color=brown>numb</FONT></I>, but may suggest a partial, as well as complete, loss of sensation or movement: hearing that had been <I><FONT color=brown>deadened</FONT></I> slightly by the blast; nerve damage that had permanently <I><FONT color=brown>deadened</FONT></I> both legs. In terms of mental responsiveness, the word suggests an acutely apathetic and depressed state of discouragement or hopelessness: minds <I><FONT color=brown>deadened</FONT></I> by conformity; <I><FONT color=brown>deadened</FONT></I> expectations. <B><FONT color=blue>Paralysed</FONT></B> takes up one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>deadened</FONT></I> exclusively, referring to a loss of ability to move: learning to walk with a brace on the <I><FONT color=brown>paralysed</FONT></I> leg. Used of emotions or mental states, it suggests the absence of will or the inability to function: <I><FONT color=brown>paralysed</FONT></I> with fear. It can even be used jocosely for total unconsciousness: drinking until he was <I><FONT color=brown>paralysed</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Insensible</FONT></B>, at its most formal and precise, refers exclusively to loss of sensation: a local <I><FONT color=brown>anaesthetic</FONT></I> to render the area insensible to pain. More loosely, it can simply suggest resistance to rigorous sensation: Eskimos amazingly <I><FONT color=brown>insensible</FONT></I> to cold. In another context, it refers to unawareness, rather than to sensation loss: talking on, <I><FONT color=brown>insensible</FONT></I> of her forbidding frown. It may also refer to complete unconsciousness: falling <I><FONT color=brown>insensible</FONT></I> to the floor. It has little application to mental states. This contrasts sharply with <B><FONT color=blue>stupefied</FONT></B>, which is almost exclusively restricted to describing states of shock or incoherence: <I><FONT color=brown>stupefied</FONT></I> with disbelief; giving his alarm clock a <I><FONT color=brown>stupefied</FONT></I> scowl. It contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>numb</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>anaesthetized</FONT></I> in this context by stressing surprise or mental befuddlement rather than a draining away of feeling. It contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>deadened</FONT></I> by stressing confusion of mind rather than dullness. And it contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>paralysed</FONT></I> by suggesting a partial, though bleared, consciousness rather than a non-functioning one.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impassive">IMPASSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Listless">LISTLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Sloth">SLOTH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aware">AWARE</A>, <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>.</P>

<P>These words all share the meaning of looking after or taking care of someone or something. <B><FONT color=blue>Nurse</FONT></B> is specifically applied to looking after the sick, injured or infirm: His wife patiently <I><FONT color=brown>nursed</FONT></I> him back to health after his heart attack. In this sense it implies intimate care and close, devoted supervision, although it may also refer to a more formal and professional relationship, as that between a trained nurse and patient. <B><FONT color=blue>Tend</FONT></B> may imply devoted concern, but it is a concern based more upon one’s sense of duty, charity or religious conviction than upon one’s personal feeling for the individual being helped. [It is the duty of physicians to <I><FONT color=brown>tend</FONT></I> the sick; The doctor selflessly <I><FONT color=brown>tended</FONT></I> (or, more informally, <I><FONT color=brown>tended to</FONT></I>) the wounded soldiers before dressing his own wound.] <I><FONT color=brown>Tend</FONT></I> may also apply to things, thus emphasizing its essentially impersonal connotation: to <I><FONT color=brown>tend</FONT></I> machinery; to <I><FONT color=brown>tend</FONT></I> a boiler.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Minister</FONT></B> is close in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>tend</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>nurse</FONT></I>, but today it often sounds somewhat rhetorical or stuffy when applied exclusively to the care of the sick. It is more often applied nowadays to general wants, especially to spiritual succour, and even in such contexts it is a more formal word than <I><FONT color=brown>tend</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>nurse</FONT></I>. [An elected representative must <I><FONT color=brown>minister</FONT></I> to the needs and aspirations of his own community, city and nation; As a doctor <I><FONT color=brown>ministers</FONT></I> to the body, so does a clergyman <I><FONT color=brown>minister</FONT></I> to the spirit or soul.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Care for</FONT></B> is the most general term of this group. In the sense here considered, it can mean looking after all the needs of a child, <I><FONT color=brown>tending</FONT></I> an invalid, <I><FONT color=brown>nursing</FONT></I> a convalescent back to health, or <I><FONT color=brown>ministering</FONT></I> to the unwell: The foster mother <I><FONT color=brown>cared for</FONT></I> those boys as faithfully as if they had been her own sons.</P><P>In the sense being compared here, <B><FONT color=blue>mind</FONT></B> means to look after, watch over or take care of. It most often suggests a temporary charge rather than a permanent devotion: to <I><FONT color=brown>mind</FONT></I> someone’s children; to <I><FONT color=brown>mind</FONT></I> sheep; to <I><FONT color=brown>mind</FONT></I> a store while the owner is at lunch.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Pamper">PAMPER</A>, <A href="entry://Protect">PROTECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Slight">SLIGHT</A>.</P>

obedient
<B><FONT color=blue>obedient</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>dutiful</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>good</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>well-behaved</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are alike in meaning morally or intellectually disposed to respect authority or custom and to follow the dictates thereof. <B><FONT color=blue>Obedient</FONT></B> stresses an acknowledgement of the authority vested in some person, organization, etc. the very common usage of obedient in reference to children suggests the nature of the compliance implicit in the word: a soldier who refused to be blindly <I><FONT color=brown>obedient</FONT></I> to the commands of an ignorant superior whose only saving grace was a kind of fatherly good will. Alone among the words being considered here, <I><FONT color=brown>obedient</FONT></I> has an extended application to physical objects that respond to or act in accordance with some superior force or natural law: a ship <I><FONT color=brown>obedient</FONT></I> to the wheel. <B><FONT color=blue>Dutiful</FONT></B>, even more than <I><FONT color=brown>obedient</FONT></I>, suggests the influence of outside conditions, such as ethical demands or those of behavioural customs. <I><FONT color=brown>Dutiful</FONT></I> persons have a strong sense of respect or obligation: a <I><FONT color=brown>dutiful</FONT></I> child; a <I><FONT color=brown>dutiful</FONT></I> parent.</P><P>While <I><FONT color=brown>obedient</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>dutiful</FONT></I> connote a manner of acting that is dependent upon external circumstances, <B><FONT color=blue>good</FONT></B> refers to behaviour that is the result of inner demands. Thus, a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> child is docile by nature, and he is easy to manage or teach because of his own inclination. A <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> worker, in the context of this comparison, is one who follows instructions because of a personal desire to please and do what he is supposed to do.</P><P>Someone who is <B><FONT color=blue>well-behaved</FONT></B> may be that way because of training or because of his own make-up. But the suggestion of outside influence is strong; <I><FONT color=brown>well-behaved</FONT></I> is used to characterize that kind of conduct which has standards established by the society in which a person lives: The new teacher congratulated himself on having a class more than usually <I><FONT color=brown>well-behaved</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adaptable">ADAPTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Compliant">COMPLIANT</A>, <A href="entry://Docile">DOCILE</A>, <A href="entry://Malleable">MALLEABLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in denoting that which one is bound to fulfil or perform. <B><FONT color=blue>Obligation</FONT></B> refers generally to anything that one is compelled to do, or to forbear from doing, by law, contract, promise, morality or the like. The word often implies immediate pressure to carry out, or to refrain from, a particular action: a legal <I><FONT color=brown>obligation</FONT></I> to serve in the armed forces. <B><FONT color=blue>Duty</FONT></B> is often used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>obligation</FONT></I>, but the word more often refers to that which springs from an interior moral or ethical impulse rather than from external demands: he volunteered for the dangerous mission out of a sense of <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Duty</FONT></I> frequently has a more general reference than does <I><FONT color=brown>obligation</FONT></I>: to put <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I> before pleasure. And the word is applied to both a particular task and the general notion of work to be done: My <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I> is to check the inventory; <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I> before pleasure. <B><FONT color=blue>Function</FONT></B> refers to activity demanded by one’s position, profession or the like. It focuses on objective purpose, as discharged in the performance of particular <I><FONT color=brown>duties</FONT></I>: He mechanically performed the <I><FONT color=brown>functions</FONT></I> of a teacher but was uninspired. <B><FONT color=blue>Office</FONT></B>, as here considered, refers to the services, <I><FONT color=brown>functions</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>duties</FONT></I> connected with a position of trust. [He swore to discharge faithfully the <I><FONT color=brown>office</FONT></I> of president; reconciled through the good <I><FONT color=brown>offices</FONT></I> of their clergyman.] <B><FONT color=blue>Responsibility</FONT></B> refers to any <I><FONT color=brown>obligation</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>function</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>office</FONT></I>, for the fulfilment of which one may be called upon to answer to a particular person, the public in general or a Diving Being: it is the <I><FONT color=brown>responsibility</FONT></I> of the Commissioner of Police to maintain law and order.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compel">COMPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Responsible">RESPONSIBLE</A>, <A href="entry://Stint">STINT</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>oblivious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>absent-minded</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>abstracted</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inattentive</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a mind that is lost in thought, lacks alertness or awareness or is given over to some matter other than the one at hand. <B><FONT color=blue>Oblivious</FONT></B> stresses lack of awareness, either because of deep thought or poor concentration: so fascinated with solving the problem that he was <I><FONT color=brown>oblivious</FONT></I> of the odd looks his fellow passengers were giving him; wandering thoughts that made him <I><FONT color=brown>oblivious</FONT></I> of the question the teacher had just asked him. <B><FONT color=blue>Inattentive</FONT></B> stresses exclusively this last possibility of oblivious, indicating an inability to keep the mind focused on the subject before it: <I><FONT color=brown>inattentive</FONT></I> to the demonstration the diving instructor was making of each position. This inability can be the result of restlessness, distraction, weak intellectual powers or even a wilful indifference to detail: children who grow <I><FONT color=brown>inattentive</FONT></I> during long class periods; a bored secretary, <I><FONT color=brown>inattentive</FONT></I> while taking dictation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abstracted</FONT></B> stresses a mind that is far removed from mundane considerations before it, especially because of obsessive or intrusive thoughts and feelings: so <I><FONT color=brown>abstracted</FONT></I> by the beauty of the sunset that he quite forgot about the presence of his companions; the <I><FONT color=brown>abstracted</FONT></I> smile the widow gave to other mourners at the funeral. <B><FONT color=blue>Absent-minded</FONT></B> may function exactly like <I><FONT color=brown>abstracted</FONT></I> at a more informal level. More importantly, it is unique among these words in pointing to a fixed or ingrained tendency to lose one’s bearing because of intrusive concerns: the typical <I><FONT color=brown>absent-minded</FONT></I> professor, rapt in solving an equation while crossing against a red light; An <I><FONT color=brown>absent-minded</FONT></I> movement of his hand caused the cup to fall.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Forget">FORGET</A>, <A href="entry://Preoccupied">PREOCCUPIED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aware">AWARE</A>, <A href="entry://Observant">OBSERVANT</A>.</P>

obnoxious
<B><FONT color=blue>obnoxious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hateful</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>odious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>offensive</FONT></B>:

<P>The words on this list are applied to a person or thing which arouses dislike, distaste, hostility or opposition. <B><FONT color=blue>Obnoxious</FONT></B> is used to refer to that which is extremely disagreeable or even disgusting to one’s personal feelings, ideas or tastes. Very often the reasons for viewing something as obnoxious are largely subjective, but they are nevertheless strong enough to make one try to avoid the <I><FONT color=brown>obnoxious</FONT></I> person or thing. [I can’t stand him ?he’s a thoroughly <I><FONT color=brown>obnoxious</FONT></I> young man who thinks he knows everything.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hateful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>odious</FONT></B> describe that which excites intense dislike or aversion, the former usually suggesting an attendant feeling of enmity, the latter associated with contempt or repugnance. Although the words are sometimes used interchangeably, <I><FONT color=brown>hateful</FONT></I> implies an angry mental response to something that outrages or arouses violent antipathy: the <I><FONT color=brown>hateful</FONT></I> animosity of resentful bigots toward anti-capital punishment campaigners. <I><FONT color=brown>Odious</FONT></I> often suggests something so disgusting that it evokes a physical as well as a moral or intellectual response: getting sick to one’s stomach upon reading of the <I><FONT color=brown>odious</FONT></I> atrocities committed in a Nazi concentration camp.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Offensive</FONT></B> is the mildest word in this list.

<P>These words are applied to persons guilty of behaviour characterized by excessive deference, flattery, imitation or obedience. <B><FONT color=blue>Obsequious</FONT></B> share with <B><FONT color=blue>abject</FONT></B> an awareness of low station or a felling of low self-esteem which reveals itself in fawning behaviour. <I><FONT color=brown>Obsequious</FONT></I> strongly suggests an attitude that is consciously assumed in order to placate a superior in hopes of getting what one wants or to escape unpleasant consequences: serfs who bowed with <I><FONT color=brown>obsequious</FONT></I> politeness to members of the gentry; a failing student who was maddeningly <I><FONT color=brown>obsequious</FONT></I> to his teacher. <I><FONT color=brown>Abject</FONT></I> conveys the sense of being cast down in spirits or a loss of self-respect that results in a humiliated cringing or pitiable fawning on others: to make an <I><FONT color=brown>abject</FONT></I> apology even though one was not at fault; a beggar so <I><FONT color=brown>abject</FONT></I> that he plucks at the sleeves of passers-by. In related sense, <I><FONT color=brown>abject</FONT></I> designates something unusually degraded or wretched: the <I><FONT color=brown>abject</FONT></I> poverty of millions of people in the world.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sycophantic</FONT></B> is sometimes used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>obsequious</FONT></I>, but is more strongly pejorative. The word suggests a parasitical and self-seeking relationship to someone in a superior position, rather than an attitude of sincere respect: a dictator’s <I><FONT color=brown>sycophantic</FONT></I> yes men; the <I><FONT color=brown>sycophantic</FONT></I> women who surround a successful actor.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Menial</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>servile</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>slavish</FONT></B> are applied to extremely abject persons or behaviour. In former times, when class distinctions were more pronounced and rigid, these words were as a matter of course applied to those at the bottom of the scale: a <I><FONT color=brown>menial</FONT></I> servant; a <I><FONT color=brown>servile</FONT></I> jester; a <I><FONT color=brown>slavish</FONT></I> retainer. Nowadays these words are more likely to be applied to action or attitudes: his <I><FONT color=brown>menial</FONT></I> unobtrusiveness; <I><FONT color=brown>servile</FONT></I> obedience; <I><FONT color=brown>slavish</FONT></I> attention to the needs of another.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Subservient</FONT></B> is a somewhat weaker synonym for the other terms in suggesting truckling or servility.

<P>These words describe someone with a sharp eye for detail or a keen ability to detect the real meaning of a situation. <B><FONT color=blue>Observant</FONT></B> suggests someone who notices details that another person might miss: Only the most <I><FONT color=brown>observant</FONT></I> spectator would have seen which player was offside. <B><FONT color=blue>Discerning</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>perceptive</FONT></B> take in this emphasis of <I><FONT color=brown>observant</FONT></I>, but add to it an ability to evaluate or understand the observed details. <I><FONT color=brown>Discerning</FONT></I> stresses the ability to tell apart two or more very similar things ?or to evaluate slight differences by means of one’s inherent good taste: the <I><FONT color=brown>discerning</FONT></I> theatregoer who shuns bad imitations of last year’s successes. <I><FONT color=brown>Perceptive</FONT></I> stresses that ability to understand or make understandable the details one has observed: a <I><FONT color=brown>perceptive</FONT></I> comment on campaigns needed to combat juvenile delinquency.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Attentive</FONT></B> resembles <I><FONT color=brown>observant</FONT></I> more than <I><FONT color=brown>discerning</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>perceptive</FONT></I>; it stresses the ability to concentrate on a matter without distraction or wavering of any kind: students who suddenly become <I><FONT color=brown>attentive</FONT></I> the week before exams; members of Parliament who are <I><FONT color=brown>attentive</FONT></I> to the needs of their constituents. <B><FONT color=blue>Aware</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>alert</FONT></B> also resemble <I><FONT color=brown>observant</FONT></I>, but they are more general than the other words here. In a different context, aware can point merely to being conscious; here it suggests acute responsiveness to other people or to one’s surroundings: discussing how they could become more <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I> of each other’s problems. <I><FONT color=brown>Alert</FONT></I> is similar to, but an intensification of, <I><FONT color=brown>aware</FONT></I>; it suggests a sharp, highly receptive state of mind that is on the look-out for some event to occur, especially a dangerous or threatening event: so <I><FONT color=brown>alert</FONT></I> that not a single error in the report slipped past her; <I><FONT color=brown>alert</FONT></I> for any sign of change in the critically ill patient.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Discriminate">DISCRIMINATE</A>, <A href="entry://Keen">KEEN</A>, <A href="entry://Vision">VISION</A>, <A href="entry://Wisdom">WISDOM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Oblivious">OBLIVIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Preoccupied">PREOCCUPIED</A>, unaware, unmindful.</P>

<P>In the general sense of being independent of or contrary to a person’s conscious will, these words have both a popular and technical use.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Obsessed</FONT></B> is to be excessively troubled, disturbed, worried or preoccupied by virtually anything at any time, anywhere, for whatever reason or cause. [He was <I><FONT color=brown>obsessed</FONT></I> by the fear of cancer; The thought of losing the large order <I><FONT color=brown>obsessed</FONT></I> the new salesman.] <B><FONT color=blue>Obsessive</FONT></B> implies a similar mental state but carries the idea of some deep-lying character defect or personality maladjustment requiring careful, often extended psychiatric attention. Thus one may be temporarily <I><FONT color=brown>obsessed</FONT></I> by unpaid bills or a forgotten address, but have a persistent <I><FONT color=brown>obsessive</FONT></I> fear of debt or of losing one’s memory.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Compulsive</FONT></B> suggests an insistent, unwanted and repetitive emotion, attitude or activity that has little relation to normal standards of behaviour and whose omission leads to acute mental distress: a <I><FONT color=brown>compulsive</FONT></I> need to wash one’s hands or rearrange the furniture; <I><FONT color=brown>compulsive</FONT></I> eating; a <I><FONT color=brown>compulsive</FONT></I> striving for perfection. In this sense it is usually linked with <I><FONT color=brown>obsessive</FONT></I> as a psychiatric term for a large number of mental disorders: an <I><FONT color=brown>obsessive-compulsive</FONT></I> neurosis.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disciplined</FONT></B> is comparable to the other words in this group chiefly as it implies submission to controls imposed either by some outside authority or by oneself. The submission may be involuntary of enforced: <I><FONT color=brown>disciplined</FONT></I> prisoners of war. On the other hand, it may be consciously accepted as a means to some personal end: a <I><FONT color=brown>disciplined</FONT></I> course of action; <I><FONT color=brown>disciplined</FONT></I> behaviour to one’s superiors.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Addicted</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>addictive</FONT></B> both suggest a strong attachment to or dependence upon something. <I><FONT color=brown>Addicted</FONT></I> may often mean little more than a persistent devotion to one or another form of socially acceptable activity or pursuit: <I><FONT color=brown>addicted</FONT></I> to the theatre, to sports, to reading or travel. Usually, however, the word suggests an emotional or physical dependence that is not compatible with normal behaviour: <I><FONT color=brown>addicted</FONT></I> to drugs or alcohol. Such dependence is emphasized by <I><FONT color=brown>addictive</FONT></I>, which has come to mean habit-forming in a bad or unhealthy sense: <I><FONT color=brown>addictive</FONT></I> drugs; <I><FONT color=brown>addictive</FONT></I> narcotics. <B><FONT color=blue>Hooked</FONT></B> is a colloquial term for addicted when applied to drugs in general or to a particular drug: <I><FONT color=brown>hooked</FONT></I> on LSD.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: instinctive, natural, <A href="entry://Spontaneous">SPONTANEOUS</A>.</P>

<P>These words denote anything that checks or halts progress, either in a literal or a figurative sense. <B><FONT color=blue>Obstacle</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>barrier</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>hurdle</FONT></B> present the most trouble in overcoming. An <I><FONT color=brown>obstacle</FONT></I> is something that one must either remove or go round before being able to proceed. [The huge tree that had been blown down by the storm was an <I><FONT color=brown>obstacle</FONT></I> to traffic; Although the boy could speak fluently, his faulty enunciation was an <I><FONT color=brown>obstacle</FONT></I> to his being chosen for the school debating team.] A <I><FONT color=brown>barrier</FONT></I> is an <I><FONT color=brown>obstacle</FONT></I> or obstruction that temporarily impedes progress, but is not necessarily impassable. [Writers never tire of depicting the <I><FONT color=brown>barriers</FONT></I> that arise between parents and growing children; The thick walls and moats of castles were surmount if he is to continue. <I><FONT color=brown>Hurdle</FONT></I> usually suggests challenge and a good probability of success: Every inventor faces many <I><FONT color=brown>hurdles</FONT></I> before his brain-child reaches the market as a finished product.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>bar</FONT></B> may be either a physical obstacle or a condition that prevents entry or passage: the <I><FONT color=brown>bars</FONT></I> of the lion cage; race, colour or creed being no <I><FONT color=brown>bar</FONT></I> to membership. A <B><FONT color=blue>barricade</FONT></B> is always a physical <I><FONT color=brown>obstacle</FONT></I>, and is usually conceived of as being a hastily erected barrier against advancing soldiers, rioters or large crowds.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Impediment</FONT></B>, in its literal meaning, suggests something that entangles the feet and interferes seriously with freedom of action or movement. There is a tendency to view an <I><FONT color=brown>impediment</FONT></I> as more or less permanent. [His speech <I><FONT color=brown>impediment</FONT></I> made it nearly impossible for him to communicate with others; Legal insanity is an <I><FONT color=brown>impediment</FONT></I> to making contracts.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Snag</FONT></B> is literally part of a dead tree which, lodged under the surface of a body of water, may damage boats or impede the flow of water. Figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>snag</FONT></I> points to a hidden <I><FONT color=brown>obstacle</FONT></I> that one comes upon without warning and which is annoying or troublesome but rarely serious: Their plans for going into business sound ideal, but there is sure to be a <I><FONT color=brown>snag</FONT></I> somewhere.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Difficulty</FONT></B> is the most general of the words in this group and may be applied loosely to any troublesome state of affairs: to have <I><FONT color=brown>difficulty</FONT></I> in learning higher mathematics; the <I><FONT color=brown>difficulty</FONT></I> of driving a car through deep mud; to have financial <I><FONT color=brown>difficulties</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Effort">EFFORT</A>, <A href="entry://Thwart">THWART</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Help">HELP</A>.</P>

<P>These words are applied to things to actions that do not occur often. <B><FONT color=blue>Occasional</FONT></B> means happening now and then at irregular intervals, and it carries the idea that recurrence can be expected: to make <I><FONT color=brown>occasional</FONT></I> trips to a museum; to attend an <I><FONT color=brown>occasional</FONT></I> cocktail party. <B><FONT color=blue>Infrequent</FONT></B> means occurring at greater intervals, and it neither suggests nor precludes recurrence: Total solar eclipses are <I><FONT color=brown>infrequent</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rare</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>uncommon</FONT></B> go a step further than <I><FONT color=brown>occasional</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>infrequent</FONT></I> in that they are applied to that which is met with so seldom as to approach the unique. [It is <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> to find wisdom in the young; Snow in Melbourne is an <I><FONT color=brown>uncommon</FONT></I> slight; The kiwi is now <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> in all but some forested parts of New Zealand; That was an <I><FONT color=brown>uncommon</FONT></I> act of charity.] <I><FONT color=brown>Rare</FONT></I> has the added sense of precious: a <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> medieval manuscript; a <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> sapphire.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scattered</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sporadic</FONT></B> both mean occurring in space or time in an irregular or random pattern. <I><FONT color=brown>Scattered</FONT></I> emphasizes things that are part of a group but are situated with large, unequal spaces between them: <I><FONT color=brown>scattered</FONT></I> homesteads on the sheep-grazing plains; <I><FONT color=brown>scattered</FONT></I> showers; <I><FONT color=brown>scattered</FONT></I> applause from a bored audience. On the other hand, <I><FONT color=brown>sporadic</FONT></I> describes things that occur here and there with little or no continuity: <I><FONT color=brown>sporadic</FONT></I> outbreaks of hepatitis; <I><FONT color=brown>sporadic</FONT></I> sniper fire from roof-tops.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: frequent, <A href="entry://Invariable">INVARIABLE</A>, often, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P>

<P>Making services available or giving suggestions is involved in all these words. <B><FONT color=blue>Offer</FONT></B> is the most general; each of the other more specialized words isolates one facet out of its total possibilities. <I><FONT color=brown>Offer</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>volunteer</FONT></B> may both refer to generous extending of aid, services or a desired item; this generosity may or may not follow a specific request from someone who is, in any case, free to reject or accept the gift: <I><FONT color=brown>offering</FONT></I> to do the dishes; freely <I><FONT color=brown>volunteering</FONT></I> information to the bewildered tourist. When a request precedes the act of <I><FONT color=brown>offering</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>volunteering</FONT></I>, the implied situation is usually that of someone asking one or more members of a group to do a task. Those who <I><FONT color=brown>volunteer</FONT></I> agree to do the task by free choice rather than by submission to selection or command: only two trainees naïve enough to <I><FONT color=brown>volunteer</FONT></I> for mess duty.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Offer</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>bid</FONT></B> share the context of a competitive attempt to close a contract. Here, the very opposite of a generous and spontaneous giving is indicated: <I><FONT color=brown>offering</FONT></I> the dealer five dollars less than his asking price for the TV set; <I><FONT color=brown>bidding</FONT></I> low deliberately in the hope that no one would mention a higher sum. Usually the act of <I><FONT color=brown>bidding</FONT></I> follows a request or invitation, but the <I><FONT color=brown>bid</FONT></I> would be accepted only if its terms were the most advantageous of those received. The one who <I><FONT color=brown>offers</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>bids</FONT></I> is committed to the stated terms if acceptance follows.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Offer</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>propose</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>present</FONT></B> all share the context of putting forward ideas or suggestions in argument or discussion. <I><FONT color=brown>Propose</FONT></I> can also be used in a contractual situation, as in <I><FONT color=brown>proposing</FONT></I> marriage, in which case no previous request is implied and no following acceptance or rejection is necessarily certain. But the one who <I><FONT color=brown>proposes</FONT></I> something is bound to follow through if accepted. In the context of argument or discussion, <I><FONT color=brown>propose</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>offer</FONT></I> indicate a much more tentative situation, implying that a course of action has been suggested or a new idea brought forward, not so much to be accepted or rejected as to be explored and possibly shaped by still further discussion: <I><FONT color=brown>offering</FONT></I> a new slant on the problem; <I><FONT color=brown>proposing</FONT></I> several possibilities for coping with the crisis; <I><FONT color=brown>presenting</FONT></I> the pertinent facts without comment. In any case, <I><FONT color=brown>propose</FONT></I> implies at least temporary advocacy of an idea, whereas present suggests a much greater tentativeness still: indeed, a debater may <I><FONT color=brown>present</FONT></I> an argument only to refute it.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Present</FONT></I> also has applications comparable to offer that range outside the context of discussion. Both suggest humility in certain courteous phrases: <I><FONT color=brown>offer</FONT></I> my condolences; <I><FONT color=brown>present</FONT></I> my apologies. Both may indicate bringing something forward for display or appreciation: the same producer who <I><FONT color=brown>offered</FONT></I> you last year’s greatest box-office success; <I><FONT color=brown>presenting</FONT></I> four new productions during the arts festival. Both words, here, suggest generosity, but if the public must pay admission to see what is displayed, these words can become unpleasantly self-congratulatory and euphemistic.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Proffer</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tender</FONT></B>, now going out of fashion, were once used to suggest something <I><FONT color=brown>proposed</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>offered</FONT></I> in a humble, deferential way. They still are used in some extremely formal phrases: <I><FONT color=brown>proffer</FONT></I> my regrets; <I><FONT color=brown>tender</FONT></I> my resignation. Their use in other situations might now seem affected or coy ?except when <I><FONT color=brown>tender</FONT></I> is used in the commercial sense of bidding competitively. [The firm decided not to <I><FONT color=brown>tender</FONT></I> for the construction of the new bridge.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Tell">TELL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Forswear">FORSWEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Reject">REJECT</A>, withhold.</P>

<P>These words refer to anything the times have passed by because of its age, inefficiency or displacement by something superior, or because of changing tastes. <B><FONT color=blue>Old-fashioned</FONT></B> suggests that something has gone out of use because of an arbitrary change of custom: <I><FONT color=brown>old-fashioned</FONT></I> thick stockings for women. The word can also suggest a change in technology rather than in taste: <I><FONT color=brown>old-fashioned</FONT></I> 78 rpm records. But it does not necessarily imply that the outmoded or superseded thing in question no longer exists physically: the <I><FONT color=brown>old-fashioned</FONT></I> wedding dress she had treasured for 20 years. Sometimes the word can nostalgically describe something valued for its quaintness, its formality or its wholesome simplicity: the current rage for <I><FONT color=brown>old-fashioned</FONT></I> coach and ship lamps; an <I><FONT color=brown>old-fashioned</FONT></I> wedding with all the trimmings; plain, <I><FONT color=brown>old-fashioned</FONT></I> home cooking.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Out-of-date</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>passé</FONT></B> share with <I><FONT color=brown>old-fashioned</FONT></I> an emphasis on an arbitrary change of taste and style. <I><FONT color=brown>Out-of-date</FONT></I> is descriptive and neutral and may refer to a lack of factual validity as well as to a change of taste; <I><FONT color=brown>passé</FONT></I> carries a tinge of contempt for something no longer in vogue statistics that rapidly become <I><FONT color=brown>out-of-date</FONT></I>; full of <I><FONT color=brown>passé</FONT></I> notions about which hair styles are chic and sophisticated.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Antediluvian</FONT></B>, meaning literally before the Flood, is a hyperbole for ideas more neutrally expressed by <B><FONT color=blue>antiquated</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>archaic</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Antiquated</FONT></I> suggests the continued existence of something very old and now functioning badly, if not also superseded long ago by a more efficient or useful arrangement: an <I><FONT color=brown>antiquated</FONT></I>, treadle-operated sewing machine. <I><FONT color=brown>Archaic</FONT></I> may also suggest something old but still surviving; in this sense, it implies a given period in the past and can be used solely to classify rather than to evaluate: the <I><FONT color=brown>archaic</FONT></I> dress of the Amish Mennonites; a statue carved in the <I><FONT color=brown>archaic</FONT></I> manner. In other senses, <I><FONT color=brown>archaic</FONT></I> refers to something extremely old and not now in general use; in this case it can be a more formal or technical substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>old-fashioned</FONT></I>: many <I><FONT color=brown>archaic</FONT></I> declensions that were abandoned during the development of the language. The hyperbolic <I><FONT color=brown>antediluvian</FONT></I> is mostly used humorously for any of these meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>antiquated</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>archaic</FONT></I>, with the added suggestion, when it pertains to ideas, of an extremely conservative or reactionary temper: an economic policy as <I><FONT color=brown>antediluvian</FONT></I> as a troglodyte.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Obsolete</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>obsolescent</FONT></B> refer to different moments in the same process. <I><FONT color=brown>Obsolete</FONT></I> indicates what has already passed totally from use or adherence or what has been completely superseded; <I><FONT color=brown>obsolescent</FONT></I> points to what is now passing away: The death penalty for theft has long been <I><FONT color=brown>obsolete</FONT></I>, but for graver crimes it is only now becoming <I><FONT color=brown>obsolescent</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Obsolescent</FONT></I> has a special reference, as well, to arbitrary modifications of a product that are deliberately introduced not to increase its usefulness but to make earlier models seem <I><FONT color=brown>passé</FONT></I>: Motor-cars, like women’s clothes, are now designed to become <I><FONT color=brown>obsolescent</FONT></I> in a single year.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Obsolete</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>obsolescent</FONT></I> and archaic are all applied to words that are now seldom or never used. An <I><FONT color=brown>obsolete</FONT></I> word is no longer used either in speech or writing, usually because it has been supplanted by a different word. "Oscitate," meaning to yawn, is now <I><FONT color=brown>obsolete</FONT></I>. An <I><FONT color=brown>obsolescent</FONT></I> word, though still in use, is becoming <I><FONT color=brown>obsolete</FONT></I>. Much modern slang rapidly becomes <I><FONT color=brown>obsolescent</FONT></I>. Archaic words were current at some time in the past, and appear in literature and in the Bible; unlike <I><FONT color=brown>obsolete</FONT></I> words they are still used, either for effect, because they have an unmistakable flavour of their period or milieu, or else by persons whose vocabularies were formed in a distinctively earlier era. The word "methinks" and the phrase "I trow" are <I><FONT color=brown>archaic</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>SEE</FONT></B>: <A href="entry://Ancient">ANCIENT</A>, <A href="entry://Unusual">UNUSUAL</A>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>ANTONYMS</FONT></B>: à la mode, avant-garde, <A href="entry://Modern">MODERN</A>, <A href="entry://Stylish">STYLISH</A>, UP-TO-DATE.</P>

<P>These words all denote an empty space or a hole in something. <B><FONT color=blue>Opening</FONT></B>, the most general, refers to any vacant or unobstructed space, as hole or passage. It can be substituted for each of the other words here considered in many contexts: an <I><FONT color=brown>opening</FONT></I> cut in a fence for passers-by to watch the construction going on in an excavation; an <I><FONT color=brown>opening</FONT></I> in the ground serving as a sump. An <I><FONT color=brown>opening</FONT></I> in a forest is a tract where few or no trees grow. Thus an <I><FONT color=brown>opening</FONT></I> may be either natural or contrived. <B><FONT color=blue>Gap</FONT></B> usually applies to a wide crack and suggests a deviation from the normal or regular conformation: a <I><FONT color=brown>gap</FONT></I> between two teeth; a large <I><FONT color=brown>gap</FONT></I> in the wall of the bombed building. <I><FONT color=brown>Gap</FONT></I> is also used abstractly, indicating a break in continuity: a <I><FONT color=brown>gap</FONT></I> in one’s memory. It is also a narrow, steep space or defile between two cliffs or hills: The ship passed through the <I><FONT color=brown>gap</FONT></I> between the heads; cattle driven through the <I><FONT color=brown>gap</FONT></I> into the grassy valley.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Aperture</FONT></B> is a more formal word than <I><FONT color=brown>opening</FONT></I>, and applies to any opening or cleft in a surface, regardless of the nature of the cause: windows regarded as <I><FONT color=brown>apertures</FONT></I> in walls; <I><FONT color=brown>apertures</FONT></I> in the leaves of a diseased tree. The <I><FONT color=brown>aperture</FONT></I> of a camera is an <I><FONT color=brown>opening</FONT></I>, often adjustable in diameter, through which light enters the lens. <B><FONT color=blue>Orifice</FONT></B>, which is derived from the Latin word for mouth, refers to an <I><FONT color=brown>aperture</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>opening</FONT></I> into a cavity or enclosed place, and therefore suggests a point of access or entry: the <I><FONT color=brown>orifice</FONT></I> of a chimney; the <I><FONT color=brown>orifice</FONT></I> of a test tube; Smoke belched from the <I><FONT color=brown>orifice</FONT></I> of the volcano. <I><FONT color=brown>Orifice</FONT></I> is much used in medical contexts in reference to <I><FONT color=brown>openings</FONT></I> into body cavities. The pulmonary <I><FONT color=brown>orifice</FONT></I>, for example, is the <I><FONT color=brown>opening</FONT></I> of the pulmonary artery into the heart. <B><FONT color=blue>Interstice</FONT></B> is a very formal word suitable only in contexts where preciseness of description is necessary. It refers to one of a series of narrow spaces or <I><FONT color=brown>openings</FONT></I> between adjoining things or parts. [The <I><FONT color=brown>interstices</FONT></I> of a sweater knitted with thick wool are comparatively large; If the <I><FONT color=brown>interstices</FONT></I> in a fisherman’s net are too large, too many fish will escape through the meshes.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Crack">CRACK</A>, <A href="entry://Cut">CUT</A>, <A href="entry://Hole">HOLE</A>, <A href="entry://Leak">LEAK</A>, <A href="entry://Vacant">VACANT</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>opinion</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>belief</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>conviction</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>estimate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>impression</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sentiment</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>view</FONT></B>:

<P>These words designate thoughts or feelings about a subject. <B><FONT color=blue>Opinion</FONT></B> ranges from purely personal prejudice to relatively authoritative judgement. At both extremes it implies a prior formulation of ideas or conclusions regarding a matter in dispute or under consideration. At its most individual, it involves evaluation, indicating an expression of personal thought, feeling, preference or taste. [What is your <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I> of the latest styles?] In a more conclusive sense, it may represent an expert judgement in a matter of objective fact or truth. [In the <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I> of my doctors, I should be well enough to travel by next week.] In all cases, however, <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I> is carefully distinguished from fact. An <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I> may be held with confidence, but it still falls short of positive knowledge and is open to challenge. [She sought the <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I> of several experts, but even the experts disagree.] In a broader frame of reference, <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I> may indicate prevailing ideas that many people hold in common: public <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I>. At its most definite, it designates the formal announcement of the conclusions of a court: the majority <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I> of the Supreme Court, citing precedents and constitutional principles in support of a decision.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sentiment</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>view</FONT></B> relate to personal <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I>, and both frequently appear in the plural. <I><FONT color=brown>Sentiment</FONT></I> stresses feeling rather than reason, often indicating an idealistic approach or emotional stand rather than a pragmatic one. The word is now encountered only in certain contexts. [His Anzac Day speech was full of patriotic <I><FONT color=brown>sentiments</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>sentiment</FONT></I> expressed on a birthday card; A clever barrister will try to assess the <I><FONT color=brown>sentiments</FONT></I> of a jury before launching his defence; I agree with you ?those are my <I><FONT color=brown>sentiments</FONT></I> exactly.] <B><FONT color=blue>View</FONT></B> stresses the personal element, emphasizing an individual attitude, approach or point of focus. [In my <I><FONT color=brown>view</FONT></I>, the scheme seems unworkable; an article setting forth the member’s <I><FONT color=brown>view</FONT></I> on Vietnam and the proposed tax increase; a naturalistic novelist’s <I><FONT color=brown>view</FONT></I> of society.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Impression</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>estimate</FONT></B> stress the element of uncertainty in venturing an opinion. An <I><FONT color=brown>impression</FONT></I> arises from external factors, whether it leaves its mark on the senses or the mind. The word may indicate the first reaction of the mind, before the due consideration that warrants an <I><FONT color=brown>opinion</FONT></I>, and may imply a superficial view or conclusion: the danger of judging on the basis of first <I><FONT color=brown>impressions</FONT></I>. In other cases, <I><FONT color=brown>impression</FONT></I> may emphasize vagueness of recollection, or caution and uncertainty in stating a view: [My <I><FONT color=brown>impression</FONT></I> is that she was lying, but I couldn’t swear to it; He had the <I><FONT color=brown>impression</FONT></I> that they had met before.] Unlike an <I><FONT color=brown>impression</FONT></I>, an <I><FONT color=brown>estimate</FONT></I> does not reflect an uncertain memory or mind; instead, it involves a personal appraisal or a value judgement. An <I><FONT color=brown>estimate</FONT></I> is based on the pertinent facts available at the time, the implication being that other, unknown factors might enter at a later stage. [The final cost was considerably higher than the builder’s original <I><FONT color=brown>estimate</FONT></I>.] An <I><FONT color=brown>estimate</FONT></I> also involves a consideration of the different aspects of a thing, or a weighing of pros and cons, with the attendant possibility of error in judgement. [After reviewing his first batch of work, what is your <I><FONT color=brown>estimate</FONT></I> of his ability?; a critical <I><FONT color=brown>estimate</FONT></I> of Morris West.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Belief</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>conviction</FONT></B> are examples of positive opinion. A <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> is something accepted by the mind as being true without certain proof. It may either originate in the mind or be instilled in the mind by others: a child’s <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> that monsters lurk in the dark; a boy’s <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> in Father Christmas. <I><FONT color=brown>Belief</FONT></I> has a wide range of application, embracing ideas, theories, philosophies, religious creeds or tenets, superstitions: a <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> that men are basically good; the Christian <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> that Jesus was the Son of God; the <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> that Friday the 13<SUP>th</SUP> is unlucky. <I><FONT color=brown>Belief</FONT></I>, itself, may range from simply, unquestioning acceptance to deep emotional involvement: <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> in a news report; <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> in a friend’s innocence. Sometimes, however, it may convey a lingering uncertainty. [It’s my <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> that she'll succeed, but only time will tell.] A <I><FONT color=brown>conviction</FONT></I> is a strong <I><FONT color=brown>belief</FONT></I> arising from a deep-seated feeling of certainty. The word often implies the overcoming of previous doubt or scepticism. [Captain James Cook’s <I><FONT color=brown>conviction</FONT></I> that appropriate diet would prevent scurvy; to have the courage of one’s <I><FONT color=brown>convictions</FONT></I>.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Believable">BELIEVABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Emotion">EMOTION</A>, <A href="entry://Idea">IDEA</A>, <A href="entry://Suppose">SUPPOSE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all designate a person or thing that opposes or is hostile to another person or thing. <B><FONT color=blue>Opponent</FONT></B>, the most general term in the group, designates a person engaged in some kind of disagreement, competition, opposition or conflict. Because of the wide range or uses for this word, it cannot be said by definition that an <I><FONT color=brown>opponent</FONT></I> is hostile or not hostile; only the context in question can determine this qualification. [The two men had become fast friends when they were <I><FONT color=brown>opponents</FONT></I> in a chess tournament; <I><FONT color=brown>Opponents</FONT></I> of the proposed liquor legislation were defeated in a bitter fight on the floor of the House.] <B><FONT color=blue>Antagonist</FONT></B>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>opponent</FONT></I>, can refer to an impersonal agent: Science and superstition are eternal <I><FONT color=brown>antagonists</FONT></I>. When applied to a person, <I><FONT color=brown>antagonist</FONT></I> suggests more hostility or sharper opposition than opponent does: His political <I><FONT color=brown>antagonist</FONT></I> was determined to use every possible means to defeat the sitting member’s bid for re-election. <B><FONT color=blue>Adversary</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>opponent</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>antagonist</FONT></I>, is a general word with a wide range of application. [The Crown prosecutor has a kind of intuition which makes him a formidable courtroom <I><FONT color=brown>adversary</FONT></I>; The all Blacks and the Wallabies are worthy <I><FONT color=brown>adversaries</FONT></I> on the football field.] But usually <I><FONT color=brown>adversary</FONT></I> suggests a person or side that not only opposes another in fact, but does so with hostility or malignity: The two countries were ancient <I><FONT color=brown>adversaries</FONT></I> and had met more than once on the field of battle.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rival</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>competitor</FONT></B> both denote a person who seeks the same object or end for which another is striving; but, whereas the <I><FONT color=brown>competitor</FONT></I> may be impersonal and contend with no hostility, the <I><FONT color=brown>rival</FONT></I> is usually motivated by personal feelings that can make him inimical or malicious. [The small shop owner often welcomes a nearby <I><FONT color=brown>competitor</FONT></I> to stimulate business; the two men were not only <I><FONT color=brown>rivals</FONT></I> for the same job but also for the same girl, a situation which caused an extreme amount of ill will between them.]</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>enemy</FONT></B> is most often a person who is moved by feelings of animosity to an attempt to harm or destroy: Because of an old family feud, the two cousins were <I><FONT color=brown>enemies</FONT></I> from birth. But the word can suggest opposition without hostility, or merely a simple feeling of dislike. [Smog is the <I><FONT color=brown>enemy</FONT></I> of healthy lungs; She seems to have more <I><FONT color=brown>enemies</FONT></I> than friends.] In military language, all who fight on the opposite side are referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>enemies</FONT></I>, or, collectively, as "the enemy." No personal animosity is implicit when the word is used in such contexts; individual ill feeling may or may not exist. <B><FONT color=blue>Foe</FONT></B> is very much like <I><FONT color=brown>enemy</FONT></I> in definition, but it is distinctly more poetical or literary in tone. It suggests a hostile spirit and purpose in all contexts except the most impersonal. [Britain and Germany were bitter <I><FONT color=brown>foes</FONT></I> in two world wars; Ignorance is a <I><FONT color=brown>foe</FONT></I> of progress.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compete">COMPETE</A>, <A href="entry://Enmity">ENMITY</A>, <A href="entry://Opposed">OPPOSED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Associate">ASSOCIATE</A>, <A href="entry://Friend">FRIEND</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to easy, timely, fortunate or practical actions that promote self-interest and the hope of gain or advancement. <B><FONT color=blue>Opportune</FONT></B> has the widest range of application. It may suggest chance action that gives unexpectedly good results: an <I><FONT color=brown>opportune</FONT></I> change of plans that placed them far from the area where the disaster occurred; an accidental encounter that proved to be <I><FONT color=brown>opportune</FONT></I>. More commonly the word suggests a conscious choice with an eye to suitability or timing: an <I><FONT color=brown>opportune</FONT></I> moment to oppose the Prime Minister. Often the word suggests action that is taken to ingratiate or advance oneself; a note of insincerity may sometimes be present: making <I><FONT color=brown>opportune</FONT></I> remarks that he knew would flatter the prejudices of his superior.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Advantageous</FONT></B> lays its stress on favourable results; these may be arrived at by chance or design, but the word in any case often suggests a self-interested rather than altruistic attitude: happening on the most <I><FONT color=brown>advantageous</FONT></I> spot for viewing the sunset; seeking out the most <I><FONT color=brown>advantageous</FONT></I> positions from which to attack the enemy; driving the most <I><FONT color=brown>advantageous</FONT></I> bargain possible; lobbying for legislation that would be <I><FONT color=brown>advantageous</FONT></I> to his backers. <B><FONT color=blue>Convenient</FONT></B> suggests considerations of ease and comfort: a flat <I><FONT color=brown>convenient</FONT></I> to the city bus route. The word is often used to imply that these considerations have outweighed such ethical concerns as truth or fairness: telling <I><FONT color=brown>convenient</FONT></I> lies, careless of whom she hurt; <I><FONT color=brown>convenient</FONT></I> excuses; <I><FONT color=brown>convenient</FONT></I> compromises that would offend no one but accomplish nothing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Expedient</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>politic</FONT></B> refer much more strongly to narrow self-interest. Most neutrally, <I><FONT color=brown>expedient</FONT></I> can indicate an improvised or temporary solution taken out of necessity: an <I><FONT color=brown>expedient</FONT></I> repair job that would at least get them to the next town. The conflict between self-interest and ethics is amply apparent in most other uses: appealing to the country’s immigrant population as a purely <I><FONT color=brown>expedient</FONT></I> political gesture; twisting the facts outrageously whenever he thought it <I><FONT color=brown>expedient</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Politic</FONT></I> is milder than <I><FONT color=brown>expedient</FONT></I>, suggesting actions governed more by immediate practical considerations than by any larger view: those who think it <I><FONT color=brown>politic</FONT></I> never to disagree with their employers. The word certainly suggests insincerity and the currying of favour, if not the disregard of ethics possible for <I><FONT color=brown>expedient</FONT></I>: another excruciating attempt to be politic about his mother-in-law’s view on current affairs.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Beneficial">BENEFICIAL</A>, <A href="entry://Chance">CHANCE</A>, <A href="entry://Favourable">FAVOURABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Opportunistic">OPPORTUNISTIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: disadvantageous, idealistic, inconvenient, inexpedient, inopportune, unseasonable, untimely.</P>

opportunistic
<B><FONT color=blue>opportunistic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ambitious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>aspiring</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pushy</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are comparable in that they all refer to people who desire or are actively striving towards the attainment of some goal. <B><FONT color=blue>Opportunistic</FONT></B> is used to describe a person who takes advantage of every opportunity presented to him that contributes to the achievement of his end, and who is relatively uninfluenced by moral principles or sentiment: an <I><FONT color=brown>opportunistic</FONT></I> young man who rose from office boy to office manager by callously using everyone who could further his career. <B><FONT color=blue>Ambitious</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>opportunistic</FONT></I>, is applied to someone who purposefully utilizes opportunities but, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>opportunistic</FONT></I>, this word need not always have pejorative connotations. <I><FONT color=brown>Ambitious</FONT></I> people may or may not be principled. What they must always be is eager and active in the pursuit of the wealth, power, honours or whatever else they have chosen as their goal: a very talented singer who was not <I><FONT color=brown>ambitious</FONT></I> might at times be described by the more informal and almost always derogatory term <B><FONT color=blue>pushy</FONT></B>. In its application to different people pushy may suggest offensiveness, bossiness or crudeness: a <I><FONT color=brown>pushy</FONT></I> social climber; a <I><FONT color=brown>pushy</FONT></I> advertising cadet.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Aspiring</FONT></B> is a milder and more neutral word than the others in this group. It does not necessarily have the suggestions of drive and energy that are implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>opportunistic</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>ambitious</FONT></I>, and it is certainly devoid of the pejorative connotations in <I><FONT color=brown>pushy</FONT></I>. An <I><FONT color=brown>aspiring</FONT></I> person seeks something above himself, as excellence for its won sake, and the word usually implies lofty ideals: an <I><FONT color=brown>aspiring</FONT></I> politician who refused to compromise his principles in return for favours from party hacks.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bold">BOLD</A>, <A href="entry://Opportune">OPPORTUNE</A>, <A href="entry://Reckless">RECKLESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: indolent, lazy, <A href="entry://Timid">TIMID</A>, <A href="entry://Uninvolved">UNINVOLVED</A>.</P>

optimistic
<B><FONT color=blue>optimistic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>confident</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hopeful</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sanguine</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to positive frames of mind. An <B><FONT color=blue>optimistic</FONT></B> person is one who cheerfully expects things to work out all right in the future. This attitude may be well-grounded in fact or may merely represent a determined attempt to "look on the bright side of things" regardless of the evidence: unofficial polls that made him <I><FONT color=brown>optimistic</FONT></I> about the election’s outcome; still <I><FONT color=brown>optimistic</FONT></I> that they would be sighted, after more than a week adrift. The <I><FONT color=brown>optimistic</FONT></I> attitude may, in fact, be grounded in a fear of facing actualities, or in blind faith.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sanguine</FONT></B> emphasizes almost exclusively a habitual frame of mind that anticipates good fortune. The word can sometimes suggest an unfounded <I><FONT color=brown>optimistic</FONT></I> view that flies in the face of fact: so <I><FONT color=brown>sanguine</FONT></I> about the future that he didn’t bother to do the work necessary to realizing his goal. The word is more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>optimistic</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hopeful</FONT></B> is not so strong as the foregoing words; a <I><FONT color=brown>hopeful</FONT></I> person may desire a specific outcome without being certain that it will come about as he hopes: still <I><FONT color=brown>hopeful</FONT></I> that some kind of miracle would occur, long after her <I><FONT color=brown>optimistic</FONT></I> mood had left her. <B><FONT color=blue>Confident</FONT></B>, by contrast, stresses conviction and certainty about the future; the word, furthermore, may imply a conviction based on a knowledge of the facts: first-quarter sales figures that made him <I><FONT color=brown>confident</FONT></I> his business venture would succeed. The word may also suggest self-assurance: a man who walked with a <I><FONT color=brown>confident</FONT></I> bearing.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheerful">CHEERFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Confidence">CONFIDENCE</A>, <A href="entry://Favourable">FAVOURABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Happiness">HAPPINESS</A>, <A href="entry://Joyous">JOYOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: cynical, defeatist, pessimistic.</P>

<P>These words refer to musical groupings composed of varying numbers of instrumentalists. Of all these words, <B><FONT color=blue>orchestra</FONT></B> can indicate the largest group of musicians; in reference to classical music, it suggests the full-scale symphonic group with its complement of strings, woodwinds, brass and percussion. While such an <I><FONT color=brown>orchestra</FONT></I> might typically have as many as a hundred players, the word itself can be qualified to suggest a smaller group: a chamber <I><FONT color=brown>orchestra</FONT></I> of twelve musicians. The one strict difference between an <I><FONT color=brown>orchestra</FONT></I> and a <B><FONT color=blue>band</FONT></B> does not pertain to size but rather to the fact that an <I><FONT color=brown>orchestra</FONT></I> has a string section and a band does not. While a variety of music exists for performance by a <I><FONT color=brown>band</FONT></I>, the word usually suggests light or popular music: rousing marches played by the military <I><FONT color=brown>band</FONT></I>. When the reference of both words is to popular or jazz music, performed for listening or dancing, the implications of both words change. In this case, <I><FONT color=brown>orchestra</FONT></I> can refer to a group of any size: a nightclub <I><FONT color=brown>orchestra</FONT></I>; a six-piece <I><FONT color=brown>orchestra</FONT></I>. This word is often used to give status to what is in fact a popular dance or jazz <I><FONT color=brown>band</FONT></I>, whether or not it has a complement of strings. Both words here might, most typically, refer to groups having something like twenty or fewer players.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ensemble</FONT></B> is the least specific of these words as to the nature and size of the group of players. Technically, two or more players can make an <I><FONT color=brown>ensemble</FONT></I>, but the word usually suggests a grouping of several players, both in classical and popular music: a chamber <I><FONT color=brown>ensemble</FONT></I>; a Dixieland <I><FONT color=brown>ensemble</FONT></I>. Since the word can refer to any group acting together in concert, it can also apply to vocal groups as well as instruments: a choral <I><FONT color=brown>ensemble</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Combo</FONT></B> is the more informal word for a group of several jazz or popular instrumentalists: a cocktail <I><FONT color=brown>combo</FONT></I>; a bop <I><FONT color=brown>combo</FONT></I>; a rock ‘n’roll <I><FONT color=brown>combo</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Quartet</FONT></B>, of course, is specific in indicating four musicians; otherwise it is completely open to qualification by context: a string <I><FONT color=brown>quartet</FONT></I>; a woodwind <I><FONT color=brown>quartet</FONT></I>; a campfire <I><FONT color=brown>quartet</FONT></I>; a rock <I><FONT color=brown>quartet</FONT></I>.

<P>These words refer to imposing a shape upon a mass of details in accordance with some plan or system. <B><FONT color=blue>Organize</FONT></B> indicates the most thoroughgoing shaping of materials of any of these words, since it can point to the achieving of either sequential or spatial form, or both. [He <I><FONT color=brown>organized</FONT></I> his speech so that his most telling points came last; The architect <I><FONT color=brown>organized</FONT></I> the shopping arcades round a central plaza.] In any case, while the word can imply the moving about of given items, it more often goes beyond this to suggest an altering of each and the fusing or fitting of part to part to form a new self-contained unity. A common use applies to the shaping of work systems: a business <I><FONT color=brown>organized</FONT></I> into two separate but interlocking companies; an administrator good at <I><FONT color=brown>organizing</FONT></I> new government programmes from scratch; a union drive to <I><FONT color=brown>organize</FONT></I> unaffiliated workers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Arrange</FONT></B> most often indicates the placing of items according to a plan, but without necessarily altering the items themselves: the job of <I><FONT color=brown>arranging</FONT></I> his vast library by subject and author. While the word stresses sequence, a more complex spatial arrangement may be indicated: the painter’s genius at <I><FONT color=brown>arranging</FONT></I> the graphic elements of his work within an overall design. A greater re-shaping of details is also suggested when the word refers to the creation of music to accompany a melody or singer: the composer who <I><FONT color=brown>arranged</FONT></I> her songs for voice and orchestra. <B><FONT color=blue>Order</FONT></B> can point to a thoroughgoing shaping and re-shaping of elements, like <I><FONT color=brown>organize</FONT></I>, but the word in this context is more formal and can be confused with its more common use referring to the requisition of something: catalogues for <I><FONT color=brown>ordering</FONT></I> spare parts. Nevertheless, the word can function, especially in an aesthetic context, to refer to one aspect of the creative process: his ability to <I><FONT color=brown>order</FONT></I> the most disparate facets of contemporary life into a harmonious whole.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Classify</FONT></B> refers to a categorizing process that at its most mechanical stands in sharp contrast to the creative acts that organize and order suggest. <I><FONT color=brown>Classify</FONT></I> can, however, sometimes refer to the creating of the categories themselves: Linnaeus’s obsolete binomial system for <I><FONT color=brown>classifying</FONT></I> animal and plant life. At its mildest, the word can indicate the identifying of examples according to existing types, possibly with no actual arranging or re-arranging whatsoever: a walk on which he noted and <I><FONT color=brown>classified</FONT></I> every tree he came across. <B><FONT color=blue>Sort</FONT></B> suggests the selection of items according to type; this process is closely related to the categorizing process indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>classify</FONT></I>. Often <I><FONT color=brown>classify</FONT></I> indicates a previous evaluative judgement and sort the disposing of items according to this evaluation: He <I><FONT color=brown>sorted</FONT></I> out the books he had earlier <I><FONT color=brown>classified</FONT></I> as worth saving. <B><FONT color=blue>Marshal</FONT></B>, the most specific of these words, serves as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>arrange</FONT></I>. In this case, items are brought together and <I><FONT color=brown>ordered</FONT></I> for greatest efficiency or for the most forceful effect possible: She <I><FONT color=brown>marshalled</FONT></I> example after example of job discrimination in her decisive statement before the Arbitration Court. At its most literal, the word refers to the manoeuvring of troops to greatest military advantage: an order to <I><FONT color=brown>marshal</FONT></I> troops on both sides of the mountain pass.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Choose">CHOOSE</A>, <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Form">FORM</A>, <A href="entry://Artistic">HARMONIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Label">LABEL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bungle, dishevel, disorganize, muddle.</P>

<P>These words refer to the antecedent, beginning, initiator or motivating principle of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Origin</FONT></B> suggests a beginning of something in time or place, or something out of which another thing arises: the <I><FONT color=brown>origin</FONT></I> of the contract theory of government in the Middle Ages; the <I><FONT color=brown>origin</FONT></I> of the Nile; the birth trauma as the <I><FONT color=brown>origin</FONT></I> of fear and anxiety.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cause</FONT></B> exclusively involves time, but the span of time need not be so long as that implied by <I><FONT color=brown>origin</FONT></I>: Friction is the <I><FONT color=brown>cause</FONT></I> of the match lighting: it also refers specifically to the notion of one thing arising out of another, rather than merely to the notion of beginning.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Basis</FONT></B> may refer to a causal relation in time but more generally it suggests a principle that underlies some actuality: respect for law as the <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I> for a peaceful society.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Root</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>source</FONT></B> involve metaphorical comparisons to a tree or a river. <I><FONT color=brown>Root</FONT></I> is most like <I><FONT color=brown>basis</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>source</FONT></I> most like <I><FONT color=brown>origin</FONT></I>: poor schooling that is at the <I><FONT color=brown>root</FONT></I> of the unemployment problem; Greek civilization as the <I><FONT color=brown>source</FONT></I> of our democratic ideals.

<P>These words refer to lavish, detailed or colourful additions to something that make it seem attractive, pleasant or festive. <B><FONT color=blue>Ornament</FONT></B> indicates the addition of detail that makes something more picturesque: the birdbath that <I><FONT color=brown>ornamented</FONT></I> the lawn. The word is more common as a noun, referring in this case to possibly gaudier details: <I><FONT color=brown>ornaments</FONT></I> for our Christmas tree. <B><FONT color=blue>Decorate</FONT></B> is more widely used than <I><FONT color=brown>ornament</FONT></I>, applying especially to places or things: They <I><FONT color=brown>decorated</FONT></I> the bandstand with red, white, and blue bunting. Where <I><FONT color=brown>ornament</FONT></I> can sometimes suggest the addition of one or few details, <I><FONT color=brown>decorate</FONT></I> often suggests a more thoroughgoing approach which affects the whole area in question: a wall <I><FONT color=brown>decorated</FONT></I> in stripes of blue and green enamel. <B><FONT color=blue>Trim</FONT></B> is more informal than the previous pair. In the specific context of Christmas tree <I><FONT color=brown>decorations</FONT></I>, it can refer to everything that is added to the tree: the <I><FONT color=brown>ornaments</FONT></I>, lights, and tinsel used to <I><FONT color=brown>trim</FONT></I> the tree. In other situations, it can often refer to colour or design applied to <I><FONT color=brown>decorate</FONT></I> the edges or accent points of something: a white house <I><FONT color=brown>trimmed</FONT></I> with green.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Embellish</FONT></B> indicates the adding of flourishes or accept points, like trim, rather than the treatment of an extensive area, like <I><FONT color=brown>decorate</FONT></I>. The special implication of <I><FONT color=brown>embellish</FONT></I>, is that such flourishes are the expressions of the decorator’s zest or are taken gratefully by others as making a material livelier or more interesting. Also, the flourish may be part of the material itself rather than an extraneous addition to it. [The painting was <I><FONT color=brown>embellished</FONT></I> with strokes of vibrant colour; a speech <I><FONT color=brown>embellished</FONT></I> with amusing anecdotes.] Sometimes, the word can refer to the elaboration rather than to the decoration of something: the wealth of detail with which the novelist <I><FONT color=brown>embellished</FONT></I> a basically simple plot. <I><FONT color=brown>Embellish</FONT></I> can also suggest partial falsification or outright dishonesty: <I><FONT color=brown>embellishing</FONT></I> his dull life with fictitious adventure; He didn’t lie so much as <I><FONT color=brown>embellish</FONT></I> the truth a little. Both <I><FONT color=brown>ornament</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>embellish</FONT></I> can also refer to musical flourishes (such as grace notes or trills, also collectively called <I><FONT color=brown>ornaments</FONT></I>, ornamentation or embellishments): Baroque composers often expected the performer to <I><FONT color=brown>ornament</FONT></I> the melodic line as he sang or played. <B><FONT color=blue>Garnish</FONT></B> is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>embellish</FONT></I> in indicating the inclusion of accent points to make something more lively or appealing, and is now most often applied to foods: an omelet <I><FONT color=brown>garnished</FONT></I> with parsley.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Adorn</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>beautify</FONT></B> both often apply to substantial external changes that are made to give something a more pleasing appearance. <I><FONT color=brown>Adorn</FONT></I> can also apply to the adding of accents, but more often it suggests the clothing or dressing up of something in attractive materials: women <I><FONT color=brown>adorned</FONT></I> in jewels and furs. <I><FONT color=brown>Beautify</FONT></I> can sometimes refer specifically to the application of make-up, but it can also apply very generally to any attempt to make something more attractive: mascara to <I><FONT color=brown>beautify</FONT></I> the eyes; a programme to <I><FONT color=brown>beautify</FONT></I> the nation’s highways. <I><FONT color=brown>Beautify</FONT></I> can also indicate <I><FONT color=brown>decorating</FONT></I> something in a garish or heavy-handed way: motels <I><FONT color=brown>beautified</FONT></I> with chrome and neon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deck</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bedeck</FONT></B> can sound old-fashioned in reference to the adding of festive trimming or layers to something, though they survive in songs and poems: <I><FONT color=brown>Deck</FONT></I> the halls with boughs of holly; a garden <I><FONT color=brown>bedecked</FONT></I> with rosemary. Both can be effective as irony: a yokel whose hair was <I><FONT color=brown>bedecked</FONT></I> with hay; a dandy <I><FONT color=brown>decked</FONT></I> out in his nattiest togs.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Elegant">ELEGANT</A>, <A href="entry://Gaudy">GAUDY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Disfigure">DISFIGURE</A>, mar.</P>

outrage
<B><FONT color=blue>outrage</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>aggravate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bug</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>exasperate</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to being annoyed, disturbed or incensed by or at something. <B><FONT color=blue>Outrage</FONT></B> points to the most intense or extreme response indicated by any of these words, but it may suggest the least direct emotional involvement in that one may be merely an onlooker rather than a participant or victim: <I><FONT color=brown>outraged</FONT></I> by the international outcry against our proposal. Thus the word can suggest attitudes of moral disapproval, prudery or haughty indignation at some displeasing display. Even where the word applies to one’s response to the actions of other, though seldom to what is done to oneself: <I><FONT color=brown>outraged</FONT></I> by his daughter’s extravagance. Occasionally, the word can suggest a more direct involvement; even here, it suggests response to behaviour or attitude rather than to physical or violent conflict: <I><FONT color=brown>outraged</FONT></I> by his repeated insults.</P><P>The formal <B><FONT color=blue>exasperate</FONT></B> and the slang word bug both introduce the personal element often lacking in outrage. <I><FONT color=brown>Exasperate</FONT></I> may suggest a final and complete breaking down of patience after repeated annoyance: so <I><FONT color=brown>exasperated</FONT></I> by his snoring that she went out and slept on the lounge. This notion of a build-up need not be present: extremely <I><FONT color=brown>exasperated</FONT></I> by the uncalled-for innuendo in the reporter’s question. In any case, the word emphasizes an angry though possibly momentary loss of calm or control: <I><FONT color=brown>exasperated</FONT></I> to the point of incoherence. <B><FONT color=blue>Bug</FONT></B> may refer as a slang or informal fad word to any displeased response to something annoying, whether the annoyance is intended as such or not: <I><FONT color=brown>bugged</FONT></I> by the garish colours in the room; <I><FONT color=brown>bugged</FONT></I> by his constant insinuating remarks about the way I dressed. The word may suggest a process of growing annoyance, some single instance of a rising gorge, or even a continuing philosophical attitude of disapproval: <I><FONT color=brown>bugged</FONT></I> by his wife’s heavy drinking month-in, month-out; an advertisement that really <I><FONT color=brown>bugged</FONT></I> me; those who are <I><FONT color=brown>bugged</FONT></I> by middle-class materialism. Also, the word can be used for a deliberate attempt to annoy someone else: trying to <I><FONT color=brown>bug</FONT></I> her about her dislike of housekeeping. The word differs in one respect from exasperate in that loss of control may or may not be implied; it can apply equally well either to a "slow-burn" reaction that never rises above passive disgruntlement or to an <I><FONT color=brown>exasperated</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>outraged</FONT></I> response.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Aggravate</FONT></B> focuses more directly on a slow process of growing annoyance, but without suggesting that emotions have reached their boiling point. In this use it is extremely informal adaptation of the word, taken over from its reference to the worsening of an already bad situation: at first <I><FONT color=brown>aggravated</FONT></I> and finally maddened by the continual crying of the sleepless infant. Often the word is used more loosely: so <I><FONT color=brown>aggravated</FONT></I> by the reprimand that he wouldn’t speak to me for days after.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Unsettle">ANNOY</A>, <A href="entry://Bother">BOTHER</A>, <A href="entry://Enrage">ENRAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Upset">UPSET</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: favour, please, <A href="entry://Satisfy">SATISFY</A>, soothe.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>outrageous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>atrocious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>monstrous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>scandalous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>shocking</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unspeakable</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to behaviour that is intolerable in immoral, or to taste that is extremely vulgar. <B><FONT color=blue>Outrageous</FONT></B> can function in any of these ways. When its reference is to morality, it suggests irredeemable depravity: an <I><FONT color=brown>outrageous</FONT></I> distortion of truth. In reference to impropriety, it suggests extreme disapproval for conscious audacity: <I><FONT color=brown>outrageous</FONT></I> manners for which he didn’t even bother to apologize. In reference to taste, it tends to be merely a vague hyperbole: her <I><FONT color=brown>outrageous</FONT></I> notion of what styles were most becoming to her. <B><FONT color=blue>Shocking</FONT></B> may apply either to an act of extreme immorality or to an unexpected or astonishing breach of manners: a <I><FONT color=brown>shocking</FONT></I> disregard for human life; his <I><FONT color=brown>shocking</FONT></I> rudeness to the elderly man. Where <I><FONT color=brown>outrageous</FONT></I> suggests an indignant response, <I><FONT color=brown>shocking</FONT></I> suggests a startled one. <I><FONT color=brown>Outrageous</FONT></I>, consequently, implies the stronger reaction of the two. Both may be used in a positive way: Tuscany’s <I><FONT color=brown>outrageous</FONT></I> loveliness; the woman’s <I><FONT color=brown>shocking</FONT></I> beauty.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scandalous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unspeakable</FONT></B> are more closely restricted to manners alone. <I><FONT color=brown>Scandalous</FONT></I> suggests a furore-creating breach of conduct; <I><FONT color=brown>unspeakable</FONT></I> suggests a violation of decency beyond the power of words to describe: their <I><FONT color=brown>scandalous</FONT></I> quarrels in full view of the neighbours; an <I><FONT color=brown>unspeakable</FONT></I> oaf. In a more prudish age, both words could actually refer euphemistically to anything thought indelicate: <I><FONT color=brown>unspeakable</FONT></I> frankness; the play’s <I><FONT color=brown>scandalous</FONT></I> suggestiveness. <I><FONT color=brown>Unspeakable</FONT></I>, however, has maintained a wider range of viable uses than <I><FONT color=brown>scandalous</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>unspeakable</FONT></I> cruelty; <I><FONT color=brown>unspeakable</FONT></I> taste.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Atrocious</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>outrageous</FONT></I>, can still refer to extremely immoral acts: such <I><FONT color=brown>atrocious</FONT></I> customs as slavery and flogging. <B><FONT color=blue>Monstrous</FONT></B>, similarly, can still describe something extremely immoral, abnormal or deformed: the <I><FONT color=brown>monstrous</FONT></I> policy of genocide. But both words have so often been used hyperbolically for anything bad or unpleasant that their original senses have been diluted: <I><FONT color=brown>atrocious</FONT></I> weather; <I><FONT color=brown>monstrous</FONT></I> luck. As hyperboles, both are commonly used to describe extremely bad manners or vulgar taste: <I><FONT color=brown>atrocious</FONT></I> rudeness; a <I><FONT color=brown>monstrous</FONT></I> style of painting.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Depraved">DEPRAVED</A>, <A href="entry://Gauche">GAUCHE</A>, <A href="entry://Gaudy">GAUDY</A>, <A href="entry://Reprehensible">REPREHENSIBLE</A>, <A href="entry://Vulgar">VULGAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: appropriate, commendable, decorous, discreet, <A href="entry://Humane">HUMANE</A>, <A href="entry://Polite">POLITE</A>, tasteful.</P>

<P>These words refer to statements that are simple, direct or forceful, or to a guileless or tactless manner. While <B><FONT color=blue>outspoken</FONT></B> applies approvingly to vigorous statements of one’s position or sentiments, it can also suggest a brusque manner or an indifference to the feelings of others. In any case, it is the strongest word here, carrying overtones of fearlessness and aggressiveness, as well: an <I><FONT color=brown>outspoken</FONT></I> critic of the automotive industry’s standards of car safety; an <I><FONT color=brown>outspoken</FONT></I> fool who blustered and stormed but never got his facts right. Used in a more general way, the word can indicate, with greater neutrality, a willingness to take a stand or express oneself: He urged the timid boy to be a little more <I><FONT color=brown>outspoken</FONT></I> about his needs and desires.</P><P>Where <I><FONT color=brown>outspoken</FONT></I> often implies criticism of others, <B><FONT color=blue>open</FONT></B> often suggests someone’s willingness to expose himself and his vulnerabilities to another person: successful marriages in which both partners are <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> with each other. The word can also refer more specifically to an unthinking or fearless lack of secrecy, particularly in its adverbial form: They carried on their affair quite <I><FONT color=brown>openly</FONT></I>, without shame or guilt. The word can also apply to whatever is widely known, or to public statements deliberately made for the record: an <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> secret; an <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> scandal; an <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> avowal of their intention to compete for the government contract. By extension, the word can indicate whatever is tantamount to a direct or public acknowledgement: She gave me a smile that was an <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> admission of her contempt for our immediate superior.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Straightforward</FONT></B> most often applies to a character trait; it indicates a lack of deviousness in the way someone deals with other people. While it suggests unflinching directness in making requests of others, it does not need to suggest either a lack of consideration, as is possible for <I><FONT color=brown>outspoken</FONT></I>, or a willingness to be exposed and vulnerable, like <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I>: a courteous but straightforward refusal to give me the facts about his past. <B><FONT color=blue>Forthright</FONT></B> is more closely related to open in suggesting either a readiness to respond to the request of others or a sincere statement that does not hedge or involve evasion: a <I><FONT color=brown>forthright</FONT></I> person, always willing to give his dissatisfaction with his own work on the town-planning project.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Plain-spoken</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>straightforward</FONT></I> in indicating directness, but adds to this implications of simple and unambiguous utterance, as well: She replied to their complex reasons and arguments with a <I><FONT color=brown>plain-spoken</FONT></I> refusal to co-operate. The word can even function more emphatically to indicate a terse or blunt statement that completely rejects circumlocutions and euphemisms: He argued that it was merely being honest and <I><FONT color=brown>plain-spoken</FONT></I> to speak about starvation where these native villagers were concerned, and not about food shortages, hunger or malnutrition.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Brusque">BRUSQUE</A>, <A href="entry://Candid">CANDID</A>, <A href="entry://Sincere">SINCERE</A>, <A href="entry://Truthful">TRUTHFUL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cautious">CAUTIOUS</A>, insincere, <A href="entry://Misleading">MISLEADING</A>, subtle, <A href="entry://Taciturn">TACITURN</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to something of unusual distinction or relevance by reason of its excellence or motivating force. <B><FONT color=blue>Outstanding</FONT></B> is the most general and least formal of these words; most appropriately, it suggests excellence: an <I><FONT color=brown>outstanding</FONT></I> scientist of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century. It may suggest a feature that is sharply distinct from its surroundings: the <I><FONT color=brown>outstanding</FONT></I> impression of squalor that the town left us with. The word may also refer to the most important of a number of causative factors: frustration as the <I><FONT color=brown>outstanding</FONT></I> cause of the prison riots. <B><FONT color=blue>Foremost</FONT></B> is considerably more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>outstanding</FONT></I>, but is otherwise similar in its uses. It more strongly suggests that the excellence, distinction or power being referred to is simply the most important of many contenders for first place: the <I><FONT color=brown>foremost</FONT></I> interpreter of Bach; the <I><FONT color=brown>foremost</FONT></I> port of the region; the <I><FONT color=brown>foremost</FONT></I> reason for the legislators?change of attitude. When referring to a person’s excellence, the word may suggest formal or official recognition and approval more than actual superiority: Kozeluch was the <I><FONT color=brown>foremost</FONT></I> composer of his day despite Mozart’s <I><FONT color=brown>outstanding</FONT></I> creative triumphs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Distinguished</FONT></B> stresses almost exclusively this last connotation of foremost, emphasizing merit that has been publicly recognized or honoured: <I><FONT color=brown>distinguished</FONT></I> composers who, unlike their obscurer colleagues, do not have to struggle to get a hearing for their music. <B><FONT color=blue>Prominent</FONT></B> carries less suggestions of excellence than foremost or <I><FONT color=brown>distinguished</FONT></I>. This word may point to status gained on other grounds entirely, or suggest merely familiarity to a wide audience: socially <I><FONT color=brown>prominent</FONT></I> families; a novel that became <I><FONT color=brown>prominent</FONT></I> merely for its sensationalism.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dominant</FONT></B> dwells mostly on causative force or a position of power: From his <I><FONT color=brown>dominant</FONT></I> position as chairman of the board, he neglected the testimony of the foremost authorities; his company, consequently, failed to make an <I><FONT color=brown>outstanding</FONT></I> contribution to the war effort. <B><FONT color=blue>Paramount</FONT></B> strictly suggests a singular superiority rather than a most important excellence out of many ?or even out of a few: lack of morale as the <I><FONT color=brown>paramount</FONT></I> cause of our defeat. In many contexts the word might be thought excessively formal. <B><FONT color=blue>Predominant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>preponderant</FONT></B>, on the other hand, imply a narrower advantage over the nearest contenders. <I><FONT color=brown>Predominant</FONT></I> suggests a recent ascendancy or points to a factor that is closely related to other, almost as important, factors; the era when religious tolerance became <I><FONT color=brown>predominant</FONT></I>; an electorate for whom the issues are the <I><FONT color=brown>predominant</FONT></I> consideration out of many extraneous factors vying for their attention. <I><FONT color=brown>Predominant</FONT></I> is less used to refer to people; in comparison to the power and control suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>dominant</FONT></I>, it suggests less clearly defined or less decisive factors: the <I><FONT color=brown>predominant</FONT></I> apathy of the people that permitted the Nazi party to gain its <I><FONT color=brown>dominant</FONT></I> position. <I><FONT color=brown>Preponderant</FONT></I> may function similarly to <I><FONT color=brown>predominant</FONT></I>, but it may specifically suggest quantity rather than ascendancy. [All kinds of trees flourish in the region, but the <I><FONT color=brown>preponderant</FONT></I> species is the elm; Caution was foremost in the minds of a <I><FONT color=brown>preponderant</FONT></I> number of voters.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Prevailing</FONT></B> is closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>predominant</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>preponderant</FONT></I> but it suggests an ascendancy that, while usual, is by no means uninterrupted or continuous: <I><FONT color=brown>prevailing</FONT></I> westerly winds. It may also suggest a consensus that is decisive but far from unanimous: the <I><FONT color=brown>prevailing</FONT></I> bipartisan foreign policy.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conclusive">CONCLUSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Famous">FAMOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Great">GREAT</A>, <A href="entry://Significant">SIGNIFICANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Mediocre">MEDIOCRE</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words are used to describe the character or actions of persons who are possessed of an exaggerated pride or who, often because of such pride, behave in an excessively determined, commanding or even tyrannical way. <B><FONT color=blue>Overbearing</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>domineering</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>imperious</FONT></B> refer to the latter group, persons in whom we can recognize a strong desire to exercise authority or at least o force their wishes on others; all three words suggest that the insistence on being dominant is based on a real or assumed superiority: an office manager who was <I><FONT color=brown>overbearing</FONT></I> in his relations with his staff; a young man who never attained any independence and initiative because he was always under the thumb of a <I><FONT color=brown>domineering</FONT></I> father, a multitude of <I><FONT color=brown>imperious</FONT></I> demands that were met with reluctance and ill will.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Arrogant</FONT></B> means unduly pound of wealth, station, learning, achievements, etc. Because of his exaggerated sense of self, the <I><FONT color=brown>arrogant</FONT></I> person takes upon himself more power or authority than is rightly his: the general’s <I><FONT color=brown>arrogant</FONT></I> seizure of the powers of state at the end of the civil war. <B><FONT color=blue>Haughty</FONT></B> is much the same as <I><FONT color=brown>arrogant</FONT></I> in denotation, but there is in the <I><FONT color=brown>haughty</FONT></I> person more feeling of pride and less compulsion to dominate than in someone who is <I><FONT color=brown>arrogant</FONT></I>. The <I><FONT color=brown>haughty</FONT></I> man thinks highly of himself while holding others in contempt, and may be rude and boorish or at least icily reserved in his treatment of those he considers to be his inferiors: a <I><FONT color=brown>haughty</FONT></I> socialite who refused to attend her daughter’s wedding because she did not approve of the groom’s parents.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conceited">CONCEITED</A>, <A href="entry://Contemptuous">CONTEMPTUOUS</A>, peremptory.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: deferential, <A href="entry://Docile">DOCILE</A>, <A href="entry://Modest">MODEST</A>, <A href="entry://Obsequious">OBSEQUIOUS</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to the action of listening-in on or prying into the private conversations or affairs of others. To <B><FONT color=blue>overhear</FONT></B> is to listen to something being said without the knowledge or intention of the speaker or speakers. <I><FONT color=brown>Overhearing</FONT></I> is the most innocent action in this group because it is accidental in nature. The only time the word suggests a lack of innocence is when we know the <I><FONT color=brown>overhearing</FONT></I> mentioned went on for so long a time that the accident turned into a design. "I couldn’t help <I><FONT color=brown>overhearing</FONT></I> what you said to so-and-so" is often a euphemistic way of saying "I caught part of your private conversation and stayed on to enjoy it." The word for which <I><FONT color=brown>overhear</FONT></I> would be the euphemism in this case is <B><FONT color=blue>eavesdrop</FONT></B>. To <I><FONT color=brown>eavesdrop</FONT></I> is to listen in secret to some kind of private exchange. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>overhearing</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>eavesdropping</FONT></I> is never unintentional. Even if one were to blunder into a situation where one overhears something private, the <I><FONT color=brown>overhearing</FONT></I> does not turn into <I><FONT color=brown>eavesdropping</FONT></I> without thought and decision: I sat in a café cubicle next tot he one where Marge and Jim were dining and before long I was <I><FONT color=brown>eavesdropping</FONT></I> on their conversation.</P><P>To <I><FONT color=brown>eavesdrop</FONT></I> by means of an electronic receiver is to <B><FONT color=blue>monitor</FONT></B>. The receiver may be planted in a telephone, in the wall of a room, in a chandelier, etc., and is designed particularly to listen-in on conversation with military, political, business or criminal significance. <I><FONT color=brown>Monitoring</FONT></I> is also the word used to designate a kind of observation or surveillance kept by a person or by a camera: Police <I><FONT color=brown>monitored</FONT></I> the suspect’s comings and goings with a camera planted in a building across the street from his home.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>bug</FONT></B> is to put a hidden listening device in a room, telephone circuit, etc. the device, which is called a <I><FONT color=brown>bug</FONT></I>, can be so small that it might be concealed as part of a person’s clothing or jewellery. Jokes and cartoons have illustrated the fact that even so harmless-looking a thing as the olive in a martini might be <I><FONT color=brown>bugged</FONT></I> to facilitate a planned invasion of privacy.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>tap</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>wiretap</FONT></B> is to cut into a telephone or telegraph circuit for the purpose of secretly intercepting conversations and messages. [All conversations having to do with the planned merger of the two companies were <I><FONT color=brown>wiretapped</FONT></I> by a competitor; She hired a private detective to <I><FONT color=brown>tap</FONT></I> her husband’s office phone in preparation for the commencement of divorce proceedings.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Snoop</FONT></B> is a general term that might be used in place of any of the words in this group except the innocent <I><FONT color=brown>overhear</FONT></I>. While <I><FONT color=brown>snooping</FONT></I> has always designated a particularly sneaky, unsavoury way to pry, its conversion from a personal to a electronic technique has given <I><FONT color=brown>snoop</FONT></I> much more sinister connotations than it ever had before.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Encroach">ENCROACH</A>, <A href="entry://Meddlesome">MEDDLESOME</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things that are made amply evident by direct expression. <B><FONT color=blue>Overt</FONT></B> indicates attitudes, feelings and behaviour that are put into words or acted upon, rather than intimated or suppressed: an <I><FONT color=brown>overt</FONT></I> declaration of his desire to marry her; an <I><FONT color=brown>overt</FONT></I> philanderer; rebellious feelings that had passed the talking stage and were about to become <I><FONT color=brown>overt</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Patent</FONT></B> stresses that something is unmistakably obvious and clear: a grasp and discrimination that is patent on every page of the book. The word frequently carries a pejorative tone: a <I><FONT color=brown>patent</FONT></I> lie; a <I><FONT color=brown>patent</FONT></I> irresponsibility.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Open</FONT></B> refers to things done in an honest or unashamed manner, indifferent to criticism or reproof: easy to be <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> if you have nothing to hid; arguing that the liquor laws were <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> invitations to drunkenness; an <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> declaration of their stand on the controversial proposal. While a person may be <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> with his friends about his beliefs, he might still not wish to make <B><FONT color=blue>public</FONT></B> either his affairs or his attitudes. <I><FONT color=brown>Public</FONT></I>, thus, is an extreme case among these words, suggesting a deliberate revealing of oneself to the populace at large: a <I><FONT color=brown>public</FONT></I> announcement that he would no longer be responsible for debts incurred by his wife; a <I><FONT color=brown>public</FONT></I> address on foreign policy; voracious audiences who turn the private lives of film stars into <I><FONT color=brown>public</FONT></I> scandals.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Candid">CANDID</A>, <A href="entry://Outspoken">OUTSPOKEN</A>, <A href="entry://Plain">PLAIN</A> (adj.), <A href="entry://Truthful">TRUTHFUL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Implicit">IMPLICIT</A>, private, secret, <A href="entry://Stealthy">STEALTHY</A>.</P>

<P>These words denote sensations of discomfort or suffering. <B><FONT color=blue>Pain</FONT></B> is the most general tern, and can be used in place of any of the others in this group. <I><FONT color=brown>Pain</FONT></I> can be of long or short duration, in a local or a general site, and of mild or strong intensity: anxious about an off-and-on <I><FONT color=brown>pain</FONT></I> in the abdomen. An <B><FONT color=blue>ache</FONT></B> is an often long-lasting <I><FONT color=brown>pain</FONT></I>, usually dull rather than sharp, associated with a particular organ or body part: a stomach <I><FONT color=brown>ache</FONT></I>; a tooth<I><FONT color=brown>ache</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>pang</FONT></B> is a sudden, sharp but transient <I><FONT color=brown>pain</FONT></I> that is likely to recur: the <I><FONT color=brown>pangs</FONT></I> of hunger. A <B><FONT color=blue>twinge</FONT></B> is very much like a <I><FONT color=brown>pang</FONT></I>, but milder in intensity and often one that causes a muscle to contract: a <I><FONT color=brown>twinge</FONT></I> of rheumatism. A <B><FONT color=blue>throe</FONT></B> (usually found in its plural form) is a violent, often convulsive pain, such as that associated with a mortal wound, the effects of many poisons, or a violent physical process: the <I><FONT color=brown>throes</FONT></I> of childbirth. A sudden, sharp, piercing <I><FONT color=brown>pain</FONT></I>, often followed by a cramp, is called a <B><FONT color=blue>stitch</FONT></B>: a <I><FONT color=brown>stitch</FONT></I> in her side that made her wince.</P><P>All these words except <I><FONT color=brown>stitch</FONT></I> have figurative application to mental or spiritual suffering: the <I><FONT color=brown>pain</FONT></I> of separation; the <I><FONT color=brown>ache</FONT></I> of loneliness; a <I><FONT color=brown>pang</FONT></I> of remorse; the <I><FONT color=brown>throes</FONT></I> of indecision; a <I><FONT color=brown>twinge</FONT></I> of regret.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Harm">HARM</A>, <A href="entry://Hurt">HURT</A>, <A href="entry://Misery">MISERY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things, particularly complexions, that are lacking in colour. <B><FONT color=blue>Pale</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of these. It is the only word here that can refer to a relative lightness of colour that is permanent or natural: <I><FONT color=brown>pale</FONT></I> Scandinavians and swarthy Italian; choosing the <I><FONT color=brown>palest</FONT></I> shade of blue for the bathroom. More often the word suggests a temporary loss of colour because of emotion or sickness: growing <I><FONT color=brown>pale</FONT></I> with fear; looking feeble and <I><FONT color=brown>pale</FONT></I> from his long illness. In these cases, it is the change in colour that the word emphasizes. The change need not be negative, however: The eastern horizon was <I><FONT color=brown>pale</FONT></I> with the first hint of dawn. Because of the word’s association with illness, it can refer more generally to an undesirable weakness or dullness: a <I><FONT color=brown>pale</FONT></I> performance in an otherwise strong cast. <B><FONT color=blue>Ashen</FONT></B> is a much more restricted intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>pale</FONT></I>; it refers mainly to an extreme but possibly temporary loss of facial colour and usually points to an abnormal or undesirable state: a face <I><FONT color=brown>ashen</FONT></I> with shock; troops that looked haggard and <I><FONT color=brown>ashen</FONT></I> from the long march; the ashen, pinched features typical of undernourished children. The word can also refer to the greyish, dull appearance of something that has been vividly coloured: storm clouds that turned the bright summer sky <I><FONT color=brown>ashen</FONT></I> and sombre. <B><FONT color=blue>Cadaverous</FONT></B> is an even more restricted and more intense substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>ashen</FONT></I>. It refers almost exclusively to a facial or bodily state and indicates a more permanent unhealthy or deathly look. In addition as well: the bony, <I><FONT color=brown>cadaverous</FONT></I> faces of fashion models; the <I><FONT color=brown>cadaverous</FONT></I> survivors of Auschwitz. Although the word compares this kind of look to that of a corpse, <I><FONT color=brown>cadaverous</FONT></I> is usually used to describe a living person.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pallid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wan</FONT></B> are both more formal than the foregoing; both can sound somewhat archaic or precious. <I><FONT color=brown>Pallid</FONT></I> particularly has been overused as a more genteel or supposedly more elegant substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>pale</FONT></I>. In reference to facial appearance, the word concentrates on unhealthy states rather than those resulting from temporary emotional seizures: the sick child’s <I><FONT color=brown>pallid</FONT></I> cheeks. It would sound incorrect or affected to describe with this word things naturally lacking colour, e.g., <I><FONT color=brown>pallid</FONT></I> snow. The word is useful as a disapproving word for anything that is dull, dreary or unspirited: facing the crisis with inept of formulas and <I><FONT color=brown>pallid</FONT></I> lack of imagination. Here, the word’s suggestion of preciosity is sometimes consciously brought to bear with critical intent: <I><FONT color=brown>pallid</FONT></I> Victorian poetry. <I><FONT color=brown>Wan</FONT></I> is more restricted to facial appearance and less open to criticism on the grounds of preciosity; it emphasizes a loss of vigour, temporary or permanent: the <I><FONT color=brown>wan</FONT></I> faces of coal miners who seldom saw the sun; <I><FONT color=brown>wan</FONT></I> and wasted by disease.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Livid</FONT></B> has almost lost any usefulness it once may have had by the contradictory meanings it has gathered to itself. Coming from a root referring to the colour blue, the word can refer clinically to a bruised, discoloured skin. Many people would tend to misunderstand the word when used in this way. Parallel to this use, the word can refer to a face flushed or purplish from intense emotion, particularly rage: absolutely livid when he heard the news. The connection with rage has become so customary that no change in colouration is suggested by the word. In contrast to this and to the word’s suggestion of a flushed or a bluish cast, <I><FONT color=brown>livid</FONT></I> can also indicate a colourless or ashen appearance: the <I><FONT color=brown>livid</FONT></I> lips of the corpse. Some purists insist that only this last suggestion is valid, but such a use would be widely misunderstood.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bony">BONY</A>, <A href="entry://Gruesome">GRUESOME</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: colourful, flushed, glowing, ruddy.</P>

<P>These words refer to large areas of usually level country which may be farm or grazing land, or unsettled wilderness. <B><FONT color=blue>Plain</FONT></B> is the general word here for such countryside, giving no information in itself as to fertility or other topographical facts: <I><FONT color=brown>plains</FONT></I> that stretched for hundreds of miles; the cities of the <I><FONT color=brown>plain</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Steppe</FONT></B> suggests a specific geographical locale ?that of Russia ?but is otherwise general, like <I><FONT color=brown>plain</FONT></I>, with as little indication of fertility or infertility: Mongol tribes that fanned out across the <I><FONT color=brown>steppes</FONT></I>. While <B><FONT color=blue>desert</FONT></B> suggests no geographical placement, it does specifically point to barren and infertile regions lacking in rainfall and composed mainly of sandy soil or undulating sand dunes: the Simpson <I><FONT color=brown>Desert</FONT></I> of Central Australia; an irrigation project to make the <I><FONT color=brown>desert</FONT></I> fruitful.</P><P>All the other words here point to a specific kind of countryside and suggest, as well, a specific geographical locale. <B><FONT color=blue>Prairie</FONT></B> suggests the fertile but largely unforested <I><FONT color=brown>plains</FONT></I> of the U.S. Midwest: the rich loam of Nebraska <I><FONT color=brown>prairies</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Veldt</FONT></B> points to the fertile plains of South Africa; these are by and large grassy but unforested and filled with an array of wildlife. Unlike the <I><FONT color=brown>prairies</FONT></I> of North America, much of the <I><FONT color=brown>veldt</FONT></I> has not been converted into farmland, and is still wild and pristine. <B><FONT color=blue>Bush</FONT></B> suggests, less exclusively, land that is wild, unsettled and covered with scrub growth, as in East Africa: steps taken by the Kenya government to encourage cattle-raising in the <I><FONT color=brown>bush</FONT></I>. The word is applied also to the backcountry of certain other lands, including Australia and New Zealand, designating an extensive, unsettled or sparsely populated region thought of as being uncivilized, rugged or wild. It is also used generally in Australia for areas of limited population, even though close to or coming within the boundaries of major cities or towns. The Canadian <I><FONT color=brown>bush</FONT></I> is unsettled northern forest land.</P><P>The <B><FONT color=blue>pampas</FONT></B> are the great treeless <I><FONT color=brown>plains</FONT></I> of South America, extending from the Atlantic to the Andes, south of the Amazon River. Like the East African <I><FONT color=brown>bush</FONT></I> country, the <I><FONT color=brown>pampas</FONT></I> are used mainly for cattle grazing, the land not being fertile enough to yield much in the way of cereal crops: gauchos who muster cattle out on the Argentine <I><FONT color=brown>pampas</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Range</FONT></B> is the equivalent Nor American term for the same kind of countryside or <I><FONT color=brown>desert</FONT></I> on the western, intermingling features of both.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Savanna</FONT></B>, used of country in the south-east part of the U.S., designates a tract of level, treeless land covered with low vegetation. More broadly, the term refers to a large area of tropical or subtropical grassland, such as an African pasture or a South American campo, covered in part with trees and spiny shrubs, and found in regions undergoing alternate rainy and dry seasons. <B><FONT color=blue>Tundra</FONT></B>, by contrast, refers to a flat or rolling, treeless, often marshy plain of Arctic or near-Arctic regions, as of Siberia, the Scandinavian countries and the Eskimo-inhabited parts of North America. The <I><FONT color=brown>tundras</FONT></I> have permanently frozen subsoil and are poor in vegetation, though they are covered with moss in summer and furnish forage for such animals as reindeer: Finns who raise reindeer on the <I><FONT color=brown>tundra</FONT></I> in northern Finland.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Backblocks">BACKBLOCKS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Mountain">MOUNTAIN</A>.</P>

<P>These verbs mean to treat someone with special favour, care, protectiveness or privilege. To <B><FONT color=blue>pamper</FONT></B> someone is to cater to him, to furnish him with everything he needs for ease or comfort: to <I><FONT color=brown>pamper</FONT></I> an invalid. <I><FONT color=brown>Pamper</FONT></I> may imply treatment so tender as to weakening or debilitating: an aristocracy so <I><FONT color=brown>pampered</FONT></I> and over-protected that it could not cope with change. Whereas to <I><FONT color=brown>pamper</FONT></I> someone is to lap him in luxury, to <B><FONT color=blue>indulge</FONT></B> him is to let him have what he wants or does as he likes. Indulgence involves making an exception, yielding to wishes or inclinations usually denied; it suggests a relaxing of normal or proper restraint and a permissive sanctioning of pleasure. A person may <I><FONT color=brown>indulge</FONT></I> himself or another person: <I><FONT color=brown>indulging</FONT></I> oneself in the luxury of sleeping late; a grandmother who <I><FONT color=brown>indulges</FONT></I> the children so much that she undermines parental discipline. Preferences, desires and needs may also be <I><FONT color=brown>indulged</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>indulging</FONT></I> a taste for wine to the point of insobriety. One <B><FONT color=blue>humours</FONT></B> only other people. To humour someone is to go along with him, complying with his moods, fancies or capricious demands, though they may seem silly. [He <I><FONT color=brown>humoured</FONT></I> his wife and drove back to the house to see if the gas stove was turned off; Though tired, he pretended he was a comic-book hero to <I><FONT color=brown>humour</FONT></I> the child.]</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>baby</FONT></B> someone is to treat him like a helpless infant who can’t act on his own or assume responsibility. To <B><FONT color=blue>coddle</FONT></B> a person is to treat him with much more solicitude than he warrants, going to great lengths to spare or protect him. <B><FONT color=blue>Mollycoddle</FONT></B> means much the same as <I><FONT color=brown>coddle</FONT></I>, but it is a stronger word particularly suggestive of the over-protection by which some mothers insulated their sons from experience and hardship, thus making them infantile or effeminate. <I><FONT color=brown>Baby</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>coddle</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>mollycoddle</FONT></I> are often used sarcastically or in exaggeration. [They <I><FONT color=brown>babied</FONT></I> you in high school, but you'll have to stand on your own two feet at university; You're in the Army now, men, so don’t expect any <I><FONT color=brown>coddling</FONT></I> here; He claimed people on unemployment relief were being <I><FONT color=brown>mollycoddled</FONT></I>.]</P><P>Alone among these verbs, <B><FONT color=blue>spoil</FONT></B> emphasizes effect, the damage to the disposition resulting from over-indulgence. According to folk psychology, one <I><FONT color=brown>spoils</FONT></I> a child by giving in to his whims and whinings, letting him have his way, according him privileges he hasn’t earned and doesn’t deserve; as a result, he may well come to demand special privileges as a matter of right, and may become self-centred, conceited and selfish. [Stop acting like a <I><FONT color=brown>spoilt</FONT></I> child; His grandparents would <I><FONT color=brown>spoil</FONT></I> him if we let them.] An adult may be <I><FONT color=brown>spoilt</FONT></I> in a different way by growing used to unaccustomed luxuries, so that he can no longer be content with what he had before.

<P>These words refer to someone who attaches himself to someone else in order to gain a portion of the latter’s money, goods or advantages. <B><FONT color=blue>Parasite</FONT></B> and leech both call to mind biological organisms that attach themselves physically to a host as a source of nourishment, often harming the host’s health or causing death. <I><FONT color=brown>Parasite</FONT></I> is the generic term for all such forms of life; <B><FONT color=blue>leech</FONT></B> refers specifically to a bloodsucking worm that acts in this way.

The word can suggest a weak, spineless sort of person who gains another’s confidence by hypocrisy or subterfuge. <I><FONT color=brown>Leech</FONT></I>, by contrast, is much harsher in its disapproval and indicates both a more ravening and more tenacious approach: <I><FONT color=brown>leeches</FONT></I> who clung fast to him while there was the slightest advantage to be obtained from his prodigality; such a <I><FONT color=brown>leech</FONT></I> that his patron was driven into bankruptcy.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Freeloader</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sponger</FONT></B> are more informal than the previous pair and suggest a more hit-and-miss approach to gaining benefits from others. <I><FONT color=brown>Freeloader</FONT></I>, the most informal of these words, suggests someone who makes himself easily available to partake of someone else’s hospitality, with no thought of ever returning it. The word is particularly suggestive of the hasty and voluminous dispatch of someone else’s food and drink: a <I><FONT color=brown>freeloader</FONT></I> who invited himself to dinner three or four times before we woke up to him; <I><FONT color=brown>freeloaders</FONT></I> at the party who found the host’s expensive Scotch and made short work of it. <I><FONT color=brown>Sponger</FONT></I> refers to a person with any sort of gain in mind; the word may be especially suggestive of an inveterate borrower who doesn’t return borrowed items, or of a person in a public place who ingratiates himself to get free drink or food: fearing that borrowing a cup of sugar would make her new neighbour think she was a <I><FONT color=brown>sponger</FONT></I>; King’s Cross <I><FONT color=brown>spongers</FONT></I> adept at getting Americans to buy them endless rounds of drinks. As can be seen, the word need not imply a permanent relationship; it is less severe in its criticism than <I><FONT color=brown>freeloader</FONT></I> and certainly less so than the previous words. <B><FONT color=blue>Cadger</FONT></B> is close in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>sponger</FONT></I> but denotes a pettier, more begging attitude on the part of the borrower: He <I><FONT color=brown>cadged</FONT></I> a free ride to the office every morning; <I><FONT color=brown>cadging</FONT></I> a few dollars from his old, widowed mother.</P><P>In its original meaning, <B><FONT color=blue>bludger</FONT></B> referred to a man who lived on the earnings of a harlot; time and usage have softened the word to mean no more than a man who takes profit without effort ?and usually to the detriment of another person: a <I><FONT color=brown>bludger</FONT></I> who spends most of his time at the races while his wife goes out to work. <I><FONT color=brown>Bludger</FONT></I> is not so clinging in its connotation as parasite or <I><FONT color=brown>leech</FONT></I>, but is harsher in condemnation than <I><FONT color=brown>freeloader</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>sponger</FONT></I>. In many contexts <I><FONT color=brown>bludger</FONT></I> simply means loafer, as much as one prepared to let other provide for him.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hanger-on</FONT></B> is the mildest of these words, suggesting someone who has formed a more lasting relationship with his host. Rather than snatch at benefits, the <I><FONT color=brown>hanger-on</FONT></I> may simply wait timidly for benefits as they are offered: a <I><FONT color=brown>hanger-on</FONT></I> who seemed always to the present, as though in hopes of getting some dropped scrap of affection; <I><FONT color=brown>hangers-on</FONT></I> who were content to flatter him in exchange for the lavish parties he gave.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Fawn">FAWN</A>, <A href="entry://Obsequious">OBSEQUIOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: host.</P>

<P>These words mean to free a person from the consequences of his guilt or to pass over a blameworthy action without censure or punishment. <B><FONT color=blue>Pardon</FONT></B> is a more formal term than <B><FONT color=blue>forgive</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>excuse</FONT></B>, and in its strictest sense implies the authority to waive punishment in an official way: unjustly convicted of murder, he was <I><FONT color=brown>pardoned</FONT></I> after fresh evidence had come to light. [A wife <I><FONT color=brown>forgives</FONT></I> an unfaithful husband; A saint <I><FONT color=brown>forgives</FONT></I> his enemies.] <I><FONT color=brown>Excuse</FONT></I> is to forgive a minor offence, breach of etiquette, etc.: We <I><FONT color=brown>excused</FONT></I> his brusqueness because we knew he was under a severe strain. <I><FONT color=brown>Excuse</FONT></I> may also be used of larger offences that are not criminal or of a personal nature: The company <I><FONT color=brown>excused</FONT></I> the watchman for falling asleep while on duty. <I><FONT color=brown>Pardon</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>forgive</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>excuse</FONT></I> are all used in polite exchanges to convey regret for having caused slight inconvenience to another. In this usage, <I><FONT color=brown>pardon</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>forgive</FONT></I> tend to sound stilted and sententious and are used less often than <I><FONT color=brown>excuse</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>excuse</FONT></I> oneself for addressing a stranger with a request for directions.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Condone</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>overlook</FONT></B> mean to <I><FONT color=brown>pardon</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>forgive</FONT></I> tacitly, by accepting, without redress, actions and situations that merit censure. <I><FONT color=brown>Condone</FONT></I> suggests the toleration of more serious offences than does <I><FONT color=brown>overlook</FONT></I> ?offences of a public nature, such as breaches of the law: Child labour is still <I><FONT color=brown>condoned</FONT></I> in some countries by officials who consider themselves upright and conscientious. One also <I><FONT color=brown>condones</FONT></I> faults that are similar to one’s own: A man who cheats on his income tax and on his expense account tends to <I><FONT color=brown>condone</FONT></I> these practices in his friends. <I><FONT color=brown>Overlook</FONT></I>, a less strong word than <I><FONT color=brown>condone</FONT></I>, suggests an indulgent disregard of unimportant lapses in behaviour: to <I><FONT color=brown>overlook</FONT></I> a child’s sloppy table manners; to <I><FONT color=brown>overlook</FONT></I> a bright student’s failure to complete a project on time.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Remit</FONT></B>, once a close synonym of <I><FONT color=brown>pardon</FONT></I>, is the most formal of all these terms and its use is limited to ecclesiastical and legal contexts: to <I><FONT color=brown>remit</FONT></I> sins; to <I><FONT color=brown>remit</FONT></I> a fine for disturbing the peace.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Exonerate">EXONERATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: condemn, convict, penalize, punish.</P>

<P>These words refer to something looked at as an entity in isolation from the whole of which it is a member. <B><FONT color=blue>Part</FONT></B> is the most general of these, referring to a quantity, sometimes amorphous or unspecified, of a particular whole: asking for a <I><FONT color=brown>part</FONT></I> of his sandwich; in one <I><FONT color=brown>part</FONT></I> of the book I’m reading. It can refer also to some independently structured member of a totality: the spare <I><FONT color=brown>parts</FONT></I> needed to repair his car.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Piece</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>portion</FONT></B> relate exclusively to that aspect of part suggesting a quantity drawn from a whole. <I><FONT color=brown>Piece</FONT></I> is especially appropriate in reference to flat stretches of material, such as land or cloth: a <I><FONT color=brown>piece</FONT></I> of property; <I><FONT color=brown>piece</FONT></I> of calico. The word can also be used for other quantities: a <I><FONT color=brown>piece</FONT></I> to abstract qualities: a cafeteria that serves lavish <I><FONT color=brown>portions</FONT></I>; a man who possesses enviable <I><FONT color=brown>portions</FONT></I> of wisdom and tolerance. <I><FONT color=brown>Portion</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>piece</FONT></I>, also has a specific use in reference to a quantity of time: spending a <I><FONT color=brown>portion</FONT></I> of each summer at the seaside. <B><FONT color=blue>Passage</FONT></B> is more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>portion</FONT></I> and is even more commonly used to refer to periods of time, especially to elapsed time: a <I><FONT color=brown>passage</FONT></I> of ten years during which I did very little travelling. It also has a special use in reference to <I><FONT color=brown>parts</FONT></I> of art works, such as literature and music: a <I><FONT color=brown>passage</FONT></I> from the Second Symphony that echoed in his mind whenever he thought of Paris; the <I><FONT color=brown>passage</FONT></I> in his book in which he comes out most strongly for freedom of the press.</P><P>The remaining words all refer to clearly defined entities or groupings within a larger, structured unity. <B><FONT color=blue>Subdivision</FONT></B> is the most specific of these, suggesting a rigid logical organization of part to part within a complex framework, such as a bureaucracy, a schematic drawing of surveyed land, a legal document with numbered or lettered paragraphs, or any detailed outline or system of classification: such catalogued <I><FONT color=brown>subdivisions</FONT></I> of non-fiction as biography, history and travel. <B><FONT color=blue>Segment</FONT></B> can refer to a specified part of a geometrical figure or to some natural <I><FONT color=brown>subdivision</FONT></I>: Arcs are <I><FONT color=brown>segments</FONT></I> of circles. It can also be used as a more formal word for a <I><FONT color=brown>piece</FONT></I> of some linear quantity, such as thread or wire: laying a new <I><FONT color=brown>segment</FONT></I> of cable to connect the two stations. <I><FONT color=brown>Section</FONT></I> is the least specific of these three words; it is more closely restricted than <I><FONT color=brown>segment</FONT></I> to refer to a structured part of an organized entity, but suggests less complexity than <I><FONT color=brown>subdivision</FONT></I>: that <I><FONT color=brown>section</FONT></I> of the Department of Civil Aviation dealing with ground facilities; a wealthy <I><FONT color=brown>section</FONT></I> of town. When it approaches <I><FONT color=brown>part</FONT></I> in generality, it suggests a definable slice of a whole, sometimes isolated for the convenience of close inspection: calling his attention to a <I><FONT color=brown>section</FONT></I> of the portrait in which a later over-painting was clearly noticeable; the <I><FONT color=brown>section</FONT></I> of her will in which she disposed of her household effects.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Addition">ADDITION</A>, <A href="entry://Component">COMPONENT</A>, <A href="entry://Fragment">FRAGMENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: entirety, entity, gestalt, totality, unit, whole.</P>

<P>These words refer to the compassion, concern or empathy that can, or should, be aroused by viewing the situation of another living thing. <B><FONT color=blue>Pathetic</FONT></B> pertains to compassionate concern or sorrow that is or should be inspired by those less fortunate than oneself. The word stresses circumstances in which a sufferer is reduced to abject helplessness: the <I><FONT color=brown>pathetic</FONT></I> struggle of the rabbit to free itself from the steel jaws of the trap; those <I><FONT color=brown>pathetic</FONT></I> cases in which a child gets little love from either parent; his <I><FONT color=brown>pathetic</FONT></I> cries for help. The word usually implies that an innocent victim has unjustly or unfairly been harmed through no fault of his own. <B><FONT color=blue>Pitiful</FONT></B> may be used exactly like <I><FONT color=brown>pathetic</FONT></I>, but it has a wider range of use beyond this context. It can, for example, be used even when the victim may have contributed to his own plight or is wholly responsible for it: the <I><FONT color=brown>pitiful</FONT></I> loneliness of the alcoholic. It may also be used of someone who may not see himself as victimized in any way and who, in fact, may seem more fortunate than oneself: the king’s <I><FONT color=brown>pitiful</FONT></I> outbursts of incoherent rage against his most loyal advisers; strutting and boasting about his virility in a most <I><FONT color=brown>pitiful</FONT></I> way.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Poignant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>touching</FONT></B> are closely related: they both depart from the situation of victimization or misfortune to indicate anything that arouses one’s tender compassion or empathy. <I><FONT color=brown>Touching</FONT></I> is the more informal of the two, suggesting a winning appeal or inevitably affecting scene: the mother cat’s <I><FONT color=brown>touching</FONT></I> zeal for the welfare of her kittens; his <I><FONT color=brown>touching</FONT></I> request that he be given one last chance to prove himself. The word most commonly suggests an audience that is actually affected by the scene, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>pathetic</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>pitiful</FONT></I> may imply no audience at all or one that is hard-hearted: a <I><FONT color=brown>pathetic</FONT></I> figure that no one, in the rush of indifferent passers-by, found the least bit <I><FONT color=brown>touching</FONT></I>. This same distinction holds for <I><FONT color=brown>poignant</FONT></I>, which stresses the actual arousal of a bittersweet responsiveness that mingles pity and longing or other contradictory emotions. The word once emphasized the presence of any sort of keen, sharp feelings, but it now more often points to an ambivalence inherent in subtle or gentle shades of compassion, wistfulness or nostalgia: Her <I><FONT color=brown>pitiful</FONT></I> face had not seemed <I><FONT color=brown>touching</FONT></I> to him at the time, but recalling it now filled him with a <I><FONT color=brown>poignant</FONT></I> sorrow and delight.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Moving</FONT></B> functions more like touching and poignant than <I><FONT color=brown>pathetic</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>pitiful</FONT></I>, but it suggests the actual arousal of stronger emotions than any of these words, applying to compassion and empathy and also to a wide range of emotions beyond them: the anger he aroused by his <I><FONT color=brown>moving</FONT></I> demand for an investigation of the tragic fire: a <I><FONT color=brown>moving</FONT></I> scene of reconciliation at the end of the short story. Except when applied to a work of art, the word often suggests an arousal to specific action: a <I><FONT color=brown>moving</FONT></I> appeal that the <I><FONT color=brown>pathetic</FONT></I> victims of the plot be compensated for the injustices they had suffered. <B><FONT color=blue>Pitiable</FONT></B> is unique among these words in stressing that someone is deserving of pity whether or not this condition is noticed by others ?or even detectable by them: a <I><FONT color=brown>pitiable</FONT></I> emptiness that he kept hidden under an outwardly happy and successful life; poverty made all the more <I><FONT color=brown>pitiable</FONT></I> by the indifference of the town’s more fortunate citizens.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Miserable">MISERABLE</A>, <A href="entry://None">PATHETIC</A>, <A href="entry://Sad">SAD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: farcical, ludicrous, ridiculous, unaffecting.</P>

patience
<B><FONT color=blue>patience</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>forbearance</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>long-suffering</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>masochism</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>resignation</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stoicism</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sufferance</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a voluntary self-control, restraint or passivity that helps one to endure waiting, provocation, injustice, suffering or any of the unpleasant vicissitudes of time and life. <B><FONT color=blue>Patience</FONT></B> is almost exclusively positive in tone. Most often it refers to a willingness to wait without becoming disgruntled or anxious: showing great <I><FONT color=brown>patience</FONT></I> while waiting to learn the outcome of the election. More generally, the word can suggest a kindly tolerance for other people’s shortcomings, including a particular ability to remain unperturbed by someone else’s slowness or other quirks: the <I><FONT color=brown>patience</FONT></I> with which she went over the lesson until the dullest student in the class could understand it; responding with a kind of blank <I><FONT color=brown>patience</FONT></I> to his roommate’s noisy comings and goings. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>patience</FONT></I> implies little difficulty in putting up with annoying situations, <B><FONT color=blue>forbearance</FONT></B> specifically indicates a determined struggle against giving vent to intense feelings that beset one. Thus, the word’s stress is on self-controlled abstinence from hasty or ill-tempered action, whatever the provocation: answering with such <I><FONT color=brown>forbearance</FONT></I> that only his flushed face showed how angry he really was. In this sense, the word is positive in tone, more strongly so than the blandness of <I><FONT color=brown>patience</FONT></I> and its implications of passivity. But <I><FONT color=brown>forbearance</FONT></I> can refer less positively to an attitude that is disposed to put up with or endure annoyance or actual harm: a wife no longer willing to meet her husband’s bullying with docile <I><FONT color=brown>forbearance</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sufferance</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>long-suffering</FONT></B> both suggest the passive endurance of pain or wretchedness, and as such both emphasize passive submission. This attitude can as easily be presented as a positive virtue or as a failure of nerve. Of the two words, <I><FONT color=brown>sufferance</FONT></I> suggests a more conscious choice in indicating the ability, possibly learnt, to endure pain or evil that might destroy someone else: their <I><FONT color=brown>sufferance</FONT></I> of the scapegoat’s role through centuries of maltreatment. More often, the word may suggest a generous tolerance for the foibles of others ?or an immoral or permissive failure to take a stand in the face of evil: pragmatic in his good-humoured <I><FONT color=brown>sufferance</FONT></I> of his student’s pranks; the average citizen’s apathetic <I><FONT color=brown>sufferance</FONT></I> of the régime’s repressive laws against the Jews. <I><FONT color=brown>Long-suffering</FONT></I> is more informal and less wide-ranging in usage, referring to the patience with which injuries or misfortunes are endured, especially over a great period of time: facing his wife’s invalidism with grimness and <I><FONT color=brown>long-suffering</FONT></I>. The word can also be negative when it suggests a person who glories self-pityingly in his own unhappiness at great length and with much verbal ado, but without attempting to alter the situation: the tedious <I><FONT color=brown>long-suffering</FONT></I> with which she recounted every failing of her husband.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stoicism</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>resignation</FONT></B> refer to a more profound and abiding general life-view than do the previous words. <I><FONT color=brown>Stoicism</FONT></I> most specifically names the philosophy originated by <I><FONT color=brown>Zeno</FONT></I>, who advised men to be superior to all life’s passions ?joy, grief, pleasure, pain. In general use, the word is taken to refer mainly to the ability to endure physical pain or mental anguish. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>long-suffering</FONT></I>, even the popular sense of <I><FONT color=brown>stoicism</FONT></I> emphatically stresses the enduring of pain without complaint or comment of any sort and usually with complete equanimity: the <I><FONT color=brown>stoicism</FONT></I> of Mohicans who could be tortured to death without their once crying out for mercy. Only in ethical or philosophical discussion can the word take on a critical tone, suggesting a sterile attitude in which evil is accepted as inevitable rather than actively opposed: an invidious <I><FONT color=brown>stoicism</FONT></I> that allowed otherwise decent citizens to tolerate fundamental affronts to their own self-respect. <B><FONT color=blue>Resignation</FONT></B> is much more likely than <I><FONT color=brown>stoicism</FONT></I> to be ambiguous in tone. In pointing to unresisting acquiescence and surrender to the inevitable, especially to misfortune, the word can suggest a noble or dignified response to tragedy ?or a craven acceptance of an ignoble or degrading situation: the stark <I><FONT color=brown>resignation</FONT></I> with which she stood beside her husband’s coffin; railing at the <I><FONT color=brown>resignation</FONT></I> with which most ratepayers viewed the patent land-development machinations of the local council. The word can also be less charged with emotion, like <I><FONT color=brown>patience</FONT></I>, when force or compulsion is present: hopeless <I><FONT color=brown>resignation</FONT></I> to his fate after twenty years of incarceration in the Bastille.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Masochism</FONT></B> is related to the other words here in that it refers to the enduring of pain, but it is in sharp contrast to them by indicating a neurotic willingness to suffer or even the conscious or unconscious seeking out of painful experiences: the <I><FONT color=brown>masochism</FONT></I> inherent in drug addiction. The word is drawn from psychiatric terminology, where it is sometimes compounded with its opposite in the term <I><FONT color=brown>sado-masochism</FONT></I> because of the intimate connection between the neurotic pleasures of inflicting and suffering pain. But <I><FONT color=brown>masochism</FONT></I> is used widely outside the clinical context for any tendency towards assuming a martyr’s role, enjoying one’s own miseries, or exposing oneself to needless pain: Only a streak of <I><FONT color=brown>masochism</FONT></I> in her could have permitted her to marry such a brutal man.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aloof">ALOOF</A>, <A href="entry://Heedless">HEEDLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Misery">MISERY</A>, <A href="entry://Numb">NUMB</A>, <A href="entry://Pain">PAIN</A>, <A href="entry://Sloth">SLOTH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anger">ANGER</A>, impatience, militance, restiveness, sadism.</P>

patter
<B><FONT color=blue>patter</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>chit-chat</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>palaver</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>small talk</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to glib or trivial discussion or conversation. <B><FONT color=blue>Patter</FONT></B> is the most general of these. It emphasizes rapidity and insincerity of speech, whereas <B><FONT color=blue>palaver</FONT></B> stresses a lack of real content and a tendency towards unnecessary solemnity. <I><FONT color=brown>Patter</FONT></I> can indicate mechanical recitation, reflecting its derivation from a reference to the hasty saying of the Paternoster; it can also refer to rehearsed comedy routines, and a kind of comic song in which the words are uttered with great rapidity and oral dexterity, or to bodies of dialect or jargon. Drawing from this range of use, <I><FONT color=brown>patter</FONT></I> in its conversational context adds to the emphasis on rapidity connotations of rehearsed or at least predictable conversational patterns: the conventional <I><FONT color=brown>patter</FONT></I> exchanged at afternoon-tea parties; tedious <I><FONT color=brown>patter</FONT></I> about the warm weather and high prices. A note of condescension is usually present. <I><FONT color=brown>Palaver</FONT></I> is also condescending, suggesting solemn exchanges that are without substance. The word can refer to a public discussion or conference, reflecting its original reference to a parley between natives and an explorer or missionary; here the condescension is quite clear. More often, the word can refer to an informal group talk, possibly assembled in haste to decide on a course of action: the <I><FONT color=brown>palaver</FONT></I> of neighbours gathered in front of the house from which the strange sounds were coming.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chit-chat</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>small talk</FONT></B> are both restricted to idle conversation. <I><FONT color=brown>Chit-chat</FONT></I>, the most informal of all these words, combines the predictability suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>patter</FONT></I> with the lack of substance indicated by palaver. In contrast to patter, it may point to a slow or low-keyed tempo and, unlike palaver, does not suggest group discussion so much as a random exchange of banalities or gossip: the kind of <I><FONT color=brown>chit-chat</FONT></I> that was a sure sign the cocktail party was dying on its feet. <I><FONT color=brown>Small talk</FONT></I>, by contrast, also refers to low-key and trivial talk but suggests, as well, that such a conversational vein may be the result of choice or inhibition and may serve as an ice-breaker or a prelude to more interesting matter: waiting for the <I><FONT color=brown>small talk</FONT></I> to finish and the real discussion to begin; rehearsing bits of <I><FONT color=brown>small talk</FONT></I> with which to worm her way into interesting conversations she might overhear at the party.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chatter">CHATTER</A>, <A href="entry://Conversation">CONVERSATION</A>, <A href="entry://Joke">JOKE</A>, raillery.</P>

<P>These words are used to describe people who are poor, who do not have enough money to maintain a decent standard of live, or who have lost their means of subsistence. <B><FONT color=blue>Penniless</FONT></B> frequently refers to someone who has undergone a sudden, calamitous loss of money and property, but who, as a result, may not actually be in real want. [After the share-market crash, many wealthy men found themselves <I><FONT color=brown>penniless</FONT></I>; His father cut John out of his will and left him <I><FONT color=brown>penniless</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Penniless</FONT></I> may also be applied to those who make no real <I><FONT color=brown>penniless</FONT></I> hangers-on in every bar; a <I><FONT color=brown>penniless</FONT></I> artist who devoted all his energies to his painting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Poverty-stricken</FONT></B> is the most comprehensive term and may be substituted for all the other words in this group. It is generally used to describe people who lack the material possessions to make life even passably comfortable, either through economic stress or because, as in the case of members of some religious orders, they have chosen a way of life in which they must forgo many necessities and all luxuries. <I><FONT color=brown>Poverty-stricken</FONT></I> points to a condition that is more or less hopeless and permanent, or at least tends to go on for a long period: <I><FONT color=brown>poverty-stricken</FONT></I> tenant farmers who never realize any cash profit from their crops. The word is used also to describe conditions and situations which exhibit or even cause poverty: a <I><FONT color=brown>poverty-stricken</FONT></I> country with little industry; The camps of <I><FONT color=brown>poverty-stricken</FONT></I> Aborigines on the outskirts of some Australian country towns.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Destitute</FONT></B> emphasizes poverty of such severity that one is deprived of such basic necessities as food, clothing and shelter: a <I><FONT color=brown>destitute</FONT></I> family evicted for not paying rent; <I><FONT color=brown>destitute</FONT></I>, lost children wandering about in a bombed-out city.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indigent</FONT></B> indicates a state of less dire want than do <I><FONT color=brown>poverty-stricken</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>destitute</FONT></I>, and it is sometimes used in opposition to affluent. <I><FONT color=brown>Indigent</FONT></I> is applied to those suffering from a kind of "genteel" poverty in which circumstances are straitened but something of the former outward façade is preserved: The <I><FONT color=brown>indigent</FONT></I> old couple, who find it hard to make ends meet on a pension, keep their home neat and tidy.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>needy</FONT></B> person is one who may be <I><FONT color=brown>poverty-stricken</FONT></I>, or even <I><FONT color=brown>destitute</FONT></I>, but the word implies an inability to maintain oneself without some help from public or private assistance: Christmas dinners at a mission for the homeless and <I><FONT color=brown>needy</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>needy</FONT></I> children who receive free dental care at the clinic.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Necessitous</FONT></B> is a close synonym of <I><FONT color=brown>poverty-stricken</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>needy</FONT></I>, but it now tends to sound literary and is infrequently used today.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Insolvent">INSOLVENT</A>, <A href="entry://Poor">POOR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: affluent, flush, moneyed, opulent, rich, wealthy, well-off.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>perceive</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>descry</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>espy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>make out</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all mean to become aware of through one of the senses or to apprehend with the mind. <B><FONT color=blue>Perceive</FONT></B> is the most general term, since it has application to all the senses: a master chef who was able to <I><FONT color=brown>perceive</FONT></I> the most subtle seasoning used in any dish; a conductor who could <I><FONT color=brown>perceive</FONT></I> even the slightest variation from true pitch in each instrument. The word is most often used, of course, in reference to the sense of sight: to <I><FONT color=brown>perceive</FONT></I> a car coming towards one. But <I><FONT color=brown>perceive</FONT></I> has definite implications of recognition that are not present in the simple verb to see. [The object I saw in the distance was too shrouded in fog for me to be able to identify it, but when our car got closer to it I <I><FONT color=brown>perceived</FONT></I> it to be an old windmill.] <I><FONT color=brown>Perceive</FONT></I> denotes mental as well as sensuous observation when it is used to mean to come to understand: to <I><FONT color=brown>perceive</FONT></I> the nuances in different philosophical propositions; to <I><FONT color=brown>perceive</FONT></I> the difficulties inherent in a projected business enterprise.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Descry</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>espy</FONT></B> are sometimes used interchangeably because they both imply a catching sight of something that is partly hidden, in the distance or otherwise difficult to see. But there are differences between the words that should make their usage more precise. <I><FONT color=brown>Descry</FONT></I> suggests careful observation of the distant or obscure; there is more implication of effort and attention in <I><FONT color=brown>descry</FONT></I> than in <I><FONT color=brown>espy</FONT></I>, which hints at a chance, sudden or unexpected discovery. [A sentinel on the watchtower <I><FONT color=brown>descried</FONT></I> the approach of an enemy patrol; She turned round just in time to <I><FONT color=brown>espy</FONT></I> an old friend disappear in the crowd.] <I><FONT color=brown>Descry</FONT></I> also refers to the kind of discovery that is the property of the mind and not the eyes. In this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>descry</FONT></I> means to understand or come to realize by examination and investigation: to <I><FONT color=brown>descry</FONT></I> the true nature of a complicated crime; to <I><FONT color=brown>descry</FONT></I> the differences between two seemingly similar passages of music.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Make out</FONT></B> is a less formal term than the others in this group. It can mean to see, but it is less simple than that verb because of its suggestion of difficulty or effort. [The room was so dark it was impossible to <I><FONT color=brown>make</FONT></I> anything <I><FONT color=brown>out</FONT></I>.] It can also denote various kinds of mental seeing, as, for example, deciphering or understanding. [Can you <I><FONT color=brown>make out</FONT></I> the inscription on this old coin?; It was impossible to <I><FONT color=brown>make out</FONT></I> what she was getting at in her lecture.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Acumen">ACUMEN</A>, <A href="entry://Look">LOOK</A>, <A href="entry://See">SEE</A>, <A href="entry://Sensation">SENSATION</A>, <A href="entry://Vision">VISION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: misapprehend, misconceive, miss, overlook.</P>

perfect
<B><FONT color=blue>perfect</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>consummate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>flawless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ideal</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to something that is the ultimate of its kind. <B><FONT color=blue>Perfect</FONT></B> suggests completeness and lack of blemish; it may refer to something imaginary or, hyperbolically, to something that exists: the <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I> wife; having spent a <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I> evening. It can also mean utterly typical when referring to something that exists: a <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I> example of romanesque architecture. It may refer to negative attributes as well as positive, in this case stressing total demerit: a <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I> fool; a <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I> villain. <B><FONT color=blue>Flawless</FONT></B> relates closely to that aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I> which emphasizes lack of blemish: a <I><FONT color=brown>flawless</FONT></I> ruby. But <I><FONT color=brown>flawless</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I>, tends only to suggest a mere absence of negative qualities. Because of this, it is not used to indicate total imperfection; rarely would one find a reference to a <I><FONT color=brown>flawless</FONT></I> fool. Furthermore, something can be <I><FONT color=brown>flawless</FONT></I> and yet far from <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>flawless</FONT></I> but mediocre performance.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Consummate</FONT></B> is closely related to perfect in its sense of ultimate completeness: a <I><FONT color=brown>consummate</FONT></I> pianist. Here it gives an added overtone of slow maturation through disciplined effort. Like <I><FONT color=brown>flawless</FONT></I>, it does not usually refer to imagined excellence, largely because it stresses actually achieved qualities. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>flawless</FONT></I>, it is often used to suggest total badness, like perfect: a <I><FONT color=brown>consummate</FONT></I> liar.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ideal</FONT></B> has the most strongly positive implications of any of these words. It suggests the greatest excellence that one can imagine: an <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I> democracy that would require ideal citizens. If used to describe something that exists, the resulting hyperbole invites disbelief: the divorce that ended what everyone thought was an <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I> marriage. As with <I><FONT color=brown>flawless</FONT></I>, it would make little sense to speak of <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I> badness. While the word can mean archetypal in the philosophy of Platonism, this specialized use does not intrude into other meanings. <I><FONT color=brown>Ideal</FONT></I>, in general, is stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I> because something may be typical, complete or without blemish, and still be far form ideal. Of course, in ordinary use, these two words and the others are sometimes devalued to mean anything pleasant: a <I><FONT color=brown>perfect</FONT></I> evening; an <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I> holiday spot.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Entire">ENTIRE</A>, FULL-FLEDGED.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Deficient">DEFICIENT</A>, flawed, imperfect.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>perform</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>conduct</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>do</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>execute</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fulfil</FONT></B>:

<P>These verbs all mean to carry out in action, as an assignment or a task. <B><FONT color=blue>Perform</FONT></B> is precisely directed to this concept, though <B><FONT color=blue>do</FONT></B> is the most general term. When the two words are synonymous, <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> conveys a greater formality than <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I>, or implies a greater degree of difficulty and intricacy: to <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I> a trick; to <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> a feat; to <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I> odd jobs; to <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> an operation; to <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I> one’s best; to <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> a miracle. <I><FONT color=brown>Perform</FONT></I> also differs from <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I> in stressing the idea of a ritual or a formal public presentation: to <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> a christening ceremony; to <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> a symphony. It implies the rendering of a work or the carrying out of a rite that already exists, while <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I> may suggest spontaneity and improvisation: to <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> a play or a piece of music; to <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I> impressions. In another comparison, to <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I> a play is to undertake it and prepare it for presentation: The repertory company is <I><FONT color=brown>do</FONT></I>ing Ibsen this season. To <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> a play is to give it before an audience: They are <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I>ing Shakespeare in the park tonight.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Perform</FONT></I> can also mean to discharge an obligation, duty or command: He wouldn’t promise what he could not <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I>. In this sense, it is close to <B><FONT color=blue>fulfil</FONT></B>, which stresses the accomplishment of something pledged, hoped for or anticipated: to <I><FONT color=brown>fulfil</FONT></I> an obligation; to <I><FONT color=brown>fulfil</FONT></I> a parent’s expectations; to <I><FONT color=brown>fulfil</FONT></I> a campaign promise. <I><FONT color=brown>Fulfil</FONT></I> puts the greatest stress of all these words on completion or consummation, the realization of potential or capabilities. Hence it implies an ultimate <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I>ance: The prophecy was <I><FONT color=brown>fulfil</FONT></I>led; a novelist who never went on to <I><FONT color=brown>fulfil</FONT></I> his early promise.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conduct</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> but stresses direction, leadership or supervision: to <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I> an experiment; to <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I> a survey. In a specific sense, with reference to music, it is used of a single person and means to direct the <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I>ance of a work: to <I><FONT color=brown>conduct</FONT></I> an opera. <B><FONT color=blue>Execute</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> in several senses. It can suggest intricacy, meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> something demanding expert skill or faultless technique: to <I><FONT color=brown>execute</FONT></I> a tricky manoeuver; a ballerina executing a tour jeté; a skater executing a perfect figure eight. Or it can point to accomplishment, meaning to follow, carry out or put into effect: to <I><FONT color=brown>execute</FONT></I> an order. It differs from <I><FONT color=brown>perform</FONT></I> in another sense, in implying the creation of a work according to a plan or design rather than the artistic conception and rendering of a completed work: an artist skilfully executing a portrait; a builder executing an architect’s design.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artisan">ARTISAN</A>, <A href="entry://Commit">COMMIT</A>, <A href="entry://Performer">PERFORMER</A>, <A href="entry://Satisfy">SATISFY</A>.</P>

performer
<B><FONT color=blue>performer</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>agent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>doer</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>executive</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to someone who acts for himself or others. At its most general, <B><FONT color=blue>performer</FONT></B> may indicate the one who carries out an action: the <I><FONT color=brown>performer</FONT></I> of a double somersault. It may also indicate someone who can accomplish tasks or attain goals: children who are poor <I><FONT color=brown>performers</FONT></I> in school. In these senses, the word can also apply to inanimate objects: a report specifying those cars that were the best <I><FONT color=brown>performers</FONT></I>. On a more particular and less formal level, the word is much more widely used to indicate any sort of entertainer: clowns, acrobats and other circus <I><FONT color=brown>performers</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Doer</FONT></B> has no widely used specific sense, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>performer</FONT></I>, and is even less frequently used in its corresponding general sense: separating mankind into the <I><FONT color=brown>doers</FONT></I> and the dreamers. An archaic idiom survives, however, in modern usage: a <I><FONT color=brown>doer</FONT></I> of good works. In this sense it has slightly derogatory overtones. The word can also be used positively to describe one who gets on with things enthusiastically: good old Jim ?he’s real <I><FONT color=brown>doer</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Executive</FONT></B> at its most formal can refer to someone who actually does a job, either on his own behalf or for others; this is best illustrated by the compound nouns of certain titles. An <I><FONT color=brown>executive</FONT></I> director is one who actually directs the work of his group, although someone else may have the honorary tide of director. In its most common use, <I><FONT color=brown>executive</FONT></I> indicates a person who belongs to the beat-paid upper bracket of a business, the one concerned with decision-making; <I><FONT color=brown>executives</FONT></I> who rank high enough in the firm to have a private office with a window.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agent</FONT></B> refers to a person who does something, against a commission, on behalf of someone else.

<P>These words refer to a shape’s outside boundary, taken as a whole. <B><FONT color=blue>Perimeter</FONT></B> can refer both to the bounding lines that enclose a plane figure and the total length of this boundary: He posted No Trespass signs along the <I><FONT color=brown>perimeter</FONT></I> of his estate; the ins and outs of fjords that add hundreds of miles to the <I><FONT color=brown>perimeter</FONT></I> of the Norwegian coastline. The word can also refer to the outer edges of something far less clearly defined: the shifting <I><FONT color=brown>perimeters</FONT></I> of each task force in the battle zone. <B><FONT color=blue>Periphery</FONT></B> relates most closely to this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>perimeter</FONT></I>, referring more vaguely to the outer edges of something, especially as seen from within: a planet on the <I><FONT color=brown>periphery</FONT></I> of the camping area. Sometimes the word is seen as applying mainly to solid objects, but this is not always true. The word does have a more generalized use to suggest something that is far from the centre of things and thus of little importance: an official position that was on the <I><FONT color=brown>periphery</FONT></I> of the administration’s centre of power.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Circumference</FONT></B> refers to the <I><FONT color=brown>perimeter</FONT></I> of a circle, both to the line itself and to its total length. By extension, the word can refer to the bounding line of any curved shape, plane or solid: a hundred seats along the outside <I><FONT color=brown>circumference</FONT></I> of the amphiteatre; a barrel that was four feet at its widest <I><FONT color=brown>circumference</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Girth</FONT></B> refers specifically to the <I><FONT color=brown>circumference</FONT></I> of a curved solid, particularly the waist or belly of a person or animal: the <I><FONT color=brown>girth</FONT></I> of a red gum at its base: a portly man of astonishing <I><FONT color=brown>girth</FONT></I>; a strap too short for the girth of the horse. In relation to the last example, <I><FONT color=brown>girth</FONT></I> is applied also to the strap itself, which is fastened round the belly of an animal to secure a saddle or pack.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boundary">BOUNDARY</A>, <A href="entry://Circumscribe">CIRCUMSCRIBE</A>, <A href="entry://Edge">EDGE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Centre">CENTRE</A>.</P>

<P>These words can serve as arbitrary labels given to sequences of time. <B><FONT color=blue>Period</FONT></B> is the most general of these and <B><FONT color=blue>aeon</FONT></B> the least definite. <I><FONT color=brown>Period</FONT></I> can describe any passage of time, great or small: a rest <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I> of five minutes; the stormy <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I> of adolescence. In reference to history, the word can loosely characterize a sequence of time as a convenient aid to discussion, without claiming that such a sequence is homogeneous or self contained: the <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I> of artistic ferment between the two world wars. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>aeon</FONT></I> is used, often in the plural, to indicate an immeasurably long stretch of time. While otherwise vague in reference, it does explicitly reject any notion of uniformity in the <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I> alluded to: the <I><FONT color=brown>aeons</FONT></I> before man’s appearance on the planet; the <I><FONT color=brown>aeons</FONT></I> remaining before the sun’s extinction. <B><FONT color=blue>Cycle</FONT></B> is much more clear-cut at its most restricted, referring <I><FONT color=brown>cycle</FONT></I> of the sun takes a year, while one <I><FONT color=brown>cycle</FONT></I> of the moon, revealing all its phases, takes 28 days; the life <I><FONT color=brown>cycle</FONT></I> of the hookworm.] Sometimes, the word can refer to the recurring pattern itself: the business <I><FONT color=brown>cycle</FONT></I> and its alternation between the bull and bear markets.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Epoch</FONT></B>, most strictly, indicates an event of such significance that it can be said to usher in a new <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I> in history: The bombing of Hiroshima marked an <I><FONT color=brown>epoch</FONT></I> in man’s history. More often now, the word is used to refer indefinitely to a compact or self-contained <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I> in human history, one that is recognizable because in the New World. <B><FONT color=blue>Era</FONT></B> refers exclusively to such a self-contained <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I> of history, although the time span implied may be longer than that suggested by the extended use of <I><FONT color=brown>epoch</FONT></I>: Cubism, Abstractionism and Pop Art have all been <I><FONT color=brown>epochs</FONT></I> in the post-realistic <I><FONT color=brown>era</FONT></I>.</P><P>Generation refers to the period between the birth of the parents and the birth of their offspring, commonly calculated for human beings in Western countries as 30 years; the word may also refer to the offspring themselves: the first generation of Italians to be born in Australia. More pertinent here, generation has become a fad word for typifying any era, often shorter than 30 years, in which young people coming of age seem involved in a set of concerns or sociological behaviour that is more characteristic of them than of their parents: the Bodgie and Widgie generation of the post-war years; hippies who consider themselves members of the Love Generation. Often the word is used to make dramatic-sounding phrases without necessarily being apt for the members of the whole group so typified. It is widely if loosely used, also, to denote a group of young people at a particular period in time: the present generation of university students.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Age</FONT></B> might often suggest a longer lasting period than <I><FONT color=brown>epoch</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>era</FONT></I>, one that could be typified in terms of some dominant interest or person: the <I><FONT color=brown>Age</FONT></I> of Shakespeare; the Atomic <I><FONT color=brown>Age</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>Age</FONT></I> of Churchill. Some writers feel that age is preferable to <I><FONT color=brown>era</FONT></I> in such designations, since the former is factual in tone, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>era</FONT></I> can possibly sound pretentious or inflated.</P><P>In geology, palaeontology and archaeology, the terms <I><FONT color=brown>era</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>epoch</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>age</FONT></I> have been assigned arbitrary definitions. In palaeontology, the palaeozoic <I><FONT color=brown>era</FONT></I> is divided into the <I><FONT color=brown>age</FONT></I> of invertebrates, the <I><FONT color=brown>age</FONT></I> of fishes, and the <I><FONT color=brown>age</FONT></I> of amphibians. In geology, the palaeozoic <I><FONT color=brown>era</FONT></I> is divided into <I><FONT color=brown>periods</FONT></I>, such as the permian <I><FONT color=brown>period</FONT></I>, which is further subdivided into <I><FONT color=brown>epochs</FONT></I>, such as the Thuringian <I><FONT color=brown>Epoch</FONT></I>. In archaeology, the basic division is an <I><FONT color=brown>age</FONT></I>, determined by the predominant culture, as the Stone <I><FONT color=brown>Age</FONT></I>, the Bronze <I><FONT color=brown>Age</FONT></I> and the Iron <I><FONT color=brown>Age</FONT></I>. The Stone <I><FONT color=brown>Age</FONT></I> is subdivided into <I><FONT color=brown>periods</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>eras</FONT></I>, as the neolithic and palaeolithic <I><FONT color=brown>periods</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>eras</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Everlasting">EVERLASTING</A>, <A href="entry://Modern">MODERN</A>, OLD-FASHIONED.</P>

<P>These words characterize that which does not change, pass away or fade. <B><FONT color=blue>Permanent</FONT></B> is a broad word and means continuing in the same place or condition without change for a indefinitely long period of time: the <I><FONT color=brown>permanent</FONT></I> foundation of a building; the <I><FONT color=brown>permanent</FONT></I> effect of Latin on the English language; <I><FONT color=brown>permanent</FONT></I> damage to the spinal cord. <B><FONT color=blue>Lasting</FONT></B> is closely synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>permanent</FONT></I>, but is used to refer to something that may end sooner or later: a <I><FONT color=brown>lasting</FONT></I> friendship; the <I><FONT color=brown>lasting</FONT></I> effects of having been in combat. <B><FONT color=blue>Enduring</FONT></B> is a stronger word than either <I><FONT color=brown>permanent</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>lasting</FONT></I>, since it implies great resistance to both time and change: the <I><FONT color=brown>enduring</FONT></I> grandeur of Bach chorales; the <I><FONT color=brown>enduring</FONT></I> pyramids of Egypt. <B><FONT color=blue>Perpetual</FONT></B> is perhaps the strongest word in the entire group, and emphasizes the sense of continuing endlessly in time. It refers chiefly to an activity that is not susceptible to interruption: the <I><FONT color=brown>perpetual</FONT></I> flow of the river: a <I><FONT color=brown>perpetual</FONT></I> rain; her <I><FONT color=brown>perpetual</FONT></I> complaints. <B><FONT color=blue>Durable</FONT></B>, less closely related to the above words, describes that which is able to continue for a long time in the same state and has the power to resist change, decay and wear: <I><FONT color=brown>durable</FONT></I> woollen cloth; the <I><FONT color=brown>durable</FONT></I> granite of the cliff; the <I><FONT color=brown>durable</FONT></I> and indomitable spirit of the old gold prospector.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Perennial</FONT></B> differs from the other words in that it originally stipulated a set period of time ?the year. In one sense it has come to mean <I><FONT color=brown>lasting</FONT></I> for one year or recurring every year: <I><FONT color=brown>perennial</FONT></I> plants. Now, by extension, it means both <I><FONT color=brown>permanent</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>perpetual</FONT></I> in describing something that is unceasing and also impervious to change: the <I><FONT color=brown>perennial</FONT></I> rise and fall of the tides; the <I><FONT color=brown>perennial</FONT></I> ties between parents and children.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stable</FONT></B> applies to that which has a firmness of character or position so as to resist change or displacement: a <I><FONT color=brown>stable</FONT></I> currency; a <I><FONT color=brown>stable</FONT></I> economy. Alone in this group, <I><FONT color=brown>stable</FONT></I> is applied to human personality as marked by steadfastness of purpose, emotional balance and the ability to cope with stress: a nervous, excitable teacher not considered <I><FONT color=brown>stable</FONT></I> enough to continue with her work.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indelible</FONT></B> means <I><FONT color=brown>permanent</FONT></I> in the sense of not being easily erased or obliterated: <I><FONT color=brown>indelible</FONT></I> strawberry stains on a tablecloth; an old letter written in <I><FONT color=brown>indelible</FONT></I> ink; a scene of horror that left an <I><FONT color=brown>indelible</FONT></I> impression on his memory.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abiding</FONT></B> refers to that which ahs continued and will continue for a long time. It is applied mostly to feelings and abstract concepts <I><FONT color=brown>abiding</FONT></I> love; <I><FONT color=brown>abiding</FONT></I> truth. It is now found mostly in poetry and literature of the past, and is best replaced by <I><FONT color=brown>lasting</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>enduring</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Everlasting">EVERLASTING</A>, <A href="entry://Immortal">IMMORTAL</A>, <A href="entry://Immutable">IMMUTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Monotonous">MONOTONOUS</A>, <A href="entry://None">PERMANENT</A>, <A href="entry://Persistent">PERSISTENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: brief, short-lived, <A href="entry://Temporary">TEMPORARY</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>permeate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>imbue</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>impregnate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>penetrate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pervade</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>saturate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>supersaturate</FONT></B>:

<P>These verbs express the action of passing into and spreading through every part of something, like a liquid or a gas. <B><FONT color=blue>Permeate</FONT></B> focuses directly on this concept. It emphasizes both entry and diffusion, indicating infiltration through the very pores. It may be used in a physical sense: a waterproof fabric, treated with a substance that keeps water from <I><FONT color=brown>permeating</FONT></I> it; spring rains that <I><FONT color=brown>permeate</FONT></I> the earth. Or it may apply to a sense impression: Cooking odours <I><FONT color=brown>permeated</FONT></I> the air. It is especially expressive in purely figurative contexts, with reference to intangibles. [The atmosphere of England <I><FONT color=brown>permeates</FONT></I> the club; The spirit of his times <I><FONT color=brown>permeates</FONT></I> his writing; A sense of peace and contentment <I><FONT color=brown>permeated</FONT></I> the room, seeming to fill every nook and cranny.] <B><FONT color=blue>Penetrate</FONT></B> comes from a Latin verb meaning to put within. More strongly than <I><FONT color=brown>permeate</FONT></I>, it stresses the initial entry into something, and often implies the overcoming of resistance. [A powerful headlight beam was needed to <I><FONT color=brown>penetrate</FONT></I> the fog; Here no sound can <I><FONT color=brown>penetrate</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>Penetrating</FONT></I> cold went through his coat and chilled him to the bone; tissues that allow certain liquids to <I><FONT color=brown>penetrate</FONT></I> while preventing the passage of others.] <I><FONT color=brown>Penetrate</FONT></I> is also used of a figurative breakthrough, and may sometimes refer to a deep or lasting effect made on the mind or emotions: a psychiatrist using hypnosis to <I><FONT color=brown>penetrate</FONT></I> a patient’s amnesia; an attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>penetrate</FONT></I> the boy’s protective hostility.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pervade</FONT></B> comes from Latin roots meaning to go through; it marks a change in emphasis from entry to effect. Where <I><FONT color=brown>permeate</FONT></I> refers to an action like that of a gas which diffuses through all the pores or intermolecular spaces of a solid or another gas, <I><FONT color=brown>pervade</FONT></I> describes the action of a gas which fills all the open space of a chamber. Hence a gas <I><FONT color=brown>pervades</FONT></I> a room by <I><FONT color=brown>permeating</FONT></I> the air in the room. In extended senses, <I><FONT color=brown>pervade</FONT></I> is more closely synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>permeate</FONT></I>; it may be used throughout a thing. [The headmaster’s influence <I><FONT color=brown>pervades</FONT></I> the school; a strange stillness <I><FONT color=brown>pervaded</FONT></I> the garden, like the hush before a storm; In the eyes of the priest, God seemed to <I><FONT color=brown>pervade</FONT></I> all creation.] <B><FONT color=blue>Impregnate</FONT></B> goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>permeate</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>pervade</FONT></I>. It stresses the new qualities or characteristics gained by a substance through which some other substance has been diffused: air <I><FONT color=brown>impregnated</FONT></I> with poisonous gases. It is also used figuratively: Every page of his work is <I><FONT color=brown>impregnated</FONT></I> with his prejudices.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Saturate</FONT></B> comes from a Latin verb meaning to fill up, and <B><FONT color=blue>supersaturate</FONT></B> is an intensification of it. In chemistry, a solution is said to be <I><FONT color=brown>saturated</FONT></I> when the solvent can hold no more of the solute under existing conditions of temperature and pressure: water <I><FONT color=brown>saturated</FONT></I> with salt. A <I><FONT color=brown>supersaturated</FONT></I> solution is one carried beyond the normal degree of <I><FONT color=brown>saturation</FONT></I>, made to hold more solute by a mechanical process of heating and cooling. A slight jar or the addition of one more bit of solute to such a solution can suddenly produce crystals. When air becomes <I><FONT color=brown>saturated</FONT></I> with water vapour, having a relative humidity of 100%, the excess vapour begins to condense as dew; when <I><FONT color=brown>supersaturated</FONT></I>, the air contains an amount of moisture more than sufficient to <I><FONT color=brown>saturate</FONT></I> it, as in a fog. In general usage, <I><FONT color=brown>saturate</FONT></I> means to fill anything to the utmost extent of its capacity for absorbing or retaining. Going well beyond <I><FONT color=brown>permeate</FONT></I>, it often suggests a thorough soaking or a being thoroughly soaked. [Moisture <I><FONT color=brown>permeated</FONT></I> the wall, leaving it damp; Rain <I><FONT color=brown>saturated</FONT></I> their clothes, leaving them sodden; A swamp is land so <I><FONT color=brown>saturated</FONT></I> with water as to be unfit for tillage.] <I><FONT color=brown>Saturate</FONT></I> is also used figuratively. [His mind was <I><FONT color=brown>saturated</FONT></I> with facts after hours of studying for the exam; She <I><FONT color=brown>saturated</FONT></I> herself in the culture and customs of her adopted land.] <I><FONT color=brown>Supersaturate</FONT></I> also has extended uses, referring to more of anything than can be absorbed or accommodated: a <I><FONT color=brown>supersaturated</FONT></I> labour market.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Imbue</FONT></B> comes from a Latin verb meaning to wet, soak or dye. In a physical sense, it suggests the imparting of a colour that soaks in deeply and <I><FONT color=brown>saturates</FONT></I> the whole: The dye <I><FONT color=brown>permeated</FONT></I> the cloth, <I><FONT color=brown>imbuing</FONT></I> it with a rich red. In a figurative sense, it means to fill or <I><FONT color=brown>impregnate</FONT></I>, as with emotions, ideals or other intangible qualities. [She <I><FONT color=brown>imbued</FONT></I> her son with the principles for which his father fought; fighting men <I><FONT color=brown>imbued</FONT></I> with patriotism; a strangely sinister place, <I><FONT color=brown>imbued</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>saturated</FONT></I> with an atmosphere of evil.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impenetrable">IMPENETRABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Implant">IMPLANT</A>, <A href="entry://Pierce">PIERCE</A>, <A href="entry://Wet">WET</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>permit</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>allow</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>authorize</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>let</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the act of not preventing. <B><FONT color=blue>Permit</FONT></B>, allow and let are loosely related, <I><FONT color=brown>permit</FONT></I> being the strongest of the three. To <I><FONT color=brown>permit</FONT></I> is to grant leave to or empower by express consent; the word suggests authority that could prevent, if it so chose: The chairman recognized the delegate and <I><FONT color=brown>permitted</FONT></I> him to speak. <B><FONT color=blue>Allow</FONT></B>, used positively, means to grant as a right or privilege: a teenager <I><FONT color=brown>allowed</FONT></I> to stay out until midnight and <I><FONT color=brown>permitted</FONT></I> to use the family car on occasion. <I><FONT color=brown>Allow</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>permit</FONT></I> are often used interchangeably; <I><FONT color=brown>allow</FONT></I>, however, is a less formal term and often carries the idea of simply not attempting to hinder. <I><FONT color=brown>Permit</FONT></I>, by contrast, implies a greater or lesser degree of approval and may indicate official sanction. [The nurse <I><FONT color=brown>allowed</FONT></I> the visitors to remain beyond the hospital visiting hours, though it was not <I><FONT color=brown>permitted</FONT></I>.] <B><FONT color=blue>Let</FONT></B>, the least formal of these words, may sometimes suggest permission or consent, but may imply no more than a failure to prevent or restrain. [She asked her boss to <I><FONT color=brown>let</FONT></I> her leave an hour early; Don’t interrupt him ?<I><FONT color=brown>let</FONT></I> him speak his piece.] A person may <I><FONT color=brown>let</FONT></I> things happen passively, either through choice or through indifference, carelessness, error or inattention. [She decided to <I><FONT color=brown>let</FONT></I> her hair grow; He <I><FONT color=brown>let</FONT></I> his insurance policy lapse; They forgot to shut the windows and thereby <I><FONT color=brown>let</FONT></I> the rain in.] As opposed to <I><FONT color=brown>permit</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>let</FONT></I> may point up a lack of, or failure to exercise, preventive authority: a timid, unassertive little man, always <I><FONT color=brown>letting</FONT></I> people take advantage of him.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Authorize</FONT></B> is stronger and more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>permit</FONT></I> and is more limited in application. It implies positive approval of a proposed course of action by an authority empowered either to <I><FONT color=brown>permit</FONT></I> or to forbid it. [The government <I><FONT color=brown>authorized</FONT></I> the construction of a new expressway; The firm <I><FONT color=brown>authorized</FONT></I> the use of a company car by the salesman after working hours.] <I><FONT color=brown>Authorize</FONT></I> may further imply the delegation of authority: a U.N. delegate authorized by his government to conduct formal negotiations.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Endorse">ENDORSE</A>, <A href="entry://Lenient">LENIENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: enjoin, forbid, interdict, prevent, prohibit.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>claim</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>perquisite</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>right</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>title</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are concerned with establishing ownership or possession of land, money or other valuables. A <B><FONT color=blue>claim</FONT></B> may be an actual document that permits one to possess land formerly in the public domain ?or it may be the land itself: a <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I> of only a few acres that seemed worthless until gold was discovered near by. In a more general sense, a <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I> may be an assertion of one’s legal or moral entitlement to something that is held, withheld or owed to one by another: the drama coach who made a <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I> on the estate of the deceased actress; the Negro’s <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I> to full equality; an injured workman’s <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I> to compensation. <B><FONT color=blue>Title</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I>, may also refer to an actual document that gives one possession of land or real estate. But unlike a <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I> that one may earn or come to possess by following a certain set of procedures, a <I><FONT color=brown>title</FONT></I> cannot usually be had except by purchase or inheritance. [The prospector staked, then filed, his <I><FONT color=brown>claim</FONT></I>; Her uncle’s will gave her <I><FONT color=brown>title</FONT></I> to the house.]</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>perquisite</FONT></B>, colloquially a "<B><FONT color=blue>perk</FONT></B>," is now more often called a "fringe benefit." In any case, it is something that accrues to one as an added advantage of one’s usual job or position: <I><FONT color=brown>perquisites</FONT></I> that included free room and board. It may suggest a monetary consideration in the form of a tip or bonus; and it may be specified in writing or may be simply an unwritten understanding between employer and employee.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>right</FONT></B> is the most general of these terms and might substitute for any of them. In its narrowest sense, it may imply a legal proof of ownership, or a contractual agreement that has been put into writing. In is larger sense, it may refer to those things to which someone feels entitled without actually possessing them; such a <I><FONT color=brown>right</FONT></I> may be a moral, ethical, emotional or tactical one: a <I><FONT color=brown>right</FONT></I> to ten per cent of all proceeds from the book’s sales; a child’s <I><FONT color=brown>right</FONT></I> to love and understanding; the inalienable <I><FONT color=brown>right</FONT></I> of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Right">RIGHT</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to something that goes on existing. <B><FONT color=blue>Persist</FONT></B> at its mildest can indicate the lingering on of something beyond the point where one would expect it to terminate: A dwindling hope of restoring the monarchy persisted in France even into this century. At its most forceful, the word suggests a tenacious will to exist, as in a hardy or stubborn struggle against odds: a species that persisted despite the coming of floods, glaciers, famine and plague. Less favourably, the word can indicate an annoying or obstinate insistence that goes on without pause. [He <I><FONT color=brown>persisted</FONT></I> in quibbling about fine points in the contract long after everyone else was satisfied; Why must you <I><FONT color=brown>persist</FONT></I> in bothering us with demands for money?]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Continue</FONT></B> is much more general than <I><FONT color=brown>persist</FONT></I>; it is also less definite, since its neutrality is uncoloured by implications of any sort. The word refers to any on-going process after its start and before its conclusion: an announcement that the bombings would <I><FONT color=brown>continue</FONT></I>; the hope that he would be able to <I><FONT color=brown>continue</FONT></I> at school; The riot <I><FONT color=brown>continued</FONT></I> to rage out of control for another day. Sometimes, the word can specifically point to a resumption after a halt: Please <I><FONT color=brown>continue</FONT></I> with what you were doing before I came in. <B><FONT color=blue>Last</FONT></B> refers specifically to something that <I><FONT color=brown>continues</FONT></I> to exist, particularly when this is not necessarily inevitable: the few masterpieces from each age that will last for centuries. At its most literal, the word can refer to remaining viable or alive, or it can be used in connection with measuring duration: perfume with a scent that <I><FONT color=brown>lasts</FONT></I> a long time; He lasted out the fever but succumbed to a minor infection; an avant-garde film that <I><FONT color=brown>lasts</FONT></I> eight hours.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Endure</FONT></B> can be used as a more formal substitute for last: a body of poetry that will <I><FONT color=brown>endure</FONT></I>. The word has richer associations when it becomes transitive; in this case, it suggests the same dauntless struggle for existence against odds that <I><FONT color=brown>persist</FONT></I> can refer to, but here no possibly interfering negative overtones of obstinance obtrude, since <I><FONT color=brown>endure</FONT></I> is almost wholly favourable in tone: a patriot willing to <I><FONT color=brown>endure</FONT></I> torture and even death to defend his country; the traditional siesta that helped us to <I><FONT color=brown>endure</FONT></I> the broiling summer days of the tropics. Intransitively, <B><FONT color=blue>survive</FONT></B> indicates continued existence: Somehow, we <I><FONT color=brown>survive</FONT></I>. Often, the word implies the successful overcoming of an ordeal or threat to existence: Of those wounded in the battle, only three <I><FONT color=brown>survived</FONT></I>. Transitively, <I><FONT color=brown>survive</FONT></I> compares with <I><FONT color=brown>endure</FONT></I>, except that the latter suggests a strength and permanence that can overcome obstacles intact, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>survive</FONT></I> is open to the implication of greater frailty or subsequent impairment: Although many died or <I><FONT color=brown>survived</FONT></I> only as physical or mental wrecks, a few of the hardiest explorers were able to <I><FONT color=brown>endure</FONT></I> every punishment the untracked jungles could offer them.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Weather</FONT></B> is restricted to a transitive sense that points to the <I><FONT color=brown>surviving</FONT></I> of crises or exposures to danger. The word may apply to <I><FONT color=brown>lasting</FONT></I> out difficulty without change or impairment, but more often the word does suggest an altered state, though this may often be one of increased maturity or mellowness: She <I><FONT color=brown>weathered</FONT></I> every conflict in their marriage without the slightest difficulty; an increased sense of self-confidence among university students who successfully weather the trials and tribulations of their first year; people who <I><FONT color=brown>weather</FONT></I> a first heart attack with only slight impairment.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Exist">EXIST</A>, MATURE (v.), <A href="entry://Remain">REMAIN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: collapse, <A href="entry://Die">DIE</A>, fade, fail, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A> (cease).</P>

<P>These words refer to what continues or is repeated without pause. <B><FONT color=blue>Persistent</FONT></B> can indicate an unflagging series of efforts, favourably implying determination or unfavourably implying a meddlesome attitude: his <I><FONT color=brown>persistent</FONT></I> efforts to better himself from his first job as a clerk to his later work as a barrister; annoyed by the stranger’s <I><FONT color=brown>persistent</FONT></I> questions. The word is very general, however, since it can apply also to anything of long duration or to any series of repetitions: finally awakened by the <I><FONT color=brown>persistent</FONT></I> ringing of the alarm clock; the <I><FONT color=brown>persistent</FONT></I> brushing of leaves against our bedroom windows.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Continuous</FONT></B> refers exclusively to something that is unbroken throughout its entire length, great or small, whether its extension is through time or space: a <I><FONT color=brown>continuous</FONT></I> expanse of wall without door or window; a <I><FONT color=brown>continuous</FONT></I> hum in one of his hi-fi speakers. <B><FONT color=blue>Continual</FONT></B>, by contrast, pertains exclusively to something that, despite short or great intervals of rest, is repeated over a long period of time: the <I><FONT color=brown>continual</FONT></I> coming and going of trains in the marshalling yard; a <I><FONT color=brown>continual</FONT></I> pounding at his door; the <I><FONT color=brown>continual</FONT></I> bickering of her parents.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unremitting</FONT></B> is an intensification of persistent in both the latter’s positive and negative uses. When favourable, <I><FONT color=brown>unremitting</FONT></I> can indicate earnest dedication, suggesting an undaunted or relentless series of efforts or attempts: Robert the Bruce watched as the spider tried again and again with <I><FONT color=brown>unremitting</FONT></I> patience to weave its web. When infavourable, the word suggests inflexibility or stubbornness; in this case, it can function more like <I><FONT color=brown>continuous</FONT></I>, since it suggests an unalterable or unbroken extension of something through time: an <I><FONT color=brown>unremitting</FONT></I> hatred that had not dimmed in intensity over the years.</P><P>The remaining words are all drawn from the same root meaning to delay and could thus be understood as indicating something that continues without break. While all three words can be used in this way, <B><FONT color=blue>incessant</FONT></B> is now often used particularly for anything that occurs in quick repetitions over a long time span: the <I><FONT color=brown>incessant</FONT></I> crashing of waves against the rocks. <I><FONT color=brown>Incessant</FONT></I> can also apply forcefully to annoying or meddlesome repetitions: <I><FONT color=brown>incessant</FONT></I> phone calls from the debt collector; the <I><FONT color=brown>incessant</FONT></I> whining and complaining of the little boy. <B><FONT color=blue>Ceaseless</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unceasing</FONT></B> are close, but <I><FONT color=brown>ceaseless</FONT></I> might be the word of choice for uninterrupted action, <I><FONT color=brown>unceasing</FONT></I> for unchanging attitudes: her <I><FONT color=brown>ceaseless</FONT></I> vigil by the sick-bed; the loud and <I><FONT color=brown>ceaseless</FONT></I> playing of his radiogram; <I><FONT color=brown>unceasing</FONT></I> devotion. <I><FONT color=brown>Ceaseless</FONT></I>, thus, can be a more emphatic substitute for continuous in its temporal application, while <I><FONT color=brown>unceasing</FONT></I> can be a milder substitute for the favourable sense of <I><FONT color=brown>unremitting</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Everlasting">EVERLASTING</A>, <A href="entry://Inexorable">INEXORABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Invariable">INVARIABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Monotonous">MONOTONOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>, <A href="entry://Stubborn">STUBBORN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Occasional">OCCASIONAL</A>, periodic, <A href="entry://Temporary">TEMPORARY</A>.</P>

It can refer also to the body: <I><FONT color=brown>physical</FONT></I> beauty; a <I><FONT color=brown>physical</FONT></I> defect. Or it can distinguish the body from the mind: tests to determine whether the heart pains were <I><FONT color=brown>physical</FONT></I> or psychological in origin. In dualistic philosophy, the word contrasts with spiritual: rejecting <I><FONT color=brown>physical</FONT></I> attachments for enduring spiritual values. Most concretely, if somewhat euphemistically, the word can refer to sexuality: <I><FONT color=brown>physical</FONT></I> love.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Corporeal</FONT></B> more clearly contrasts with the spiritual or immaterial than physical: positing a spiritual basis underlying all <I><FONT color=brown>corporeal</FONT></I> things. It can also refer to anything organized into an entity: the <I><FONT color=brown>corporeal</FONT></I> law. <B><FONT color=blue>Material</FONT></B> is a less scholarly sounding term than <I><FONT color=brown>corporeal</FONT></I> in its reference to matter or to physical objects: the <I><FONT color=brown>material</FONT></I> universe; his <I><FONT color=brown>material</FONT></I> possessions. The word is often used to distinguish object-oriented values from more idealistic ones: the <I><FONT color=brown>material</FONT></I> greed fostered by advertising. <I><FONT color=brown>Corporal</FONT></I> now refers exclusively to the body, intensifying the negative possibilities of <I><FONT color=brown>physical</FONT></I> in this sense by emphasizing most often what is applied to or inflicted on the body: <I><FONT color=brown>corporal</FONT></I> punishment. Beyond this stock phrase, in fact, the word is less often used than the more direct <B><FONT color=blue>bodily</FONT></B>. The latter can be neutral in itself: or it can be opposed to the mental or spiritual: <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I> sensations carried to the brain; those <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I> appetites that are considered sinful. Related to the last possibility, <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I> can refer specifically to sensual or sexual pleasures, possibility, <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I> can refer specifically to sensual or sexual pleasure, possibly in disapproving way, although this use may now sound old-fashioned: <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I> desire.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fleshly</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>carnal</FONT></B> both concentrate on this last implication of <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>fleshly</FONT></I> appearing in a religious context and <I><FONT color=brown>carnal</FONT></I> most often in legal terminology. <I><FONT color=brown>Fleshly</FONT></I> can sound even more old-fashioned than <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>fleshly</FONT></I> dissipations. One use of <I><FONT color=brown>carnal</FONT></I> is so familiar as to have reduced its use in other ways; this refers specifically to sexual intercourse in the phrase "carnal knowledge." Where it once could refer simply to sensual or <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I> appetite, this now might be misunderstood as explicitly indicating the sexual: a <I><FONT color=brown>carnal</FONT></I> licentiousness that characterized Venetian society. <B><FONT color=blue>Fleshy</FONT></B> is useful as a neutral designation for soft <I><FONT color=brown>bodily</FONT></I> tissue as opposed to bone and sinew: wounded in the <I><FONT color=brown>fleshy</FONT></I> part of his upper arm. The word can even refer to flabby muscle or fat tissues: his torso having grown noticeably <I><FONT color=brown>fleshy</FONT></I> over the years. Although much more formal and technical, <B><FONT color=blue>mesomorphic</FONT></B> relates to <I><FONT color=brown>fleshy</FONT></I> in referring to a body in which muscular tissue has been favoured by development over nervous and digestive tissue: neurasthenic, pyknic and <I><FONT color=brown>mesomorphic</FONT></I> body types. More loosely, as a fad word, <I><FONT color=brown>mesomorphic</FONT></I> can refer merely to a substantially developed muscularity: a do-or-die <I><FONT color=brown>mesomorphic</FONT></I> platoon sergeant.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: mental, spiritual.</P>

<P>These words indicate the forcing of a sharp, pointed instrument into something by means of a driving or cutting action. <B><FONT color=blue>Pierce</FONT></B> may suggest merely the cutting of any opening into something, though more often it is used to indicate the cutting of a hole entirely through a thin layer to its other side: a screen <I><FONT color=brown>pierced</FONT></I> to let light through; <I><FONT color=brown>piercing</FONT></I> a balloon; a hat <I><FONT color=brown>pierced</FONT></I> by a hatpin; instruments with which to <I><FONT color=brown>pierce</FONT></I> ears. By implication, the opening through the layer is made by a sharp, thin object such as a needle or lance. <B><FONT color=blue>Stab</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests that something is merely cut into, not <I><FONT color=brown>pierced</FONT></I>; furthermore, <I><FONT color=brown>stab</FONT></I> suggests the use of a bladed instrument such a sword or knife rather than something needlelike, as with <I><FONT color=brown>pierce</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>stabbing</FONT></I> the man with his dagger. <B><FONT color=blue>Prick</FONT></B> is <I><FONT color=brown>more</FONT></I> nearly comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>pierce</FONT></I>, but specifically may suggest a light, glancing thrust of a needlelike instrument to make a small opening in or through a thin layer: <I><FONT color=brown>pricking</FONT></I> the blister with a heated needle; thorns that <I><FONT color=brown>pricked</FONT></I> his skin as he ran.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Penetrate</FONT></B> is more formal and more general than the foregoing. It may suggest the partial or complete passage made by any sort of instrument: measuring the depth to which the bullet had <I><FONT color=brown>penetrated</FONT></I> the flesh; a façade of marble <I><FONT color=brown>penetrated</FONT></I> by three rows of windows. The word may also suggest the achieving of any sort of entrance into or through something, whether along an existing passageway, through a discontinuous mass, or through a permeable membrane; in these cases, the act may by implication be difficult but it may be achieved without altering or actually <I><FONT color=brown>piercing</FONT></I> the medium itself: brave explorers who first <I><FONT color=brown>penetrated</FONT></I> the jungles of Africa; light that <I><FONT color=brown>penetrated</FONT></I> the dusty windows. <B><FONT color=blue>Probe</FONT></B> suggests a deliberate, cautious or exploratory attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>penetrate</FONT></I> something; the passage may already exist or may be made by the act of proving: carefully <I><FONT color=brown>probing</FONT></I> the cavity with a toothpick; two men sent in to <I><FONT color=brown>probe</FONT></I> the tunnels for possible survivors.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cut">CUT</A>, <A href="entry://Hew">HEW</A>, <A href="entry://Permeate">PERMEATE</A>, <A href="entry://Wound">WOUND</A>.</P>

<P>These words denote a domestic mamma whose flesh, called pork, is used as food in most countries of the world. <B><FONT color=blue>Pig</FONT></B> is the most general term: to raise <I><FONT color=brown>pigs</FONT></I> for the market. A small pig, weighing up to 130 pounds live weight, is called a pork <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I>, and one between 130 and 240 pounds live weight a bacon <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I>. Other terms exist for <I><FONT color=brown>pigs</FONT></I> weighing more than 240 pounds (such as backfatter), but these are confined mostly to farmers and other engaged in the meat industry. <B><FONT color=blue>Hog</FONT></B> is a common synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I> in the United States, where it refers specifically to an animal weighing more than 120 pounds. The word is not used in a commercial sense in Australia or New Zealand, but because of the association of both <I><FONT color=brown>hog</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I> with a voracious appetite, both words are commonly used to describe a greedy or gluttonous person. <I><FONT color=brown>Hog</FONT></I> is a more abusive term than <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I>, which is often intended half-humorously. The term road-<I><FONT color=brown>hog</FONT></I> also illustrates the pejorative use of the word.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Swine</FONT></B>, which is also a collective noun, has been largely supplanted by <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>hog</FONT></I> and now has a somewhat literary sound: Circe, who turned men into <I><FONT color=brown>swine</FONT></I>; a courtesan of kings, who tended <I><FONT color=brown>swine</FONT></I> as a child. <I><FONT color=brown>Swine</FONT></I> is still applied to a person and is more insulting than either <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>hog</FONT></I> because it implies not only greed but viciousness and depravity.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>boar</FONT></B> is an uncastrated male pig of any domestic breed. It applies also to a wild <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I> of either sex which is hunted for sport in Australia, new Zealand, continental Europe, southern Asia, North Africa and formerly in England. <B><FONT color=blue>Sow</FONT></B> is the correct term for a female domesticated <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I> used for breeding. Figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>sow</FONT></I> is used contemptuously to describe a fat coarse, slovenly woman.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Porker</FONT></B> is applied to a <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>hog</FONT></I> that is being fattened for slaughter. A <B><FONT color=blue>sucking-pig</FONT></B> is the same but is much younger and is considered a great delicacy. <I><FONT color=brown>Porker</FONT></I> is also a humorous term for any <I><FONT color=brown>pig</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>hog</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Animal">ANIMAL</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>pile</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>agglomeration</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>heap</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mass</FONT></B>:

<P>These words denote the result of processes through which things or particles are gathered together. <B><FONT color=blue>Pile</FONT></B> suggests that the things which are gathered were brought together, usually by a person, rather than accumulated by chance or natural processes. It further suggests that the accumulated things were placed in some sort of order, one on top of the others, for example, or in layers. Finally, the things in a <I><FONT color=brown>pile</FONT></I>, such as the blocks in a <I><FONT color=brown>pile</FONT></I> of building blocks, are usually all of the same kind and, more than likely, of about the same size and shape.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Heap</FONT></B> implies a more casual gathering of things than pile. The things, which eventually take the form of a mound, are thrown together carelessly or haphazardly, and there is usually no evidence in a <I><FONT color=brown>heap</FONT></I> of selection or special arrangement: a <I><FONT color=brown>heap</FONT></I> of old clothes in the attic. <B><FONT color=blue>Agglomeration</FONT></B>, even more than <I><FONT color=brown>heap</FONT></I>, suggests a chance coming together of its parts, those parts being heterogeneous and not compacted, connected or consistent: a room that was an <I><FONT color=brown>agglomeration</FONT></I> of so many different styles of decorating that it seemed more the work of an eccentric than of an eclectic.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>mass</FONT></B> is an assemblage of things that, together, make up a single body. There is in this word a definite indication of adherence or coherence of the individual parts or objects and a suggestion that the final accumulated mass has no definite shape but is relatively large in size: a <I><FONT color=brown>mass</FONT></I> of clay; a <I><FONT color=brown>mass</FONT></I> of flowers.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accumulation">ACCUMULATION</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>playful</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>frisky</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>frolicsome</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sportive</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to an inclination to take part in pleasurable activity. <B><FONT color=blue>Playful</FONT></B> is the most general of these words and the most neutral in indicating any mood of levity that does not directly contribute to the accomplishing of essential or practical tasks: distracted from her sewing by the <I><FONT color=brown>playful</FONT></I> kitten who wanted to chase reels of cotton round the room; husbands who expect to return at night to well-kept homes and to lively and <I><FONT color=brown>playful</FONT></I> children.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Frolicsome</FONT></B> is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>playful</FONT></I> in that it suggests the positive presence of exuberant high spirits that make one wish to undertake madcap or zany adventures of an unplanned spur-of-the-moment sort: a group of <I><FONT color=brown>frolicsome</FONT></I> youngsters who decided to drive to the beach at four in the morning. The carefree overtone of <I><FONT color=brown>playful</FONT></I> is intensified here: <I><FONT color=brown>frolicsome</FONT></I> puppies in a corner of the garden.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Frisky</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>frolicsome</FONT></I>, also pertains to exuberant high spirits, but stresses as well an extremely active physical energy that may be nervous, impatient, headlong and irrepressible: three or four <I><FONT color=brown>frisky</FONT></I> colts cantering about the pasture; a first round of drinks that made him feel <I><FONT color=brown>frisky</FONT></I> and insouciant. The word is even more pertinent to sexual adventurousness than any of the others, but may stress, more informally in this case, lusty impatience rather than good-humoured desire: giving her boyfriend a slap whenever he became too <I><FONT color=brown>frisky</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Sportive</FONT></B> may suggest an inclination to merrymaking in almost as neutral a way as <I><FONT color=brown>playful</FONT></I>, though it is considerably more formal than these other words: coffee-shops that are gathering places for <I><FONT color=brown>sportive</FONT></I> teenagers. The word may also refer specifically to an interest in games or sports: taking down his golf clubs every spring when the weather makes him feel <I><FONT color=brown>sportive</FONT></I>. More often, the word refers to a sexual interest although it need not suggest either the levity inherent in frolicsome or the impatience possible for frisky: parties where <I><FONT color=brown>sportive</FONT></I> career girls can meet unattached males on the make.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>, <A href="entry://Mischievous">MISCHIEVOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Listless">LISTLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Sedate">SEDATE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>plaything</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>game</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>novelty</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>toy</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to things designed or used for amusement. <B><FONT color=blue>Plaything</FONT></B> serves as a generic term covering the whole range of objects so used; most typically it appears in the plural to indicate objects pertaining to children’s recreation: insisting that he put all his <I><FONT color=brown>playthings</FONT></I> away each night before bedtime. In the singular, <I><FONT color=brown>plaything</FONT></I> may function more specifically to suggest the ephemeral nature or triviality of an object; these implications come to the fore especially when the word is used in reference to adults. Here, <I><FONT color=brown>plaything</FONT></I> may indicate an object of idle amusement ?or even a person who is subject to someone else’s whims or serves as a source of merely sexual gratification: executives who can afford expensive sets of golf clubs and other idle <I><FONT color=brown>playthings</FONT></I>; treating his mistress as a <I><FONT color=brown>plaything</FONT></I> that need not be taken seriously.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Toy</FONT></B> is more restricted in reference to the <I><FONT color=brown>playthings</FONT></I> of a child. While this word can also be generic in its inclusiveness, it may suggest, particularly in the singular, a small but more complicated structure that often has moving parts and involves the child in a passive response: a <I><FONT color=brown>toy</FONT></I> that is wound up and then runs across the floor with a comical, jerking movement. In comparison, <I><FONT color=brown>plaything</FONT></I> may suggest something that is improvised or used merely as the equipment with which to carry on some more comprehensive play activity.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Game</FONT></B> at its most inclusive can refer to play in which no toys or <I><FONT color=brown>playthings</FONT></I> are used whatever. In reference to objects, however, the word can refer to the set of equipment necessary to a specific kind of play; in this sense, <I><FONT color=brown>game</FONT></I> might refer to a group of objects such as a playing board, dice, packs of cards, and counters: not sure whether Monopoly, chess or draughts would be the best game to give him as a gift. Obviously the word is not restricted to the recreation of children: roulette and other games of chance. Recently, the word has become a fad word to refer pejoratively to typical behaviour patterns that people mechanically act out without thinking: the invidious <I><FONT color=brown>game</FONT></I> of keeping up with the Joneses; Stop playing your he-man <I><FONT color=brown>games</FONT></I> with me. <B><FONT color=blue>Novelty</FONT></B> is the one word here that need not primarily suggest an amusement for children. The word can in fact refer to <I><FONT color=brown>playthings</FONT></I> designed especially for adults, in which case it may be apologetically euphemistic, as though adults might be embarrassed to think of recreational devices as being simply adult <I><FONT color=brown>toys</FONT></I>. Usually the word suggests an item that facilitates some sort of cheating or trick, some practical joke, or something that is trivial or off-colour: <I><FONT color=brown>novelties</FONT></I> such as dribble glasses, magic tricks, false ears and exploding cigars.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Child">CHILD</A>, <A href="entry://Childish">CHILDISH</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a humble, deferential, urgent or formal request for help. <B><FONT color=blue>Plead</FONT></B> may suggest a dignified humility, but in any case it stresses urgency: <I><FONT color=brown>pleading</FONT></I> for another chance. Even in legal uses, where it is now formalistic for any request or for a stating of position, as in <I><FONT color=brown>pleading</FONT></I> guilty. <B><FONT color=blue>Beg</FONT></B> is much more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>plead</FONT></I> and is devoid of legal application. Furthermore, it may join to the urgency implicit in plead a note not so much of humility as of abjectness: <I><FONT color=brown>begging</FONT></I> them at least to spare the lives of his children. In less extreme uses a sense of debasement may still be present, suggesting an insistent, continual harrying of someone who is in a position to grant a favour: begging hopelessly for another date; <I><FONT color=brown>begging</FONT></I> to be allowed to go outside and play.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Appeal</FONT></B> may not always suggest as great an urgency as <I><FONT color=brown>plead</FONT></I>, but it suggests an even greater dignity, implying a request based on reference to moral imperatives: <I><FONT color=brown>appealing</FONT></I> to the crowd’s sense of fair play. Legally, it suggests a request, in the name of justice, the one’s objection be sustained or that a decision against one be reversed <I><FONT color=brown>appealing</FONT></I> to the judge for a ruling; <I><FONT color=brown>appealing</FONT></I> to a higher court. <B><FONT color=blue>Beseech</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>entreat</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>implore</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pray</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>supplicate</FONT></B> are nearly synonymous terms which have great emotional power and suggest a very earnest <I><FONT color=brown>appeal</FONT></I> for aid. Usually the person or body <I><FONT color=brown>appealed</FONT></I> to has power to grant the request as a kind of indulgence without having to make major concessions. All may appear in widely differing contexts, although pray and supplicate would be used more in a religious sense: to <I><FONT color=brown>pray</FONT></I> for rescue; to <I><FONT color=brown>supplicate</FONT></I> the protection of the Almighty. <I><FONT color=brown>Entreat</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>beseech</FONT></I> are similar in meaning to beg but are much more formal; entreat carries the notion of persistence while <I><FONT color=brown>beseech</FONT></I> has a sense of greater desperation: He <I><FONT color=brown>entreated</FONT></I> them to make another effort; I <I><FONT color=brown>beseech</FONT></I> you for one more chance. <B><FONT color=blue>Implore</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>beseech</FONT></I> but has not quite the same formality or archaic flavour and would be more commonly used for a desperate <I><FONT color=brown>appeal</FONT></I>: I <I><FONT color=brown>implore</FONT></I> your forgiveness. All these words are used hyperbolically when <I><FONT color=brown>appeal</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>beg</FONT></I> or even ask would be quite fitting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sue</FONT></B> is seldom used intransitively in the legal sense and is extremely formal to the point to stuffiness in more ordinary contexts, except in some set phrases: <I><FONT color=brown>sue</FONT></I> for damages.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Demand">DEMAND</A>, <A href="entry://Request">REQUEST</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: command, <A href="entry://Demand">DEMAND</A>.</P>

<P>These words are used to refer to anything that the user finds interesting and satisfying. They are, as a group, words that are associated with mild pleasures and comforts rather than with intense feelings or passionate commitments. <B><FONT color=blue>Pleasing</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pleasant</FONT></B> are, with one exception, the mildest of these words, referring to one’s positive response to a setting, person, idea or thing. The response, however, is not so deep that one would be unable to turn away without regret. <I><FONT color=brown>Pleasant</FONT></I> suggests something that is naturally appealing because of its cheerful exterior or warm disposition. <I><FONT color=brown>Pleasing</FONT></I> may suggest, beyond this implication, a conscious attempt to please: a <I><FONT color=brown>pleasant</FONT></I> view of the harbour; a <I><FONT color=brown>pleasing</FONT></I> waitress. When <I><FONT color=brown>pleasing</FONT></I> does not refer to such a conscious attempt, it is nevertheless slightly stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>pleasant</FONT></I> in suggesting something more able to hold the attention or more satisfying. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>pleasant</FONT></I> may refer more to mood, and <I><FONT color=brown>pleasing</FONT></I> to comeliness: a <I><FONT color=brown>pleasing</FONT></I> figure; a <I><FONT color=brown>pleasant</FONT></I> smile. <B><FONT color=blue>Nice</FONT></B> is milder than either of the foregoing and can, of cause, refer to any kind of positive response whatsoever. Having no connotations of its own, it is susceptible to any implications context may give it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agreeable</FONT></B>, where it goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>pleasing</FONT></I>, suggests something especially in harmony with the wishes of the beholder: an <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> afternoon chatting with friends; an <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> city for an art lover to be stranded in. <B><FONT color=blue>Attractive</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>engaging</FONT></B> are stronger than either <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>pleasing</FONT></I> in suggesting something that draws or holds one’s attention. <I><FONT color=brown>Attractive</FONT></I> stresses comeliness that draws attention; <I><FONT color=brown>engaging</FONT></I> suggests liveliness or some other appeal that makes it difficult to turn away from: a woman who chose her clothes to set off her <I><FONT color=brown>attractive</FONT></I> figure; valued at parties because he was such an <I><FONT color=brown>engaging</FONT></I> conversationalist.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Enjoyable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>gratifying</FONT></B> stress actual satisfaction rather than the ability to draw or hold attention. <I><FONT color=brown>Enjoyable</FONT></I> is of a mildness comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>pleasing</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>gratifying</FONT></I> suggests a greater intensity of pleasure than any other word here. [The musical comedy sounded <I><FONT color=brown>attractive</FONT></I> enough to make us risk a visit, but while some of the numbers were <I><FONT color=brown>enjoyable</FONT></I> and a few of them actually <I><FONT color=brown>engaging</FONT></I>, the whole evening was far from <I><FONT color=brown>gratifying</FONT></I>.] The special force of <I><FONT color=brown>gratifying</FONT></I> lies in its suggestion that something has answered a deeper expectation or need; in this sense the word is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I>; a truly <I><FONT color=brown>gratifying</FONT></I> friendship based on many long, <I><FONT color=brown>agreeable</FONT></I> talks.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Charming">CHARMING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bad">BAD</A>, displeasing, <A href="entry://Obnoxious">OBNOXIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Repulsive">REPULSIVE</A>, unattractive, ungratifying.</P>

<P>These words all denote feelings of satisfaction or happiness. <B><FONT color=blue>Pleasure</FONT></B> is the most general term in the group. In its mildest sense, <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> may be only an expression of politeness, or it may convey the more absence of discomfort. [I have the <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> of presenting our opening speaker; the patient rallied and was able to take some <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> in his surroundings.] <I><FONT color=brown>Pleasure</FONT></I> may arise from a stimulation of the mind or the senses: the <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> to be found in books; the <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> of watching a spectacular sunset. In its strongest sense, <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> emphasizes gratification of the senses, or it may refer to a round of futile and frivolous amusements that exclude meaningful activity. In this meaning <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> may have a pejorative implication: the <I><FONT color=brown>pleasures</FONT></I> of the flesh; a rich young man who passed all his time in the relentless pursuit of <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Delight</FONT></B> may be a strong feeling of <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I>, but it is likely to be sudden and transient: <I><FONT color=brown>delighted</FONT></I> cries of children on Christmas morning; to take <I><FONT color=brown>delight</FONT></I> in winning a chess match. <I><FONT color=brown>Delight</FONT></I> may also refer to that in which one takes quiet <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> over a long span of time: the <I><FONT color=brown>delights</FONT></I> of spending one’s childhood on a farm.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ecstasy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rapture</FONT></B> denote intense or extreme exaltation, originally that accompanying religious or creative experience, but currently that of intense <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>delight</FONT></I>. From earlier usage, <I><FONT color=brown>ecstasy</FONT></I> connotes a trance-like state wherein one "stands beside himself," conscious of neither surroundings nor self, but only of what one contemplates or feels: the <I><FONT color=brown>ecstasy</FONT></I> of a saint during a mystical experience. <I><FONT color=brown>Ecstasy</FONT></I> still implies such intensity of feeling that other perceptions are clouded over: the <I><FONT color=brown>ecstasy</FONT></I> of first love. <I><FONT color=brown>Rapture</FONT></I>, in its original sense, connotes being seized or lifted up, as by divine power. It is now closely related in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>ecstasy</FONT></I>. Both words are commonly used hyperbolically to describe almost any degree of <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> or excitement: in a state of <I><FONT color=brown>ecstasy</FONT></I> at having won a scholarship; a child <I><FONT color=brown>ecstatic</FONT></I> over a new puppy.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Joy</FONT></B> is sometimes used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>delight</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>ecstasy</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>rapture</FONT></I>, but it implies greater intensity than does <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I>, longer duration than does <I><FONT color=brown>delight</FONT></I>, and is seldom so intense an experience as <I><FONT color=brown>rapture</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>ecstasy</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>joy</FONT></I> of watching the signs of returning spring after a hard winter; the <I><FONT color=brown>joys</FONT></I> of living in a warm, affectionate family setting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Enjoyment</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>delectation</FONT></B> may be used as mild synonyms for <I><FONT color=brown>delight</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>joy</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I>, but both these words denote action accompanying these feelings rather than the feelings themselves. <I><FONT color=brown>Enjoyment</FONT></I> is the savouring of what is pleasing; <I><FONT color=brown>delectation</FONT></I> implies a giving over of oneself to something that amuses or diverts: the <I><FONT color=brown>enjoyment</FONT></I> of conversing with good friends; the <I><FONT color=brown>delectation</FONT></I> of the theatre.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fun</FONT></B> is literally lighthearted playfulness or jesting. [He is full of <I><FONT color=brown>fun</FONT></I>; We like to insult one another in <I><FONT color=brown>fun</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Fun</FONT></I> is also a general term that may apply to any diversion which affords enjoyment, or to the enjoyment itself. [Picnics are <I><FONT color=brown>fun</FONT></I>; We had <I><FONT color=brown>fun</FONT></I> riding our bicycles to the beach today.] It may also be applied to an activity that engages one’s interest or imagination, an activity that may prove to be more than a diversion and may involve hard work: the <I><FONT color=brown>fun</FONT></I> of learning to play the piano; a lucky man who finds both <I><FONT color=brown>fun</FONT></I> and challenge in his profession; breeding pedigreed dogs for <I><FONT color=brown>fun</FONT></I> rather than for profit.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Glee</FONT></B>, once a common synonym for exuberant <I><FONT color=brown>joy</FONT></I> or for merriment, has in recent times taken on strong overtones of a malicious <I><FONT color=brown>pleasure</FONT></I> in another’s discomfiture or bad luck: clapping their hands in <I><FONT color=brown>glee</FONT></I> at the defeat of their opponent; the ghoulish <I><FONT color=brown>glee</FONT></I> of an 18<SUP>th</SUP>-century crowd at a public execution.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheerful">CHEERFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Contented">CONTENTED</A>, <A href="entry://Happiness">HAPPINESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: agony, displeasure, <A href="entry://Misery">MISERY</A>, sadness, sorrow, suffering, unhappiness.</P>

<P>These words refer to a promise that is backed up in some way and reinforced by the commitment of one’s honour or material possessions. <B><FONT color=blue>Pledge</FONT></B> is the most general of these, applying in any case where someone solemnly promises to remain loyal to a principle or to undertake a given task: a <I><FONT color=brown>pledge</FONT></I> of allegiance to the Crown; a <I><FONT color=brown>pledge</FONT></I> of $1,000 to the flood-relief fund; a <I><FONT color=brown>pledge</FONT></I> to have the alterations completed by Friday. Only the person’s honour backs up his promise in this case. <B><FONT color=blue>Guarantee</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>pledge</FONT></I> in that it is a verbal offer, but it is often backed up by an agreement, legal or otherwise, to make good any loss from failure to perform as promised: a money-back <I><FONT color=brown>guarantee</FONT></I> to those dissatisfied with the company’s product; a six-month <I><FONT color=brown>guarantee</FONT></I> on the television set for all repairs that might be necessary during that time.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bail</FONT></B> is a sum of money offered as a <I><FONT color=brown>pledge</FONT></I> by someone charged with a crime, assuring the court that he will appear for trial at a specified time. The alternative to being granted bail is to remain in prison until trial; if the accused fails to appear, his guarantor forfeits the amount <I><FONT color=brown>pledged</FONT></I> as <I><FONT color=brown>bail</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Bond</FONT></B> is comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>bail</FONT></I> in that a sum of money is posted, but differs in that the sum is set aside on behalf of someone who is accused of no crime but who might, despite evidence to the contrary, conceivably make off with money or valuables he must deal with directly in his work, or who might fail to fulfil some obligation: firms that place their cashiers under <I><FONT color=brown>bond</FONT></I>; Trainee teachers are often under a substantial <I><FONT color=brown>bond</FONT></I> to serve for a minimum period after completion of their course. Similar to <I><FONT color=brown>bond</FONT></I> is a <B><FONT color=blue>recognizance</FONT></B> or s <B><FONT color=blue>surety</FONT></B>, either in cash or one’s word, which is entered into as a promise that one will pay a debt, obey certain rules or appear when required: He was released on his own <I><FONT color=brown>recognizance</FONT></I>, pending trial; to enter into one’s own <I><FONT color=brown>surety</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Collateral</FONT></B> indicates the private possessions of value that one puts up when taking out a loan and which one forfeits if the loan is not repaid: She used some shares and some jewellery as <I><FONT color=brown>collateral</FONT></I> for the loan she was taking out. <B><FONT color=blue>Pledge</FONT></B> is sometimes euphemistically substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>collateral</FONT></I>: a loan that stipulated the <I><FONT color=brown>pledge</FONT></I> of her fur coat. <B><FONT color=blue>Security</FONT></B> can also be substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>collateral</FONT></I>, in which case it stresses the retaining of the valuables by the person making the loan. More often, the word refers to a sum of money put up upon signing certain kinds of contracts, as when one leases a house or flat; if the conditions of the contract are not met, the sum may be forfeited: one month’s rent as <I><FONT color=brown>security</FONT></I>, in addition to the first month in advance.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Assure">ASSURE</A>.</P>

<P>The act of laying waste to something or stripping it of its valuables is suggested by all these words. <B><FONT color=blue>Plunder</FONT></B> suggests, most specifically, the roving of armed men through recently conquered territory in search of money and goods: generals who permitted the city to be plundered while the inhabitants cowered behind locked doors. It can also be applied to the sizing of anything by force or fraud: innocent victims <I><FONT color=brown>plundered</FONT></I> of their life savings by fake cancer cures. It can suggest the devastation of something for financial gain: timber speculators who <I><FONT color=brown>plundered</FONT></I> irreplaceable forest lands. It is also used as a hyperbole for any act of depleting: recklessly <I><FONT color=brown>plundering</FONT></I> our liquor cabinet.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pillage</FONT></B> is less common and more formal than plunder and is restricted to the act of stripping conquered people or lands of money and goods during wartime: Visigoths who <I><FONT color=brown>pillaged</FONT></I> cathedral and synagogue without discrimination. In extended usage, the word may refer to any unscrupulous swindle or self-serving theft: He <I><FONT color=brown>pillaged</FONT></I> other writers and appropriated whole passages.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sack</FONT></B> is more extreme than <I><FONT color=brown>pillage</FONT></I>, not only implying the seizure of all valuables but usually suggesting wholesale destruction as well. A strong word, it is typically restricted to a context of war: the Greeks who <I><FONT color=brown>sacked</FONT></I> Troy; Nazi armies <I><FONT color=brown>sacking</FONT></I> Europe’s art galleries. <B><FONT color=blue>Ravage</FONT></B> means to lay waste or wreak havoc, as by <I><FONT color=brown>pillaging</FONT></I> or burning. The word has fewer implications of a search for valuables than sack and has a great many figurative uses suggesting devastation: samurai who <I><FONT color=brown>ravaged</FONT></I> the surrounding towns and farms; the disease that <I><FONT color=brown>ravaged</FONT></I> his body; open-pit mines that <I><FONT color=brown>ravaged</FONT></I> the countryside.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Loot</FONT></B> might once have been exactly synonymous with those meanings of <I><FONT color=brown>plunder</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>pillage</FONT></I> restricted to the context of war, but it now more commonly suggests the seizing of valuables by theft or riot, especially when these forays are hasty, disorganized or even aimless: <I><FONT color=brown>looting</FONT></I> the museum of two valuable paintings and destroying five others; bands of teenagers who broke store windows and <I><FONT color=brown>looted</FONT></I> the displays.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Loot">LOOT</A>, <A href="entry://Steal">STEAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to writers of poetry or verse. Only <B><FONT color=blue>poet</FONT></B>, however, can now refer to such a writer in a neutral or positive way; all the others would be understood mainly as terms of disapproval. Most often, poet implies no evaluation whatsoever: a hundred had <I><FONT color=brown>poets</FONT></I> for every good <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I>, and a hundred of those for every great <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I>. The word is sometimes inflated as a word of vague approval: the <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I> who is often more acute in pinpointing sings of social malaise than the sociologist. Often this approving use need not imply a writer of any sort: a <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I> of the piano; housewives who bring to their work the sensitivity of a <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I>. Sometimes the word can be used in disapproval to contrast a flighty sort of mental outlook with a rational one: abuses of the scientific method that mark him as a <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I> rather than a scientist. Both approving and disapproving uses of the word may reveal more about the speaker’s possibly stereotyped notions of poetry than about <I><FONT color=brown>poets</FONT></I> themselves.</P><P>A distinction is sometimes made between <B><FONT color=blue>versifier</FONT></B> and <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I>, assigning to the former all attempts to write poetry and to the latter only successful attempts: modestly insisting that he was only a <I><FONT color=brown>versifier</FONT></I>, not a <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I>; a horde of <I><FONT color=brown>versifiers</FONT></I> who could hardly be considered <I><FONT color=brown>poets</FONT></I>. This distinction is now losing ground, and <I><FONT color=brown>versifier</FONT></I> itself is becoming more pejorative, not in reference to an unsuccessful poet, but to someone whose conscious intention is to write trivial or light verse or to work in outmoded strict forms; this use classifies such a writer without reference to his success or failure at realizing his intentions: a facile <I><FONT color=brown>versifier</FONT></I> whose work appears in women’s magazines.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bard</FONT></B> was once an approving word for <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I>, but now its only conceivable use would be to poke fun at a pompous poet with an uncritical admiration for his own work: shaggy <I><FONT color=brown>bards</FONT></I> who recited their poems in coffee-shops. <B><FONT color=blue>Rhymer</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rhymester</FONT></B> refer to the making of rhymes by bad <I><FONT color=brown>versifiers</FONT></I>; once these terms could serve as general pejoratives for all writers of bad verse, but now that a greater proportion of poetry, both good and bad, may well be unrhymed, neither word is so inclusive in its disapproval. Both now would be severely pejorative of someone who turned out doggerel or who made wooden and unimaginative use of traditional forms; of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>rhymester</FONT></I> would still be left as more severely negative in tone: poems that show him to be basically a <I><FONT color=brown>rhymer</FONT></I>, still beating the heroic couplet to death; <I><FONT color=brown>rhymesters</FONT></I> who write greeting-card jingles.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Poetess</FONT></B> was once a neutral term applying to a woman <I><FONT color=brown>poet</FONT></I>. Like most feminine forms (except actress, heroine, etc.), the word has gone out of fashion; most women <I><FONT color=brown>poets</FONT></I> would now find the term offensive, if not insulting, although many people might, without understanding this change of fashion, still use the term innocently enough. <B><FONT color=blue>Poetaster</FONT></B> is the most clearly pejorative of all these words and has never had any uses or connotations other than those pertaining to extreme disapproval. The word indicates insincere, affected, bad writing in verse by a person of no talent, often in imitation of prevailing styles of his day, often to at least momentary critical acclaim: <I><FONT color=brown>poetasters</FONT></I> who win prizes and get fellowships, while good <I><FONT color=brown>poets</FONT></I> go begging.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artist">ARTIST</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to verbal compositions that have greater intensity than prose or normal speech, a quality achieved by heightened language, imagery, rhythms or sound relationships. <B><FONT color=blue>Poetry</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>verse</FONT></B> are frequently used as complements, in which case verse indicates all such attempts at heightened effect, while <I><FONT color=brown>poetry</FONT></I> is reserved for works in which these attempts are successful: distilling the true <I><FONT color=brown>poetry</FONT></I> from the mass of <I><FONT color=brown>verse</FONT></I> written by Victorian poets. This use has recently been losing ground, since <I><FONT color=brown>verse</FONT></I> all by itself can suggest work of this sort that is written in traditional forms or using traditional methods such as rhyme and metre: often the word, unqualified, can suggest light or trivial products that make no attempt at any heightening of intensity: greeting-card <I><FONT color=brown>verse</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Poetry</FONT></I>, by contrast, is more and more used neutrally in a generic way, depending on qualifiers for any indication of success or failure: writing voluminous amounts of both good and bad <I><FONT color=brown>poetry</FONT></I> in his final phase. The word still retains a positive tone when used in a wider, less exact way: a view of life touched with <I><FONT color=brown>poetry</FONT></I>. Here it points to an indefinable emotional intensity. As in the above examples, <I><FONT color=brown>verse</FONT></I> is commonly used in a collective or general sense ?although in a strictly prosodic sense it may denote only one of the lines making up a stanza, e.g., there are 14 <I><FONT color=brown>verses</FONT></I> in a sonnet.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Doggerel</FONT></B> refers specifically to bad <I><FONT color=brown>verse</FONT></I>, usually suggesting trivial, banal work full of cliches, inept images and tedious rhythms: the <I><FONT color=brown>doggerel</FONT></I> scribbled on the walls of public lavatories. As a pejorative hyperbole for any <I><FONT color=brown>poetry</FONT></I> one does not like, the word still need not impugn the writer’s attempt at intensified utterance ?only his total failure to achieve it: critics who agreed that the most honoured poet of the preceding era had seldom written anything but <I><FONT color=brown>doggerel</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Jingle</FONT></B>, by contrast, usually points to no serious attempt at intensity, but suggests instead an extreme simplicity of language coupled with singsong or monotonous rhythms. The word may have a neutral or descriptive relevance: nursery <I><FONT color=brown>jingles</FONT></I>. More often, the word suggests disapproval for tedious metre used to drive home an insipid or commercial message, often one set to music: advertising <I><FONT color=brown>jingles</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Rhyme</FONT></B> once functional much like <I><FONT color=brown>verse</FONT></I>, referring to work done in traditional form. At one point, in fact, it could be used as a generic term for all <I><FONT color=brown>poetry</FONT></I>: his essay on <I><FONT color=brown>rhyme</FONT></I>. The word now appears odd and archaic, especially when spelt <I><FONT color=brown>rime</FONT></I> as of old, and would not be used except for satirical purposes: reciting his poem, "The <I><FONT color=brown>Rime</FONT></I> of the Elder Statesmen.] <B><FONT color=blue>Poesy</FONT></B> could once be used in as general a way as <I><FONT color=brown>poetry</FONT></I>, but with a more lyrical and approving tone. Now the word’s only use is in caustic disapproval of <I><FONT color=brown>verse</FONT></I> that is over-elegant, precious or genteel: his ladylike sheaf of <I><FONT color=brown>poesy</FONT></I> about life’s trials.</P><P>SEE; <A href="entry://Narrative">NARRATIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Slogan">SLOGAN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: prose.</P>

<P>These words are used to characterize a manner of social intercourse that is designed to lease, or at least not to give offence. <B><FONT color=blue>Polite</FONT></B> implies punctilious observance of the forms of speech and action customary among well-bred persons: It was not <I><FONT color=brown>polite</FONT></I> of him to replay to your question so hastily and with such an obvious lack of thought. <B><FONT color=blue>Civil</FONT></B> is weaker than <I><FONT color=brown>polite</FONT></I>, suggesting nothing more than an avoidance of rudeness: a saleswoman who was <I><FONT color=brown>civil</FONT></I> but never really interested in helping her customers. To be <B><FONT color=blue>courteous</FONT></B> is to be <I><FONT color=brown>polite</FONT></I> while having also a warm regard for the feelings and dignity of others: a policeman who managed to be <I><FONT color=brown>courteous</FONT></I> to a furious woman who was abusing him without just cause. <B><FONT color=blue>Courtly</FONT></B> means <I><FONT color=brown>polite</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>courteous</FONT></I> in a ceremonial way, as befits a royal court; it is applied to men and implies an old-fashioned or elegant observance of formal courtesies, especially towards women: a <I><FONT color=brown>courtly</FONT></I> gentleman of the old school. A <I><FONT color=brown>courtly</FONT></I> foreign diplomat.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mannerly</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>well-mannered</FONT></B> are alike in suggesting the kind of politeness which is evidenced by strict adherence to a code of etiquette. Since there are no overtones to these words, there is no indication when someone is called mannerly or <I><FONT color=brown>well-mannered</FONT></I> if he is actually courteous or merely careful about outward appearances. <B><FONT color=blue>Well-behaved</FONT></B> can mean <I><FONT color=brown>mannerly</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>well-mannered</FONT></I>, especially when it is used to describe a young person who is well versed in social graces. But it is often used to refer to the discipline or control demonstrated by a person or, especially, by a group of persons in a difficult or trying situation; a crowd that was surprisingly quiet and <I><FONT color=brown>well-behaved</FONT></I> considering how long they had to wait in a hot, stuffy room.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Behaviour">BEHAVIOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Considerate">CONSIDERATE</A>, <A href="entry://Urbane">URBANE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Gauche">GAUCHE</A>, rude.</P>

pollute
<B><FONT color=blue>pollute</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>adulterate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>contaminate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pervert</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>vitiate</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to tainting or dirtying something or otherwise impairing its integrity, purity or effectiveness. <B><FONT color=blue>Pollute</FONT></B> now most commonly indicates a thoroughgoing physical befouling that renders something noisome or noxious to health or life. [Some factories <I><FONT color=brown>pollute</FONT></I> our water supply by dumping untreated chemical wastes into streams and rivers; The fumes from furnaces and motor vehicles have <I><FONT color=brown>polluted</FONT></I> the air we breathe and shortened our life expectancy.] Recent usage of the word has focused so heavily on such instances that other uses are taken as metaphorical extensions of this meaning: political debate <I><FONT color=brown>polluted</FONT></I> by recriminations and unfounded allegations. Actually, an earlier use of the word referred directly to any defiling of sanctity or of physical or moral purity: temples <I><FONT color=brown>polluted</FONT></I> by barbarian invaders.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Contaminate</FONT></B> refers to the spreading of harmful or undesirable impurities may be negligible or, as is the case for <I><FONT color=brown>pollute</FONT></I>, thoroughgoing and widespread. In addition, where <I><FONT color=brown>pollute</FONT></I> often indicates readily apparent or grossly visible impurities, <I><FONT color=brown>contaminate</FONT></I> is often the word of choice where the change is slow, devious, unsuspected or not noticeably by ordinary means: an order to burn all linen that may have come into contact with smallpox victims or have been otherwise <I><FONT color=brown>contaminated</FONT></I>; official denials that the atmosphere had been seriously <I><FONT color=brown>contaminated</FONT></I> by radioactive fallout from the testing of hydrogen bombs. In other uses, the word is milder than <I><FONT color=brown>pollute</FONT></I> in that it can sometimes suggest a temporary tinge rather than an irrevocable stain.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Adulterate</FONT></B> has special relevance to food products to which harmful, low-quality or low-cost substances have been deliberately and deceptively added in order to defraud the buyer: sausages <I><FONT color=brown>adulterated</FONT></I> with bread crumbs and food flavouring; milk <I><FONT color=brown>adulterated</FONT></I> with water. Theoretically, the word can apply to other products debased by additives, even where no intent to defraud exists, but such uses are rare. In its widest applications, the word can apply to any mixture of good and bad where the latter seems deliberately included by the producer in the hope that it will go unnoticed: academic curricula <I><FONT color=brown>adulterated</FONT></I> with courses on everything from social dancing to surfboard acrobatics.</P><P>The remaining words apply more generally than the foregoing and do not have specific applications to some concrete situation. <B><FONT color=blue>Pervert</FONT></B> indicates misdirecting something, leading it astray or turning it in a wrong direction, as away from the good, pure and moral, and towards what is depraved or evil: television personalities who <I><FONT color=brown>pervert</FONT></I> discussion programmes into freak shows for the airing of lunatic-fringe ideas; a beautiful novel that was wilfully <I><FONT color=brown>perverted</FONT></I> by Hollywood into a sex-and-sadism spectacular. As can be seen, the word suggests a grotesque or hideous transformation; this makes it even more emphatic than <I><FONT color=brown>pollute</FONT></I> in comparable uses, although here complete alteration is indicated, rather than the inclusion of additives: an attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>pervert</FONT></I> the truth by appealing to dishonest, ignorant and irresponsible bigotry. A specific sense of the word once referred to something that caused sexual deviation, but this use is more and more avoided because of its tone of judgement.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Vitiate</FONT></B> is the most general word here, having no area of concrete reference. It applies widely to whatever can be seen as completely nullifying the value of something: an overweening arrogance that <I><FONT color=brown>vitiates</FONT></I> all his efforts to make friends. Sometimes the word is used only for impairment rather than complete destruction: an irresponsible act that to some extent <I><FONT color=brown>vitiates</FONT></I> our claim that we are seeking peaceful solutions to the crisis. More often the word suggests that one thing cancles out or invalidates another: pay rises <I><FONT color=brown>vitiated</FONT></I> by the rising cost of living.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, <A href="entry://Discolour">DISCOLOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Harm">HARM</A>, <A href="entry://Hurt">HURT</A>, <A href="entry://Soil">SOIL</A>, <A href="entry://Waste">WASTE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clean">CLEAN</A>, purge, purify, <A href="entry://Sanitate">SANITIZE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>polygamy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bigamy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>polyandry</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>polygyny</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a married state in which someone has more than one spouse. <B><FONT color=blue>Polygamy</FONT></B> is a general term for any situation in which more than two people are knowingly joined in marriage. The word can refer to a husband with more than one wife, a wife with more than one husband, or to group marriages in which two or more husbands are married to two or more wives: a text dealing with varieties of <I><FONT color=brown>polygamy</FONT></I> in primitive cultures. Outside an anthropological context, the word is often understood to refer directly to the situation of a husband with two or more wives, since this departure from monogamy has been more widely dealt with (and perhaps practised) than other departures: the <I><FONT color=brown>polygamy</FONT></I> of the early Mormons. <B><FONT color=blue>Polygyny</FONT></B> would be the strict anthropological term for this situation in which two or more wives are married to one husband: linking the practice of <I><FONT color=brown>polygyny</FONT></I> with cultural assumptions about the innate inferiority of women; the disappearance of <I><FONT color=brown>polygyny</FONT></I> from Turkey with the emancipation of women.</P><P>By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>polyandry</FONT></B> points specifically to the marrying of two or more husbands to one wife: matriarchal cultures that have <I><FONT color=brown>polyandry</FONT></I> as a concomitant. <B><FONT color=blue>Bigamy</FONT></B> refers as a legal term in Western civilization to the crime of being married to more than one spouse at the same time; the word functions for either sex. At first it might seem that the term is a legal divorce and marrying another while claiming to be unmarried. The word usually suggests a situation in which there is deception of at least one of the spouses, since few people in a monogamous society presumably consent to marry someone already married. Even in those instances where a deceiving <I><FONT color=brown>bigamist</FONT></I> sets up two households and alternates visits to both, a true situation of <I><FONT color=brown>polygamy</FONT></I> does not exist, since this word most often indicates spouses who knowingly share the same house-hold and are married to the same person as well.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: monogamy, monogyny.</P>

<P>These words refer to the vivid presentation of material in the graphic arts or some other medium of communication. <B><FONT color=blue>Portray</FONT></B>, most specifically, suggests capturing a likeness, usually of a single person: a painting that <I><FONT color=brown>portrayed</FONT></I> the actress in her most famous role. It is frequently used, however, to refer to the detailed discussion of any subject, concrete or abstract: an article that attempted to <I><FONT color=brown>portray</FONT></I> the habits of the typical Australian family. Even in its most abstract uses, the word still suggests catching something in its most characteristic aspect. <B><FONT color=blue>Depict</FONT></B> is similar to portray but more general in suggesting the artistic re-creation of any scene: <I><FONT color=brown>depicting</FONT></I> the landscape just at the moment of its greatest autumnal ripeness. Where <I><FONT color=brown>portray</FONT></I> suggests catching the most revealing aspect of something, <I><FONT color=brown>depict</FONT></I> suggests a choice between equally valid possibilities: <I><FONT color=brown>depicting</FONT></I> the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century in light of the Industrial Revolution. The word may also suggest a deliberate departure from reality: actually <I><FONT color=brown>depicting</FONT></I> me, without a shred of evidence, as a scheming charlatan.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Delineate</FONT></B>, in the graphic arts, usually refers to a line drawing, but one that is subtle and careful about accuracy and detail. In other media the word suggests the same fullness and vividness: <I><FONT color=brown>delineating</FONT></I> in a magazine article the many undercurrents of dissent that affected the election; The actress <I><FONT color=brown>delineated</FONT></I> with remarkable versatility the many-faceted character of Catherine the Great.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sketch</FONT></B> is used in application to a quick usually undetailed, rendering of a subject, but one that is nonetheless readily recognizable; while the word may imply haste, it does not necessarily indicate carelessness or inaccuracy: quickly <I><FONT color=brown>sketching</FONT></I> a dress that was being modelled in a fashion show; <I><FONT color=brown>sketching</FONT></I> out the main points of the subject matter which he would cover exhaustively later in the term.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Represent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>describe</FONT></B> are less dependent on the context of the visual arts for their implications. Of the two, only <I><FONT color=brown>represent</FONT></I> can be used in this context at all, in which case it is more like <I><FONT color=brown>depict</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>portray</FONT></I>: a woodcut <I><FONT color=brown>representing</FONT></I> the harbour as it appeared to the first settlers. In any context, <I><FONT color=brown>represent</FONT></I> can imply a symbolic or typical rather than a literal rendering: a classic statue that <I><FONT color=brown>represents</FONT></I> the human body as devoid of individuality; <I><FONT color=brown>representing</FONT></I> nuclear proliferation as the greatest threat to world peace. It can also suggest the arbitrary choosing of one thing to stand for something else, even when there is no resemblance between the two things: In <I><FONT color=brown>describing</FONT></I> the bombing mission at dinner, he used water glasses to represent enemy targets. <I><FONT color=brown>Describe</FONT></I>, most specifically, suggests the citing of details that will create a visual image in the mind of an audience; it thus suggests a context of discussion or the verbal arts: a novelist who can vividly <I><FONT color=brown>describe</FONT></I> a landscape; a patient able to <I><FONT color=brown>describe</FONT></I> his symptoms accurately to the doctor. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>represent</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>depict</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>describe</FONT></I> necessarily suggests a literal, realistic rendering.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Graphic">GRAPHIC</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the relationship between a person and his belongings or to anything and its attributes. <B><FONT color=blue>Possess</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>own</FONT></B> both stress belongings; <I><FONT color=brown>possess</FONT></I> is slightly more formal: people who large quantities of material goods; families who <I><FONT color=brown>own</FONT></I> at least one television set. But <I><FONT color=brown>own</FONT></I> suggests some legal act of acquisition, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>possess</FONT></I> may simply refer to goods that now belong to someone, however acquired: hire-purchase instalments that allow customers to <I><FONT color=brown>possess</FONT></I> goods before they can be said to <I><FONT color=brown>own</FONT></I> them fully. <I><FONT color=brown>Possess</FONT></I>, is often used to relate something to its attributes, while <I><FONT color=brown>own</FONT></I> is unlikely to be used in this way: a face <I><FONT color=brown>possessing</FONT></I> great strength of character.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Have</FONT></B> is the least specific of these words and is far less clear than the rest about the kind of relationship suggested. It may be used as an informal substitute for either <I><FONT color=brown>possess</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>own</FONT></I>: a way of smiling that has great charm; families that have more than one car. In a slang sense conveying a suggestion of <I><FONT color=brown>possessing</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>have</FONT></I> also means to assert power over: One more idea like that and I'll <I><FONT color=brown>have</FONT></I> you for it. A related use, usually with "on," means to keep guessing in a teasing way: I’m sure he was <I><FONT color=brown>having</FONT></I> you on and was not really serious.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hold</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>keep</FONT></B> add suggestions of retention or control to <I><FONT color=brown>possess</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>own</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Hold</FONT></I> can mean to guard something against seizure, even from someone who may rightfully <I><FONT color=brown>own</FONT></I> it: <I><FONT color=brown>holding</FONT></I> the land despite legal notices to surrender it. <I><FONT color=brown>Compared</FONT></I> to have, it stresses conviction: <I><FONT color=brown>have</FONT></I> an opinion; <I><FONT color=brown>hold</FONT></I> an opinion. It can also substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>own</FONT></I>, in which case it has a legal tone and may suggest resources not actually used: <I><FONT color=brown>holding</FONT></I> estates in Ireland that he had never seen. It can be used in reference to something put in trust for someone else who actually <I><FONT color=brown>owns</FONT></I> it: <I><FONT color=brown>holding</FONT></I> the moneys for you until you come of age. <I><FONT color=brown>Keep</FONT></I> may suggest preventing someone else from <I><FONT color=brown>possessing</FONT></I> something: <I><FONT color=brown>keeping</FONT></I> the aspirin away from the children. It may also stress safety or emotional attachment: <I><FONT color=brown>keeping</FONT></I> the bonds in a strongbox; wishing to <I><FONT color=brown>keep</FONT></I> the programme as a souvenir.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Carry">CARRY</A>, <A href="entry://Conserve">CONSERVE</A>, <A href="entry://Control">CONTROL</A>, <A href="entry://Include">INCLUDE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: borrow, dispossess, <A href="entry://Relinquish">RELINQUISH</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to put off the some future time. <B><FONT color=blue>Postpone</FONT></B> usually suggests putting something aside until something else occurs, or is done, known, obtained, etc. [The conference will be <I><FONT color=brown>postponed</FONT></I> until one week from next Friday; We are <I><FONT color=brown>postponing</FONT></I> our trip until the weather grows warmer.] However, <I><FONT color=brown>postpone</FONT></I> is often used without this limitation and may imply the intention of putting off an activity until some undetermined future time; to <I><FONT color=brown>postpone</FONT></I> planning for the future.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Adjourn</FONT></B> is literally to <I><FONT color=brown>postpone</FONT></I> until another day or place. The word is customarily applied to a meeting of an organization or any formally constructed gathering, such as a legislative or deliberative body, which is brought to an end, especially with a view towards assembling again at a specified time or place. [The hearing will be <I><FONT color=brown>adjourned</FONT></I> until tomorrow morning at ten o’clock; The House <I><FONT color=brown>adjourns</FONT></I> in time for the elections.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Delay</FONT></B> means to <I><FONT color=brown>postpone</FONT></I> to an indefinite future time, usually because of obstacles that impede progress. It has the strong implication of lateness or tardiness. Often such obstacles are unavoidable: Their arrival will be <I><FONT color=brown>delayed</FONT></I> because of heavy traffic. On the other hand, delay may suggest failure to do something at the expected or proper time through either carelessness or reluctance: to <I><FONT color=brown>delay</FONT></I> fixing the roof although it leaked badly; to <I><FONT color=brown>delay</FONT></I> having an infected tooth pulled.</P><P>The suggestion of arbitrary lateness and putting off that resides in delay is absent from <B><FONT color=blue>defer</FONT></B>. Etymologically, <I><FONT color=brown>defer</FONT></I> means to refrain from dealing with, and implies the intentional <I><FONT color=brown>delaying</FONT></I> of an action in a more emphatic way than does <I><FONT color=brown>postpone</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>defer</FONT></I> payment of one’s bills until the Christmas bonus is awarded.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Suspend</FONT></B>, in this sense, is to discontinue or to withhold temporarily but indefinitely, pending the fulfilment of certain conditions. [Bus service will be <I><FONT color=brown>suspended</FONT></I> until the highway is repaired; A scientist <I><FONT color=brown>suspends</FONT></I> judgement and refrains from drawing conclusions until all the facts are known.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: schedule.</P>

<P>These words refer to an inability to act in one’s own behalf. <B><FONT color=blue>Powerless</FONT></B> indicates an inability to act because of outside resistance. <B><FONT color=blue>Helpless</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests someone incapable of action because of his own inadequacy, without reference to externals. These distinctions are completely at variance with what both words might seem to suggest (lack of power; lack of external help): a decision by his superiors that left him <I><FONT color=brown>powerless</FONT></I> to act; <I><FONT color=brown>helpless</FONT></I> as an infant who must be nursed and watched every second of the day. Both words can, of course, be used in the context more appropriate to the other; <I><FONT color=brown>helpless</FONT></I>, especially, can refer to someone literally without aid or assistance: a last survivor who was <I><FONT color=brown>helpless</FONT></I> to prevent the Maoris from capturing the fort.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Paralysed</FONT></B> in this context compares an inability to act with muscular disablement; <B><FONT color=blue>impotent</FONT></B> here compares the same inability to sexual disablement.

Both words can also refer to a will made powerless or a normal routine frustrated by external forces: a city paralysed by the striking union; red tape that left the chairman <I><FONT color=brown>impotent</FONT></I> to innovate or experiment. <I><FONT color=brown>Paralysed</FONT></I> is the more intense of these two words, suggesting a greater crisis and a greater difficulty of resolution.

<P>These words all pertain to the act of commending someone or something. <B><FONT color=blue>Praise</FONT></B> is the most general of these and the least formal. It can refer to overall approval: He <I><FONT color=brown>praised</FONT></I> his friend as being one of the finest human beings he had ever met. Or it can refer to a specific accomplishment: All the critics <I><FONT color=brown>praised</FONT></I> the new play for its originality and emotional impact. Sometimes the word can suggest the approval of a superior: a teacher who never forgot to <I><FONT color=brown>praise</FONT></I> the slow learner who struggled to master the day’s lesson. When the situation is reversed, homage to the Deity is usually involved: They <I><FONT color=brown>praised</FONT></I> God for their safe deliverance from the perils of the flood. At its weakest, it can refer to the mere paying of compliments that may or may not be sincere: Confidence men usually <I><FONT color=brown>praise</FONT></I> the shrewdness of the gullible victims they are in the process of fleecing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Laud</FONT></B> indicates the highest of <I><FONT color=brown>praise</FONT></I> and may suggest recognition of a special or formal kind: a citation that <I><FONT color=brown>lauded</FONT></I> him for his twenty years of service with the firm. The word can indicate excessive <I><FONT color=brown>praise</FONT></I>, as well, or praise formalized, officious or ceremonious: a set of annual screen awards broken down into so many categories that even bit players stood a chance of being <I><FONT color=brown>lauded</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Extol</FONT></B> also suggests formal <I><FONT color=brown>praise</FONT></I>. The word’s derivation from a Latin root meaning to raise up is reflected in its suggestion of an intention to elevate or magnify the recipient: The associate professor was publicly <I><FONT color=brown>extolled</FONT></I> by his head of department on the occasion of his promotion to full professor.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Eulogize</FONT></B> often suggests formal <I><FONT color=brown>praise</FONT></I> given in a public speech, although the word can also apply to a written tribute. The word can imply a public or official testimonial, particularly one delivered at a funeral: friends who came forward to <I><FONT color=brown>eulogize</FONT></I> the dead hero. <B><FONT color=blue>Acclaim</FONT></B> suggests applause or vocal approval, especially by a mass of well-wishers: The party meeting <I><FONT color=brown>acclaimed</FONT></I> the nominee with an uproarious demonstration of their support. Used more generally, the word can suggest widespread popularity or public backing: The whole nation <I><FONT color=brown>acclaimed</FONT></I> the court’s history-making decision; a singer <I><FONT color=brown>acclaimed</FONT></I> far and wide for his unique vocal style.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Applause">APPLAUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Award">AWARD</A>, <A href="entry://Respect">RESPECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Belittle">BELITTLE</A>, censure, condemn, discredit.</P>

<P>These words refer to a stance or position that is endangered by lack of balance, solid footing, unwavering strength or unchanging conditions. <B><FONT color=blue>Precarious</FONT></B> is the most formal of these and most restricted to the situation of a dangerous imbalance for whatever reason: the ladder propped at a <I><FONT color=brown>precarious</FONT></I> angle against the wall; his precarious perch on the window sill. The word can also refer to things that can put one in danger of falling: a <I><FONT color=brown>precarious</FONT></I> path that wound its way around the mountainside; sand dunes too near the ocean and too <I><FONT color=brown>precarious</FONT></I> for building houses on. In less concrete situations, the word stresses risk or danger more than the possibility of imbalance or falling: a <I><FONT color=brown>precarious</FONT></I> theory that could only lead to war. Unless the word’s concrete overtones are remembered, a mixed metaphor may result: his <I><FONT color=brown>precarious</FONT></I> resistance to change.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Insecure</FONT></B> also indicates an untenable position, but it is much wider in application and less open to mixed metaphor. The word suggests exposure to threat or danger of any kind, not just that of falling: rendering <I><FONT color=brown>insecure</FONT></I> the enemy’s position in the valley by capturing the foothills surrounding it. The word has also become a fad word for psychological states of uncertainty, doubt or confusion: a child made <I><FONT color=brown>insecure</FONT></I> by the conflicting demands made on him by his parents.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unstable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unsteady</FONT></B> also refer to untenable positions. <I><FONT color=brown>Unstable</FONT></I> emphasizes impermanence, suggesting a foundation that is capable of changing or shifting: Venetian palazzos built on <I><FONT color=brown>unstable</FONT></I> islands that have been sinking for a century. It may also suggest infirm support of any kind: nailing in crosspieces to strengthen the <I><FONT color=brown>unstable</FONT></I> uprights of the bookcase. <I><FONT color=brown>Unstable</FONT></I>, in a wider context, can refer to a substance that tends to break down or change drastically: an electrically charged, <I><FONT color=brown>unstable</FONT></I> form of oxygen. It can also refer to an erratic or dangerous personality: an <I><FONT color=brown>unstable</FONT></I> eccentric who conceived of great schemes he never executed; an <I><FONT color=brown>unstable</FONT></I> sociopath who was capable of committing murder without a qualm. The more informal <I><FONT color=brown>unsteady</FONT></I> concentrates on one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>unstable</FONT></I>, indicating a lack of firm support: a short leg that made the table <I><FONT color=brown>unsteady</FONT></I>. It can, however, also point to any sort of wavering or less-than-constant application: <I><FONT color=brown>unsteady</FONT></I> flashes of light; capable only of divided and <I><FONT color=brown>unsteady</FONT></I> attention.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Danger">DANGER</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: firm, safe, stable, steady.</P>

<P>These words refer to attempts to indicate what course the future will take. <B><FONT color=blue>Predict</FONT></B> is the most commonly used in the widest variety of situations; it can range in suggestion from the mere hazarding of a guess, or a wish, to the making of an astute statistical estimate about the likely outcome of an event: <I><FONT color=brown>predicting</FONT></I> that he would be miserable without her; <I><FONT color=brown>predicting</FONT></I> the results of the election with amazing accuracy. As in the last example, it is commonly used to refer to the activities of professional poll-takers. Like <I><FONT color=brown>predict</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>forecast</FONT></B> can range in use from the general or vague to the specific, but in this case its most specific use ?for <I><FONT color=brown>predicting</FONT></I> weather ?has crowded out other uses of the word: Weather satellites that make it easier to <I><FONT color=brown>forecast</FONT></I> cyclones.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Divine</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>foreshadow</FONT></B> are both concerned with suggesting rather than <I><FONT color=brown>predicting</FONT></I> the future, especially through the giving or assessing of subtle hints or clues. <I><FONT color=brown>Divine</FONT></I> implies someone capable of reading present evidence in all its ambiguity and seeing where it must lead: the first political commentator to <I><FONT color=brown>divine</FONT></I> in Hitler’s threats the imminent upheaval of Europe. The word originally suggested supernatural powers of clairvoyance, but it is now seldom used in this sense. <I><FONT color=brown>Foreshadow</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>divine</FONT></I>, does not necessarily imply a shrewd reader of clues; it can refer to anyone or anything that gives an indication of what is to come: Hitler’s plan of action <I><FONT color=brown>foreshadowed</FONT></I> the actual course of events so unmistakably that anyone should have been able to <I><FONT color=brown>divine</FONT></I> it. The word is often used to refer to a storyteller’s hints about what will happen eventually in his story: the novelist’s skilful <I><FONT color=brown>foreshadowing</FONT></I> of her heroine’s eventual tragic decline. During a meeting one may <I><FONT color=brown>foreshadow</FONT></I> a motion, usually to suggest that it may soon be moved in an effort to settle or clarify some matter under discussion at the moment.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>divine</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>augur</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>prophesy</FONT></B> and even <B><FONT color=blue>foretell</FONT></B> once suggested a supernatural ability to "read" the future. Now they have mainly lost this use, although they still suggest, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>predict</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>forecast</FONT></I>, a future that is already set and determined rather than one that can be rationally assumed from the evidence at hand. Of these three, <I><FONT color=brown>augur</FONT></I> is most like <I><FONT color=brown>divine</FONT></I> in implying a reading of subtle omens and clues as a way of prefiguring what is to come: <I><FONT color=brown>auguring</FONT></I> from a host of economic indicators that the present boom would continue unabated. The word, like <I><FONT color=brown>foreshadow</FONT></I>, can also refer to the sign or clue itself: a trend that <I><FONT color=brown>augured</FONT></I> well for the company. <I><FONT color=brown>Prophesy</FONT></I> is more portentous-sounding than <I><FONT color=brown>augur</FONT></I>, suggesting authoritative wisdom and acumen: the only pundit to <I><FONT color=brown>prophesy</FONT></I> a confrontation with Red China. Both <I><FONT color=brown>augur</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>prophesy</FONT></I> are sometimes used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>predict</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>forecast</FONT></I> to give a higher tone or to suggest unerring accuracy; many would find the uses questionable: poll-takers <I><FONT color=brown>auguring</FONT></I> a record majority for the party in power. <I><FONT color=brown>Foretell</FONT></I> now has fewer residual implications of the supernatural than augur and <I><FONT color=brown>prophesy</FONT></I>, as well as being far less formal. It would still sound odd as a substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>predict</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>forecast</FONT></I>. Like <I><FONT color=brown>foreshadow</FONT></I>, it can refer to the clue rather than to its reader: signs of a struggle that <I><FONT color=brown>foretold</FONT></I> a violent end for the kidnapped banker. It is often used negatively in referring to the past: Who could have <I><FONT color=brown>foretold</FONT></I> that such a routine tour was to culminate in such a tragedy?</P><P>In contrast to the words just discussed, <B><FONT color=blue>prognosticate</FONT></B> comes from a different context altogether. It suggests a knowledgeable look at the symptoms of a disease in order to determine its likely outcome. This give it a specific pertinence to medicine similar to <I><FONT color=brown>predict</FONT></I> for poll-taking and <I><FONT color=brown>forecast</FONT></I> for meteorology. Used outside this area, the word suggests inside knowledge, expertise or shrewdness, but is often used comically or pejoratively: <I><FONT color=brown>prognosticating</FONT></I> what effect another garlic pickle would have on his digestion.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Expectation">EXPECTATION</A>, <A href="entry://Foreknowledge">FOREKNOWLEDGE</A>, <A href="entry://Hope">HOPE</A>, <A href="entry://Premonition">PREMONITION</A>.</P>

premonition
<B><FONT color=blue>premonition</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>forerunner</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>harbinger</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inkling</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>omen</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>portent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>precursor</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>presentiment</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a sense, indication or sign of something to come. Most, but not all, partake of the prophetic, and some directly involve superstition. A <B><FONT color=blue>premonition</FONT></B> is instinctive, based on an indefinable feeling rather than on actual information received. It may be good or bad, may come in sleep or wakefulness, and may be either borne out or proved false by later events. [A <I><FONT color=brown>premonition</FONT></I> that she would win led her to take a chance in the raffle; He had a <I><FONT color=brown>premonition</FONT></I> of his father’s death.] Some <I><FONT color=brown>premonitions</FONT></I> are purely irrational or superstitious; others, possible instances of extrasensory perception. <B><FONT color=blue>Presentiment</FONT></B> is very close to <I><FONT color=brown>premonition</FONT></I> in meaning but is more formal in tone. Etymologically, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>premonition</FONT></I> stresses the idea of an advance warning given to the mind, <I><FONT color=brown>presentiment</FONT></I> points to a sort of inner perception, usually an instinctive feeling of foreboding, a sense that misfortune or calamity is at hand: a terrifying, but totally unfounded <I><FONT color=brown>presentiment</FONT></I> that his life was in great danger; a <I><FONT color=brown>presentiment</FONT></I> that the ship was going to sink. Like a <I><FONT color=brown>premonition</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>presentiment</FONT></I>, an <B><FONT color=blue>inkling</FONT></B> is an intimation of something yet unknown. Getting an inkling of something, however, does not require prophetic powers or ESP. Instead, the ability to interpret natural signs, to pick up hints or to guess on the basis of a paucity of information is involved. [A few veiled hints she dropped gave me my first <I><FONT color=brown>inkling</FONT></I> of her purpose.] Unlike the other words, it is often used negatively in disclaiming or denying any knowledge of something. [I haven’t the slightest <I><FONT color=brown>inkling</FONT></I> of what he is going to do.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Omen</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>portent</FONT></B> differ from the foregoing in that they designate outward and visible signs that are regarded as prophetic and are subject to interpretation. Both words strongly imply a superstitious response. To those who believe in them, there are both good and evil <I><FONT color=brown>omens</FONT></I>. A stork nesting on the roof, for example, is considered a good <I><FONT color=brown>omen</FONT></I> in many European countries. A black cat crossing one’s path is thought to be an evil <I><FONT color=brown>omen</FONT></I>. Unlike an <I><FONT color=brown>omen</FONT></I>, which may be favourable, a <I><FONT color=brown>portent</FONT></I> more often, though not always, indicates impending evil. A <I><FONT color=brown>portent</FONT></I> may be a sign, an event, a wonder, a natural or unnatural phenomenon: a sailor’s belief in luck and in supernatural portents. It may be something momentous, to marvel at, as a flaming comet; or it may be something ominous and heavy with foreboding, as a total eclipse. [Calpurnia’s <I><FONT color=brown>premonition</FONT></I> of Caesar’s death came in the form of a prophetic dream; Casca saw a fiery tempest, a slave with a flaming, unescorted hand, a lion in the Capitol, and other prodigious <I><FONT color=brown>portents</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Omen</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>portent</FONT></I>, modified by words like black, bad, ill or evil, may also mean ominous significance: a bird of evil <I><FONT color=brown>omen</FONT></I>; a cloud of black <I><FONT color=brown>portent</FONT></I>.</P><P>The remaining words refer to a messenger or herald who signals the approach of a coming person or thing. Formerly, a <B><FONT color=blue>harbinger</FONT></B> was a courier who rode in advance of a party to arrange for their lodging. Now, though the word may mean anyone in the vanguard who is a preparer of the way, it is more often used figuratively of a person or thing that heralds the approach of a change. [An autumn frost is a <I><FONT color=brown>harbinger</FONT></I> of winter; The wren is a <I><FONT color=brown>harbinger</FONT></I> of spring.] Unlike the other words in this set, the designations <B><FONT color=blue>forerunner</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>precursor</FONT></B> may indicate <I><FONT color=brown>hindsight</FONT></I> rather than foresight, pointing to an advance sign that is seen as such only in terms of later events. Both words share the same etymological meaning, <I><FONT color=brown>precursor</FONT></I> meaning <I><FONT color=brown>forerunner</FONT></I> in Latin. They now differ somewhat in use, however. <I><FONT color=brown>Forerunner</FONT></I> more strongly retains the original sense of a person who goes ahead as a messenger to proclaim the coming of another. John the Baptist is known as the <I><FONT color=brown>Forerunner</FONT></I> since he heralded the coming of Christ. The word <I><FONT color=brown>precursor</FONT></I> was also used of John the Baptist; but where <I><FONT color=brown>forerunner</FONT></I> stresses the announcement of a more important person’s coming, <I><FONT color=brown>precursor</FONT></I> implies a laying of the groundwork for a later, more significant, accomplishment. Both <I><FONT color=brown>forerunner</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>precursor</FONT></I> may refer to a predecessor in a particular line of development, or an advance indication of something to come. [John Wyclif was one of the main <I><FONT color=brown>forerunners</FONT></I> of the Reformation and an important <I><FONT color=brown>precursor</FONT></I> of Martine Luther.] Used of signs or symptoms, both words may be unfavourable in tone. [Overweight and shortness of breath were the <I><FONT color=brown>precursors</FONT></I> of a heart attack; a localized border conflict that turned out to be the <I><FONT color=brown>precursor</FONT></I> of a world war; Widespread moral corruption and decadence are often the <I><FONT color=brown>forerunners</FONT></I> of national decline.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>, <A href="entry://Expectation">EXPECTATION</A>, <A href="entry://Hint">HINT</A>, <A href="entry://Predict">PREDICT</A>, <A href="entry://Symptom">SYMPTOM</A>.</P>

preoccupied
<B><FONT color=blue>preoccupied</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>absorbed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>engrossed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>involved</FONT></B>:

<P>These words describe persons whose complete attention is held or whose total concern is aroused by a particular subject. <B><FONT color=blue>Preoccupied</FONT></B> points to a mind taken up with a certain line of thought to the exclusion of other matters which might be competing for attention. It may suggest a dedicated and voluntary concern for something: <I><FONT color=brown>preoccupied</FONT></I> with details of the merger plan. More often I suggests an excessive or involuntary brooding about something; so <I><FONT color=brown>preoccupied</FONT></I> with his career that he was neglectful of his family; indications that thoughts of suicide had <I><FONT color=brown>preoccupied</FONT></I> him for months. The word may also simply suggest a mind lost in haphazard thought of any kind whatsoever and, consequently, inattentive to the matter at hand: a clerk who met my question with a vacant and <I><FONT color=brown>preoccupied</FONT></I> stare.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Involved</FONT></B> pertains to commitment more than to concern, and it can be used for active behaviour as well as for mental states: students <I><FONT color=brown>involved</FONT></I> in the anti-conscription campaign; readers who can become deeply <I><FONT color=brown>involved</FONT></I> in the plot of a mystery thriller.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Absorbed</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>engrossed</FONT></B> contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>preoccupied</FONT></I> in being almost wholly positive in connotation. Both these words refer primarily to a voluntary, almost eager, attentiveness to, or interest in, something. <I><FONT color=brown>Engrossed</FONT></I> suggests complete and alert intellectual concentration: <I><FONT color=brown>engrossed</FONT></I> in studying the committee’s findings. <I><FONT color=brown>Absorbed</FONT></I> may suggest an emotional interest that is even more complete: utterly <I><FONT color=brown>absorbed</FONT></I> by the film’s slow unfolding. <I><FONT color=brown>Absorbed</FONT></I>, furthermore, may suggest an intensity of interest in one’s own activity; so <I><FONT color=brown>absorbed</FONT></I> in his own story that he failed to notice the growing restlessness among his listeners.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Busy">BUSY</A>, <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Oblivious">OBLIVIOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: distracted, <A href="entry://Uninvolved">UNINVOLVED</A>.</P>

<P>These words denote something given freely to a person, group or institution for use or pleasure. <B><FONT color=blue>Present</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>gift</FONT></B> are the most general words, and they are applied to anything, large or small, material or non-material, that is given without expectation of return or compensation. Present and gift may be used interchangeably to denote things bestowed upon another: a birthday <I><FONT color=brown>present</FONT></I>; a Christmas <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I>. However, <I><FONT color=brown>present</FONT></I> is a less formal word than gift and is more likely to be applied to things of nominal cost, while <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> may suggest a donation of considerable value. [Each child brought a <I><FONT color=brown>present</FONT></I> to the teacher; The foundation made a <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> of a million dollars to the university.] An admirable quality or talent which seems to have been bestowed miraculously by nature is also called a <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I>, but never a <I><FONT color=brown>present</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> of prophecy; a <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> for writing poetry.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Largess</FONT></B> is a somewhat pompous word for a bountiful <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> conferred in an ostentatious manner, often among many recipients. The word hints at condescension on the part of the giver and is often used ironically: an indifferent salesman who received orders through the <I><FONT color=brown>largess</FONT></I> of his wealthy uncle; the poor who live on the <I><FONT color=brown>largess</FONT></I> of public assistance.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>grant</FONT></B> is a <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> of money or its equivalent to a person or an institution to enable the recipient to accomplish a specific end: a <I><FONT color=brown>grant</FONT></I> to a scholar to do research; a <I><FONT color=brown>grant</FONT></I> to a university to purchase a computer. <I><FONT color=brown>Grants</FONT></I> commonly involve considerable sums and are often given by public authority: a <I><FONT color=brown>grant</FONT></I> of land to establish an agricultural college.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>bonus</FONT></B> is something paid or given in addition to what is usual or stipulated. An employer may give his staff a cash <I><FONT color=brown>bonus</FONT></I> at the end of the year, or he may reward a particularly valued employee with a <I><FONT color=brown>bonus</FONT></I> of an extra week’s holiday. A <I><FONT color=brown>bonus</FONT></I> is also a <I><FONT color=brown>grant</FONT></I>, as of money or insurance, to citizens who have rendered military service.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gratuity</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tip</FONT></B> both imply an unspecified sum of money given voluntarily in return for a service or the expectation of special attention. <I><FONT color=brown>Gratuity</FONT></I> is the more formal word and points to a more substantial <I><FONT color=brown>gift</FONT></I> than does <I><FONT color=brown>tip</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>tip</FONT></I> to a waiter or porter; a <I><FONT color=brown>gratuity</FONT></I> on retiring from the firm he had served faithfully for 30 years.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bequest">BEQUEST</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to something present in great quantities or something frequently met with. <B><FONT color=blue>Prevalent</FONT></B> may indicate a heavy incidence of something either in time or in place: ideas <I><FONT color=brown>prevalent</FONT></I> during the Renaissance; varieties of wildflowers that are <I><FONT color=brown>prevalent</FONT></I> in the Outback. The word most often suggests factual observation with out any attempt to evaluate the thing observed. <B><FONT color=blue>Prevailing</FONT></B> goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>prevalent</FONT></I> to suggest that the thing observed has existed and continues to exist in such quantity as to surpass any other kind of thing that might be compared to it. This may often be a matter of subjective evaluation: discussing what he regarded as the <I><FONT color=brown>prevailing</FONT></I> theme of the modern British novel. [While many forms of life are <I><FONT color=brown>prevalent</FONT></I> throughout the world, man and the insect are perhaps the two <I><FONT color=brown>prevailing</FONT></I> forms in nearly every habitat.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abundant</FONT></B>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>prevalent</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>prevailing</FONT></I>, is mostly restricted to observations about a particular place rather than a particular time: an <I><FONT color=brown>abundant</FONT></I> harvest; a cultural life that is more varied and <I><FONT color=brown>abundant</FONT></I> than in smaller towns. <I><FONT color=brown>Abundant</FONT></I> usually suggests a valued or desirable quantity, even though the word may occasionally suggest frequency to the point of excess. <B><FONT color=blue>Common</FONT></B>, by contrast, shades off to suggest something that by its very frequency becomes usual or ordinary: the <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> people; an experience <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> to every traveller. <I><FONT color=brown>Common</FONT></I>, furthermore, can apply to time as well as place, much like prevalent: a style of dress <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> in the 1890s. Neither <I><FONT color=brown>abundant</FONT></I> nor <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> suggests the notion of dominance present in <I><FONT color=brown>prevailing</FONT></I>. [Although revolutionary ideas were <I><FONT color=brown>abundant</FONT></I> and poverty was <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I>, the <I><FONT color=brown>prevailing</FONT></I> temper was one of sheer indifference.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rife</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>widespread</FONT></B> both emphasize aspects of <I><FONT color=brown>prevalent</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Rife</FONT></I> suggests the unchecked or unregulated spread of something: a time <I><FONT color=brown>rife</FONT></I> with conflicting theories of art and society; Bribery and corruption were <I><FONT color=brown>rife</FONT></I> in the local courts. As suggested by the last example, this word is frequently used to suggest a heavy incidence of something undesirable, thus making a sharp contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>abundant</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Widespread</FONT></I> most specifically refers to place rather than time, suggesting something that is not so much common as occurring over a large area: the <I><FONT color=brown>widespread</FONT></I> misconception that Darwin had argued that we were descended from apes; paperback publishers who have had a <I><FONT color=brown>widespread</FONT></I> effect on the country’s reading habits; tests to determine whether the cancer was <I><FONT color=brown>widespread</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Plentiful</FONT></B> relates, like abundant, to a desirable quantity or even a superfluity of something: a part of the country where work was <I><FONT color=brown>plentiful</FONT></I>; an island where edible fruit is so <I><FONT color=brown>plentiful</FONT></I> that it rots on the vine. <B><FONT color=blue>Copious</FONT></B> indicates an even greater quantity than <I><FONT color=brown>plentiful</FONT></I> and sometimes requires the interpolation of "supply of," "number of," etc., before the operative noun: The squirrel gathered a <I><FONT color=brown>copious</FONT></I> store of nuts. However, the interpolation is unnecessary when reference is made to a volume, outpouring, profusion, cascade or flow: His writings were <I><FONT color=brown>copious</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>copious</FONT></I> tears. <I><FONT color=brown>Copious</FONT></I> can also serve as a more formal intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>abundant</FONT></I>, sometimes indicating a superfluity: a <I><FONT color=brown>copious</FONT></I> harvest; a scholarly treatise with <I><FONT color=brown>copious</FONT></I> footnotes. <B><FONT color=blue>Ample</FONT></B>, in contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>copious</FONT></I>, means both just enough and more than enough, and so tends to imply an amount between enough and <I><FONT color=brown>plentiful</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>ample</FONT></I> but not generous servings; an <I><FONT color=brown>ample</FONT></I> income; <I><FONT color=brown>ample</FONT></I> room for a family of five. The word can also refer, in a humorous way, to generous or excessive size when used of a person: the matron’s <I><FONT color=brown>ample</FONT></I> bosom.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Generous">GENEROUS</A>, <A href="entry://Outstanding">OUTSTANDING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Occasional">OCCASIONAL</A>, <A href="entry://Scanty">SCANTY</A>.</P>

<P>These verbs mean to keep from happening or doing. <B><FONT color=blue>Prevent</FONT></B> is the comprehensive term for the group. Used of human agency, it implies precautionary or restraining measures taken to hinder, thwart or block a thing. These measures may involve forcible restraint. [Armed guards <I><FONT color=brown>prevented</FONT></I> us from entering the palace; They tied him up to <I><FONT color=brown>prevent</FONT></I> his escape.] The measures may be positive steps taken to ward off potential trouble: concessions and reforms made to <I><FONT color=brown>prevent</FONT></I> future riots; negotiations to <I><FONT color=brown>prevent</FONT></I> a stalemate; fabric waterproofed to <I><FONT color=brown>prevent</FONT></I> permeation by rain; it is easier to <I><FONT color=brown>prevent</FONT></I> illness than to cure it. <I><FONT color=brown>Prevent</FONT></I> is used also of a non-human agency or chance cause that acts as a hindrance; in such cases, only the effect of the agent is stressed and no motive is attributed to it. [Rain <I><FONT color=brown>prevented</FONT></I> us from going (or prevented our going) on the hike; A sprained ankle <I><FONT color=brown>prevented</FONT></I> him from playing in the game.] <B><FONT color=blue>Stop</FONT></B> in this sense is more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>prevent</FONT></I> and has greater immediacy. Where <I><FONT color=brown>prevent</FONT></I> often implies forethought and advance preparation to keep something from occurring, <I><FONT color=brown>stop</FONT></I> focuses completely on responsive action to the circumstance at hand. [I’m leaving, and don’t?try to <I><FONT color=brown>stop</FONT></I> me from going.] Further, <I><FONT color=brown>stop</FONT></I> may refer to the halting or ending of an action already in progress. [<I><FONT color=brown>Stop</FONT></I> him from hitting me; to <I><FONT color=brown>stop</FONT></I> an alarm from ringing; to <I><FONT color=brown>stop</FONT></I> a revolt by the use of armed force.] <I><FONT color=brown>Prevent</FONT></I>, which at first had only the anticipatory meaning, has come to apply also to the stopping of an action at any stage, with the implication that the ultimate consequences of the act have been avoided: The enemy passed the outworks and were barely <I><FONT color=brown>prevented</FONT></I> from capturing the fortress.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>preclude</FONT></B> is to prevent by anticipation or to rule out by necessity. This word is used not of persons but of events, circumstances, decisions or the like. It suggests a door shut in advance, as a consequence of a prior action, occurrence, choice or commitment. [Walls and bars <I><FONT color=brown>precluded</FONT></I> the possibility of escape; Our decision to holiday in New Zealand <I><FONT color=brown>precludes</FONT></I> our going to Fiji this year; Professional duties <I><FONT color=brown>precluded</FONT></I> the doctor from accepting the invitation.] <B><FONT color=blue>Forestall</FONT></B> is like preclude in emphasizing anticipation, but it implies a deliberate deterrent. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>preclude</FONT></I> points to circumstances that make an occurrence impossible, <I><FONT color=brown>forestall</FONT></I> involves the taking of preventive counter-measures in time to turn something aside or temper its effect. [He <I><FONT color=brown>forestalled</FONT></I> the anticipated criticism by confessing his faults of his own accord; She <I><FONT color=brown>forestalled</FONT></I> my question by bringing up the subject herself; In 1938, Australia decided to <I><FONT color=brown>stop</FONT></I> sending pig-iron to Japan to <I><FONT color=brown>forestall</FONT></I> increased unrest at home.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Avert</FONT></B>, more strongly and more specifically than <I><FONT color=brown>forestall</FONT></I>, implies the wording off of a threat or danger. It points to the taking of effective counter-measures just in time to keep something disastrous from happening. [He swerved sharply to the left and narrowly <I><FONT color=brown>averted</FONT></I> a collision; Police <I><FONT color=brown>averted</FONT></I> a riot by calming down the demonstrators at the scene of the disturbance.] <B><FONT color=blue>Obviate</FONT></B> is the most formal word in this set. It means to dispose of, referring to a risk, difficulty, objection or the like, which is met squarely and cleared out of the way. [A settlement out of court would <I><FONT color=brown>obviate</FONT></I> the need for a long-drawn-out lawsuit; travellers cheques to <I><FONT color=brown>obviate</FONT></I> the risk of lost or stolen cash.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Avoid">AVOID</A>, <A href="entry://Discourage">DISCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A> (arrest), <A href="entry://Thwart">THWART</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Effect">EFFECT</A>, facilitate, <A href="entry://Permit">PERMIT</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in denoting statements of fact or generality which are universally or widely considered to be true and fundamental. <B><FONT color=blue>Principle</FONT></B> has the greatest range of meaning of all the terms in this group, but in the context of this discrimination it refers to an elementary proposition held to be basic in any system or chain of reasoning, conduct or procedure: a theological <I><FONT color=brown>principle</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>principle</FONT></I> of self-government. In logic, an <B><FONT color=blue>assumption</FONT></B> specifically designates the minor or second premise in a syllogism. Less specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>assumption</FONT></I> refers to any assertion about reality which is unproved or debatable: the danger of basing scientific conclusions upon <I><FONT color=brown>assumption</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Axiom</FONT></B> originally denoted a proposition, usually one agreed upon as the basis of an argument or demonstration, whose truth was so self-evident as to be indisputable: using the <I><FONT color=brown>axiom</FONT></I> that every effect must have a cause to prove the existence of God. In current usage, <I><FONT color=brown>axiom</FONT></I> often indicates any <I><FONT color=brown>principle</FONT></I> that men universally receive and act upon as if it were true, rather than something deemed necessarily true. A <B><FONT color=blue>theorem</FONT></B> is a proposition that is not self-evident but that is susceptible to rational proof. Since <I><FONT color=brown>theorems</FONT></I> are deduced from <I><FONT color=brown>axioms</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>axioms</FONT></I> are often called first <I><FONT color=brown>principles</FONT></I>, and <I><FONT color=brown>theorems</FONT></I> are called secondary <I><FONT color=brown>principles</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Basis">BASIS</A>.</P>

privacy
<B><FONT color=blue>privacy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>isolation</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>seclusion</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>solitude</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>withdrawal</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to being alone with others or by oneself, without danger of being seen, overheard or interrupted. <B><FONT color=blue>Privacy</FONT></B> adds to this general meaning strongly positive overtones of freedom and intimacy, such as a person has in his own home, whether by himself, with his family or with chosen friends: eavesdropping devices that threaten the <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I> of the home; a court decision affirming a married couple’s right to <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I>. When used outside the context of the home, the word suggests conditions approaching this state, often presented as a luxury or added feature: the <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I> afforded by a box at the theatre; a large ward of the hospital that permitted the patients little <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I>; asking where they could go to talk in <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I>. In one of its senses, <B><FONT color=blue>seclusion</FONT></B> is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I>, suggesting a situation offering even greater protection from interference than one’s own home: preferring to work in the <I><FONT color=brown>seclusion</FONT></I> of his mountain retreat. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>seclusion</FONT></I> suggests surroundings that protect, separate or shield one from any sort of notice, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I> may give practical but not total protection: feeling free to talk in the <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I> of their railway compartment, though their <I><FONT color=brown>seclusion</FONT></I> was rendered incomplete by an uncovered window that looked directly out on to the corridor. In a more specialized and not necessarily positive sense, the word suggests a deliberate hiding from the outside world, either to meet with, evade or wait for someone: the grove of trees that gave <I><FONT color=brown>seclusion</FONT></I> to the lover’s lane; seeking <I><FONT color=brown>seclusion</FONT></I> from their enemy in the hidden cave; waiting to ambush him from the <I><FONT color=brown>seclusion</FONT></I> of the shadowed alley.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Isolation</FONT></B> can function like <I><FONT color=brown>seclusion</FONT></I>, but it can also stress the state of being completely cut off from the outside world, whether by compulsion, choice or circumstance: keeping the kidnapped family in <I><FONT color=brown>isolation</FONT></I> by removing them to a deserted farmhouse. As can be seen, <I><FONT color=brown>isolation</FONT></I> may suggest the condition of being utterly and involuntarily alone or cut off from others. While the previous pair of words can suggest freedom from interference or harm, only <I><FONT color=brown>isolation</FONT></I>, of the three, can suggest inaccessibility to help or aid. Less strictly taken, the word still refers more sternly to total exclusion of the external: hoping her friends would understand her insistence on complete <I><FONT color=brown>isolation</FONT></I> during the period of mourning; erratic ferry service that contributed to the island’s sense of <I><FONT color=brown>isolation</FONT></I> from the mainland; the <I><FONT color=brown>isolation</FONT></I> of the slums from the rest of the city.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Solitude</FONT></B> can be a more positive and high toned substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>isolation</FONT></I>, but mostly in the latter’s voluntary senses: longing for the off-season <I><FONT color=brown>solitude</FONT></I> of a seaside resort. In an extended sense, the word can refer more generally to the stillness or peacefulness of a setting: the lofty <I><FONT color=brown>solitude</FONT></I> of the mountain peaks. <B><FONT color=blue>Withdrawal</FONT></B> places its emphasis on an act rather than a state, stressing the voluntary removal of oneself from distraction or, less positively, the rejection of the outside world: his <I><FONT color=brown>withdrawal</FONT></I> each night into the <I><FONT color=brown>privacy</FONT></I> of his home; their self-preoccupied <I><FONT color=brown>withdrawal</FONT></I> into their own affairs. The movement suggested by the word need not be from public view into <I><FONT color=brown>seclusion</FONT></I> but from one place to anywhere else: a <I><FONT color=brown>withdrawal</FONT></I> from his home life into the concerns of his hectic office life. In a psychological sense, <I><FONT color=brown>withdrawal</FONT></I> has become a fad word for any indication of introversion or introspection, even extending to catatonic or autistic states: the boy’s <I><FONT color=brown>withdrawal</FONT></I> from the other students.</P><P>SEE; <A href="entry://Escape">ESCAPE</A>, <A href="entry://Leave">LEAVE</A>, <A href="entry://Loneliness">LONELINESS</A>, <A href="entry://Lonely">LONELY</A>, <A href="entry://Modest">MODEST</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: company, gregariousness, publicity.</P>

<P>These words refer to the postponing of a duty or to the leisurely, aimless passing of time. <B><FONT color=blue>Procrastinate</FONT></B> and stall both emphasize the putting off of serious questions, but stall can suggest any sort of delay to gain time, whereas procrastinate suggests occupying oneself with other, often trivial, matters. Stall, furthermore, can indicate a brief pause, as before answering a question, while <I><FONT color=brown>procrastinate</FONT></I>, by contrast, indicates the protracted dragging out or delaying of something over a longer time. [His hemming and hawing was only a ruse to stall the reporters before answering their biting questions; When faced with a deadline on a term paper, she lolls about on her bed, daydreams, goes to a theatre of does anything she can think of to <I><FONT color=brown>procrastinate</FONT></I> a little longer.] Stall can, however, refer to a longer delay, in which case it suggests greater ill will than <I><FONT color=brown>procrastinate</FONT></I>: legislation stalled in a series of committee meetings.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dawdle</FONT></B> may refer to a kind of <I><FONT color=brown>procrastinating</FONT></I> in which a given duty is pursued half-heartedly and phlegmatically rather than put off or put aside: She knew that if she <I><FONT color=brown>dawdled</FONT></I> over the dishes, her mother would take over in a fit of exasperation and do them herself. But the word may refer also to a leisurely passing of time, with no sense whatever of postponing a duty: In the hour between trains, the <I><FONT color=brown>dawdled</FONT></I> about in a bookshop near the station. <B><FONT color=blue>Tarry</FONT></B> means to hang behind or to stray off course; a deliberate act of procrastinating may be implied: Don’t <I><FONT color=brown>tarry</FONT></I> on your way home from school. But he word now more often applies to aimless or leisurely stops along a course: a couple who decided to <I><FONT color=brown>tarry</FONT></I> another week in the lovely seaside resort. Now the word can sometimes sound quaint or affected.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Loiter</FONT></B> indicates standing about aimlessly or moving from place to place in a slow, rambling way: No <I><FONT color=brown>loitering</FONT></I> in these premises; a tourist who <I><FONT color=brown>loitered</FONT></I> about he town square, browsing through several of the shops. The word seldom suggests the delaying of a task, although legally it can refer to a misdemeanour and, hence, can suggest an improper or sinister motive. <B><FONT color=blue>Lag</FONT></B> can suggest something that lacks impetus or falls behind a desirable rate of progress: when interest in the civic-centre project began to <I><FONT color=brown>lag</FONT></I>; a theory that man’s social consciousness has <I><FONT color=brown>lagged</FONT></I> behind his technological accomplishments. The word may be used in a more literal way, without the disapproval inherent in the previous examples: a fifteen-mile hike during which those with blistered feet began to <I><FONT color=brown>lag</FONT></I> behind the others.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shilly-shally</FONT></B> suggests an evasive tactic of stalling for time or an attempt to avoid taking a stand: He was not one to <I><FONT color=brown>shilly-shally</FONT></I> when he disagreed with the findings of his colleagues. Most simply, the word can indicate any weak, vacillating or <I><FONT color=brown>procrastinating</FONT></I> behaviour: They <I><FONT color=brown>shilly-shallied</FONT></I> about technicalities while the bushfire raged out of control. <B><FONT color=blue>Dally</FONT></B> can indicate the leisurely passage of time where no postponing of duty is implied: a holiday in which they could <I><FONT color=brown>dally</FONT></I> as long as they wished in any city they found to their liking. <I><FONT color=brown>Dally</FONT></I> can also add a special note of pleasurably relaxed and even amorous dawdling, influenced by a related use of the word: guests at the party who had <I><FONT color=brown>dallied</FONT></I> with the young woman. More disapprovingly and with no note of playfulness, the word can indicate an indecisive wasting of time: housewives who <I><FONT color=brown>dally</FONT></I> over the pre-packaged cuts of meat in self-service supermarkets. <I><FONT color=brown>Dilly-dally</FONT></I>, an alternate form, more readily suggests sheer procrastinating: he <I><FONT color=brown>dilly-dallied</FONT></I> over what film to see until it was too late to go to any of them.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hesitate">HESITATE</A>, <A href="entry://Postpone">POSTPONE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: decide, persevere, push on, <A href="entry://Quicken">QUICKEN</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to crude or foul language. <B><FONT color=blue>Profanity</FONT></B> emphasizes abusive vituperation or rage expressed in irreverent use of religious terms and names applied to the deity. More loosely, <I><FONT color=brown>profanity</FONT></I> may be used as the general term for any sort of habitually foul language: the <I><FONT color=brown>profanity</FONT></I> endemic to army life. <B><FONT color=blue>Blasphemy</FONT></B>, a stronger term than <I><FONT color=brown>profanity</FONT></I>, as applied to choice of language, is restricted specifically to an irreverent use of religious terms, especially the name of the deity; this may be done as a habitual mannerism of speech, to shock others, or to insult a particular person, as with <I><FONT color=brown>profanity</FONT></I>: the common <I><FONT color=brown>profanity</FONT></I> of the fo’c’s'le peppered with lewd remarks and casual <I><FONT color=brown>blasphemies</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cursing</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>swearing</FONT></B> may be used loosely as general terms for crude language, but each has a more precise reference. <I><FONT color=brown>Cursing</FONT></I> refers specifically to phrases that would call down misfortunes on someone or something: the fit of <I><FONT color=brown>cursing</FONT></I> with which he punished each person who refused him the price of a beer. <I><FONT color=brown>Swearing</FONT></I> most specifically refers to <I><FONT color=brown>cursing</FONT></I> that is reinforced by an appeal to a deity to carry out the wish expressed. It is thus a specific form of <I><FONT color=brown>blasphemy</FONT></I> as well.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Obscenity</FONT></B> refers to that element in coarse language that is lewd or suggestive in reference to sexual matters: calling out <I><FONT color=brown>obscenities</FONT></I> to every unaccompanied girl who passed the corner. <B><FONT color=blue>Vulgarity</FONT></B> is milder than <I><FONT color=brown>obscenity</FONT></I>, indicating reference to normally unmentioned bodily processes: speech larded with scatological <I><FONT color=brown>vulgarities</FONT></I>. In an even milder use, <I><FONT color=brown>vulgarity</FONT></I> may refer merely to blunt, tasteless or even ungrammatical language: disc jockeys who take crash courses to rid their speech of common <I><FONT color=brown>vulgarities</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bad language</FONT></B> is a common euphemism for all the above words and thus has the force of none of them: Police alleged the man was drunk and used <I><FONT color=brown>bad language</FONT></I> in front of the other guests.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Curse">CURSE</A>, <A href="entry://Desecration">DESECRATION</A>, <A href="entry://Curse">MALEDICTION</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the long-term duties that someone takes on as a livelihood or as his main interest in life. <B><FONT color=blue>Profession</FONT></B> suggests a position that cannot be attained without a considerable amount of higher education, and that involves one creatively in mental rather than manual labour. Once the word referred mainly to the three learned <I><FONT color=brown>professions</FONT></I> ?law, medicine and theology ?but it is now often used to confer status upon many other ways of earning a livelihood: the teaching <I><FONT color=brown>profession</FONT></I>; the acting <I><FONT color=brown>profession</FONT></I>; making his friends mostly among other members of the plumbing <I><FONT color=brown>profession</FONT></I>. Even when <I><FONT color=brown>profession</FONT></I> is used more strictly, it need not suggest dedication on the part of a given member. By contrast, one sense of <B><FONT color=blue>vocation</FONT></B> specifically stresses this dedication: finding early that he had a <I><FONT color=brown>vocation</FONT></I> for the ministry, though he ended up the legal <I><FONT color=brown>profession</FONT></I> instead. Moreover, <I><FONT color=brown>vocation</FONT></I> stresses a long-term commitment to something that is not necessarily equated with the earning of a livelihood: choosing painting as his <I><FONT color=brown>vocation</FONT></I> and earning his keep by working as a waiter. Less specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>vocation</FONT></I> can be merely a neutral reference to one’s form of employment; as such, it may or may not include the <I><FONT color=brown>professions</FONT></I>, but in any case it can sound euphemistic or ostentatious when so used: calling together a representative sampling of people from all walks of life and from every <I><FONT color=brown>profession</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>vocation</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Occupation</FONT></B> is exclusively restricted to this last neutral possibility for vocation, though <I><FONT color=brown>occupation</FONT></I> completely escapes the danger of sounding over-elegant or euphemistic: drawn from <I><FONT color=brown>occupations</FONT></I> as diverse as medicine and carpentry.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Trade</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>work</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>job</FONT></B> by contrast may suggest a range of occupations from skilled labour to the most menial of positions. Of the three, <I><FONT color=brown>trade</FONT></I> implies the dignity of learned skills in which inventiveness and manual labour are combined: programmes designed to teach early school-leavers a <I><FONT color=brown>trade</FONT></I>; the building <I><FONT color=brown>trades</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Work</FONT></I> is, of course, very general, and can apply to any sort of effort: the <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> of raising a child. In a professional context, it suggests the set hours of long-term employment: getting to <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> on time. Less specifically, it can point to a <I><FONT color=brown>vocation</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>occupation</FONT></I> in general: asking him what sort of <I><FONT color=brown>work</FONT></I> he did. <I><FONT color=brown>Job</FONT></I> is commonly used to refer to any sort of gainful employment, whether permanent or temporary: hunting for a summer <I><FONT color=brown>job</FONT></I>; getting <I><FONT color=brown>jobs</FONT></I> for the unemployed. The word ranges in application from a single task or piece of work to a regular position of employment. It may suggest either skilled or unskilled labour, for its commonness gives it informal currency in any context: the <I><FONT color=brown>job</FONT></I> of turning out first-rate psychiatrists; an editorial <I><FONT color=brown>job</FONT></I> with a publishing house; to do a good <I><FONT color=brown>job</FONT></I> of mowing the lawn.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Field</FONT></B> is an informal and <B><FONT color=blue>specialization</FONT></B> a formal word for referring to smaller groupings within <I><FONT color=brown>occupations</FONT></I>: a medical student who intended to study in the <I><FONT color=brown>field</FONT></I> of obstetrics; a general knowledge of law but with a <I><FONT color=brown>specialization</FONT></I> in divorce cases.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artisan">ARTISAN</A>, <A href="entry://Labour">LABOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Labourer">LABOURER</A>, <A href="entry://Stint">STINT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to academic positions or duties germane to higher education. They are the terms most frequently met but may change from university to university in both use and the status implied, even within Australia and New Zealand. Overseas universities may use some of these terms quite differently. <B><FONT color=blue>Professors</FONT></B> are the highest-ranking teachers in a university and have tenure by virtue of status and qualifications within a teaching or research department. <B><FONT color=blue>Associate-professor</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>reader</FONT></B> are the next most senior positions and are usually held by persons with high qualifications in teaching, administration or research. An <I><FONT color=brown>associate-professor</FONT></I> is often in charge of some important part of a department’s activities. Of no less standing, and with some prestige on account of his rarity, is a <I><FONT color=brown>reader</FONT></I>, who is usually an exceptional scholar in some aspect of his subject; he is much more concerned with research and less with administration and large-scale teaching than the <I><FONT color=brown>associate-professor</FONT></I>.</P><P>Another rank, gaining in use, is that of <B><FONT color=blue>director</FONT></B>, who usually has salary and responsibility comparable with an <I><FONT color=brown>associate-professor’s</FONT></I>, but his not the same academic prestige. Such a person has considerable responsibility in the management of large numbers of students in a big university department, for example, as <I><FONT color=brown>director</FONT></I> of first- and second-year studies.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lecturer</FONT></B> is the rank of the experienced university teacher who instructs by means of formal addresses with limited free exchange with his listeners. A <B><FONT color=blue>tutor</FONT></B>, who is of lower status than a <I><FONT color=brown>lecturer</FONT></I>, and usually of lower academic attainment, is more concerned with instruction to small groups on certain sections of a course, and always under the direction of a senior teacher. Some departments such as the scientific or technical disciplines have <B><FONT color=blue>demonstrators</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>tutor-demonstrator</FONT></B> to do similar directed work, usually in a laboratory. In universities which employ <I><FONT color=brown>lecturers</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>tutors</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>demonstrators</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>tutor-demonstrators</FONT></I>, there is usually opportunity to progress by promotion to senior positions in these categories. All these appointments may be temporary or part-time, but tenure is usually permanent.</P><P>Some universities have he positions of assistant-<I><FONT color=brown>lecturer</FONT></I> or junior-<I><FONT color=brown>lecturer</FONT></I> for inexperienced but academically well-qualified graduates. Most of these may have only a first degree but, with the passing of time and the attainment of higher qualifications, they would expect to move to <I><FONT color=brown>lecturer</FONT></I> and senior <I><FONT color=brown>lecturer</FONT></I> or higher positions. At most universities the <B><FONT color=blue>teaching fellow</FONT></B> is the first step for a budding university teacher; he may take classes in the field of his special interest or assist in administration in his department, while proceeding with his own study and research.</P><P>Instead of taking a <I><FONT color=brown>teaching fellowship</FONT></I>, a good graduate may obtain a <B><FONT color=blue>research-student</FONT></B> position, which means he will concentrate on working for a higher-degree. In some universities these are <B><FONT color=blue>research fellows</FONT></B> or senior <I><FONT color=brown>research fellows</FONT></I> who are usually experienced academics devoting time essentially to research while holding some grant or scholarship award. A <B><FONT color=blue>graduate assistant</FONT></B> is not usually an outstanding scholar, but is employed to assist a responsible, usually senior, university teacher, or a particular department, in research or administrative work. All this is done under direction and no part is taken in teaching or other academic activities.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Don</FONT></B> is almost exclusively a British term, sometimes used rather loosely like academic or scholar, but more precisely indicating any fellow or tutor in a university or university college. The basic instruction by these teachers is to small groups or by individual tuition.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Learning">LEARNING</A>, <A href="entry://Teach">TEACH</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to a declaration that something must not be done or to an action which prevents something from being done. To <B><FONT color=blue>prohibit</FONT></B> is to give some formal command against or, more specifically, to make some authoritative legal enactment against. There is in <I><FONT color=brown>prohibit</FONT></I> a definite implication of readiness to use such force as may be needed to give effect to the enactment: In our city, smoking in theatres is <I><FONT color=brown>prohibited</FONT></I> by law. <B><FONT color=blue>Forbid</FONT></B> is a less formal word than <I><FONT color=brown>prohibit</FONT></I>, and suggests a personal relationship between the people involved in the <I><FONT color=brown>forbidding</FONT></I>: her mother <I><FONT color=brown>forbade</FONT></I> the little girl to have the house before she had finished her homework.</P><P>The rest of the words in this group are less general than <I><FONT color=brown>prohibit</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>forbid</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Ban</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>interdict</FONT></B> suggest prohibiting by ecclesiastical or civil authority. <I><FONT color=brown>Interdict</FONT></I> is chiefly known for its ecclesiastical use: to <I><FONT color=brown>interdict</FONT></I> the administration of the sacraments to a heretical group. <I><FONT color=brown>Ban</FONT></I> frequently implies moral condemnation or disapproval, and often refers to an object or work of art rather than to an action or practice: The film became an enormous box-office success because the book had been <I><FONT color=brown>banned</FONT></I> on the grounds of obscenity. <B><FONT color=blue>Debar</FONT></B> means to shut out or exclude, as from some place or condition. It hints strongly at the action of an irresistible authority or inner necessity: His plea of insanity was <I><FONT color=brown>debarred</FONT></I> by his own admissions. <B><FONT color=blue>Enjoin</FONT></B> has specific application to legal contexts. It means to prohibit or command by judicial order or injunction: waterside workers who were <I><FONT color=brown>enjoined</FONT></I> from striking.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Command">COMMAND</A>, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Endorse">ENDORSE</A>, <A href="entry://Permit">PERMIT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the execution of a systematic plan for realizing an explicit objective. <B><FONT color=blue>Project</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>programme</FONT></B> might both seem to refer literally to a proposed plan rather than one being carried out, but in actual usage these words can apply to such a plan at any stage of its existence, from conception to completion. <I><FONT color=brown>Project</FONT></I> is the more general of the two words and can apply equally well to the planned task of a single person or to such a task involving a number of people: a <I><FONT color=brown>project</FONT></I> to teach himself French at weekends; the government’s highway-construction <I><FONT color=brown>project</FONT></I>. The word is often used to refer to the end result of such work, long after its planning and completion: the six-block housing <I><FONT color=brown>project</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Programme</FONT></I> is more formal and more abstract than <I><FONT color=brown>project</FONT></I> and applies most often to group work. Where <I><FONT color=brown>project</FONT></I> might suggest a single self-contained objective often requiring physical labour, <I><FONT color=brown>programme</FONT></I> can suggest a more complex set of such <I><FONT color=brown>projects</FONT></I> or the application of largely mental or administrative effort: a regional development <I><FONT color=brown>programme</FONT></I> that would involve a number of local <I><FONT color=brown>projects</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Activity</FONT></B> is the most general of these words. While it need not suggest any plan or objective at all, it is often used to refer to the work done on a <I><FONT color=brown>project</FONT></I> or carried out by a group. It stresses the actual carrying out of something that simply continues without any point of completion: kindergartens that emphasize unprogrammed play time <I><FONT color=brown>activity</FONT></I>. University students who neglect their studies for extra-curricular <I><FONT color=brown>activities</FONT></I>; community centres offering such <I><FONT color=brown>activities</FONT></I> as language classes, art courses and dancing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Operation</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>activity</FONT></I> in its generality, suggesting continuing motion without necessarily implying the possibility of completion: studying the <I><FONT color=brown>operation</FONT></I> of the arbitration courts. It has come to have a special use in reference to a complex <I><FONT color=brown>programme</FONT></I> designed to achieve a clearly defined goal; this use, borrowed from the military, follows the capitalized word with a colourful epithet: <I><FONT color=brown>Operation</FONT></I> Crossbow.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Enterprise</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>undertaking</FONT></B> are the most formal of these words. <I><FONT color=brown>Enterprise</FONT></I> may suggest improvisation towards a less clearly defined goal and may imply an element of risk; it may also suggest boldness and strenuous endeavour: a perilous <I><FONT color=brown>enterprise</FONT></I> that few thought could succeed. On the other hand, it may simply refer to any business activity. [Watch-making and banking are the chief <I><FONT color=brown>enterprises</FONT></I> of the country.] <I><FONT color=brown>Undertaking</FONT></I> is more general than <I><FONT color=brown>enterprise</FONT></I>, but unlike activity it suggests both considerable forethought and the possibility of completion: agreeing to the <I><FONT color=brown>undertaking</FONT></I> only after exhaustive discussion of other alternatives. It can sometimes sound like an unnecessarily fancy substitute for one of its less formal synonyms.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Build">BUILD</A>, <A href="entry://Create">CREATE</A>, <A href="entry://Labour">LABOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Make">MAKE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the generation or application of force to move a thing onwards or away. <B><FONT color=blue>Propel</FONT></B> is the most general word, referring to the act of driving someone or something forward by whatever means: hurried along and <I><FONT color=brown>propelled</FONT></I> through a revolving door. The word is most often used of a mechanical force or a separate source of power: an explosive that <I><FONT color=brown>propels</FONT></I> a projectile from a gun, a fuel that serves to propel a missile or a rocket; a boat <I><FONT color=brown>propelled</FONT></I> by stream or by an outboard motor.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Push</FONT></B> generally implies physical contact between the mover and the moved. It specifically indicates force or pressure exerted on or against one side of an object to move it forwards, in the opposite direction or out of the way. The force employed may be slight or considerable: to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> a pram; to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> a stalled car. Applied to persons, <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> often implies impatience and consequent rudeness: to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> ahead of someone at a counter. The word has many shades of meaning depending on context: to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> a reluctant parachutist out of a plane; to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> a person off a diving board. <B><FONT color=blue>Shove</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> but is generally a stronger word, implying a greater or more abrupt measure of forcible pressure or physical effort: to <I><FONT color=brown>shove</FONT></I> a boat away from shore with a pole. More often than <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>shove</FONT></I> indicates exertion, as in <I><FONT color=brown>pushing</FONT></I> a heavy object along a surface: to <I><FONT color=brown>shove</FONT></I> a boat into the water. Or, used of persons, it may imply greater belligerence or determination than <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I>, emphasizing rough haste or blunt rudeness in pushing insistently: <I><FONT color=brown>shoving</FONT></I> everyone aside, elbowing and jostling his way to the front. <I><FONT color=brown>Push</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>shove</FONT></I> are often used together: peak-hour travellers <I><FONT color=brown>pushing</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>shoving</FONT></I> in bus queues.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>thrust</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> suddenly and forcibly, as on impulse or because of some stimulus. [The child <I><FONT color=brown>thrust</FONT></I> out his hand, asking for sweets; Shy and embarrassed, the boy <I><FONT color=brown>thrust</FONT></I> the flowers at his girl friend; Othello, in a jealous rage, <I><FONT color=brown>thrust</FONT></I> Desdemona aside.] Unlike the other words, <I><FONT color=brown>thrust</FONT></I> often specifically implies a putting of one thing into another. It may mean to put a person forcibly into some situation: to <I><FONT color=brown>thrust</FONT></I> a prisoner into a cell; to <I><FONT color=brown>thrust</FONT></I> an unwilling child on to the stage. Or it may refer to the act of <I><FONT color=brown>pushing</FONT></I> into something with a sharp or pointed instrument: to <I><FONT color=brown>thrust</FONT></I> a pin into one’s skin; a matador who <I><FONT color=brown>thrusts</FONT></I> a sword into a bull. In an extended sense, it can mean to have anything forced upon one against one’s will: Unwanted publicity was <I><FONT color=brown>thrust</FONT></I> upon him when he won the prize.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Press</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>urge</FONT></B>, in this context, point to an outward influence that <I><FONT color=brown>propels</FONT></I> one towards a goal. <I><FONT color=brown>Urge</FONT></I> may be used of physical force: to <I><FONT color=brown>urge</FONT></I> a horse on with a whip or with spurs. More often, however, <I><FONT color=brown>urge</FONT></I> indicates not force but strong persuasion, the psychological exertion of a prompting or impelling influence: He <I><FONT color=brown>urged</FONT></I> them to accept the plan. <I><FONT color=brown>Press</FONT></I> refers almost entirely to psychological stress. It is stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>urge</FONT></I> in implying greater insistence and urgency, with overtones of demand: <I><FONT color=brown>pressing</FONT></I> them to meet the deadline; He <I><FONT color=brown>pressed</FONT></I> me for an answer; <I><FONT color=brown>pressing</FONT></I> hard for needed reforms. <I><FONT color=brown>Push</FONT></I> is used figuratively in a similar way, meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>press</FONT></I> persistently or to promote or advocate vigorously: to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> for a change in the law; to <I><FONT color=brown>push</FONT></I> a new line of goods.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impel">IMPEL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Discourage">DISCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Pull">PULL</A>, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to preserve from harm, injury or attack. <B><FONT color=blue>Protect</FONT></B> is the most general term. It suggests from its etymology the providing of a covering or other barrier to ward off harm: to <I><FONT color=brown>protect</FONT></I> one’s hands from the cold with warm gloves; to <I><FONT color=brown>protect</FONT></I> a country from surprise attack by means of an air-raid-warning system. <B><FONT color=blue>Guard</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>protect</FONT></I> with extreme care and watchfulness against actual or potential danger: to <I><FONT color=brown>guard</FONT></I> a prisoner; security police who <I><FONT color=brown>guard</FONT></I> the Prime Minister; to <I><FONT color=brown>guard</FONT></I> against hurting someone’s feelings.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shield</FONT></B> suggests even more strongly than <I><FONT color=brown>protect</FONT></I> that something, as in the manner of a knight’s <I><FONT color=brown>shield</FONT></I>, is placed between that which is to be <I><FONT color=brown>protected</FONT></I> and the source of anticipated harm or injury: to <I><FONT color=brown>shield</FONT></I> one’s face from blows with an upraised arm; <I><FONT color=brown>shielding</FONT></I> one’s eyes from strong light; over-protective parents who <I><FONT color=brown>shield</FONT></I> their children from disappointment or failure.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Safeguard</FONT></B> implies that danger is not yet present and may even be remote, but that planning against its eventuality is prudent and farseeing. [Vaccination <I><FONT color=brown>safeguards</FONT></I> us from smallpox; Saving money regularly during one’s working years will help to <I><FONT color=brown>safeguard</FONT></I> one’s old age from want.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Defend</FONT></B> emphasizes present danger and means to <I><FONT color=brown>protect</FONT></I> by the use of force or other counter-measures. [The Anzacs fought to <I><FONT color=brown>defend</FONT></I> our liberties; Every child must learn to <I><FONT color=brown>defend</FONT></I> himself, when necessary, against the bullying of other children.] By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>defend</FONT></I> means also to uphold or vindicate actions, opinions, decisions, etc., against censure, punishment or unfriendly criticism: to <I><FONT color=brown>defend</FONT></I> one’s right to hold certain political views; to <I><FONT color=brown>defend</FONT></I> the reputation of a wrongly accused man; a lawyer <I><FONT color=brown>defending</FONT></I> his client in court. <I><FONT color=brown>Defend</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>guard</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>shield</FONT></I> are not as complete in indicating success in warding off harm as is <I><FONT color=brown>protect</FONT></I>. One may <I><FONT color=brown>guard</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>shield</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>defend</FONT></I> a person or thing in vain, but that which one <I><FONT color=brown>protects</FONT></I> tends to be secure and safe.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shelter</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>harbour</FONT></B> both mean to <I><FONT color=brown>protect</FONT></I> by offering or by simply being a place of refuge or safety. <I><FONT color=brown>Shelter</FONT></I> is usually applied to providing cover from inclement weather or actual physical danger or attack. [<I><FONT color=brown>Sheltered</FONT></I> from harsh weather and natural enemies in his mother’s pouch, the baby kangaroo waits until he is big enough to venture out on his own; they were <I><FONT color=brown>sheltered</FONT></I> from the rifle fire by a huge boulder.] <I><FONT color=brown>Shelter</FONT></I> can also, as does <I><FONT color=brown>shield</FONT></I>, convey the idea of <I><FONT color=brown>protecting</FONT></I> in a manner that serves to inhibit or keep in a state of ignorance: The Victorians believed in <I><FONT color=brown>sheltering</FONT></I> young girls and women from sexual knowledge and from other "evils." <I><FONT color=brown>Harbour</FONT></I> almost always has connotations that are unfavourable or that may even suggest illegality improperly sterilized operating rooms that harbour germs; to <I><FONT color=brown>harbour</FONT></I> a fugitive from justice. In its figurative use, <I><FONT color=brown>harbour</FONT></I> points to a cherishing in the mind, often secretly, of thoughts, motivations, plans, etc., that are unacceptable or hostile: to <I><FONT color=brown>harbour</FONT></I> grudges; to <I><FONT color=brown>harbour</FONT></I> a ruthless ambition that in due time may be realized.</P><P>SEE; <A href="entry://Nurse">NURSE</A>, <A href="entry://Pamper">PAMPER</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Attack">ATTACK</A>, <A href="entry://Plunder">PLUNDER</A>.</P>

<P>These words are alike in denoting a place where one is guarded or defended from attack or injury; they are used also to designate the condition of safety or security which such a place provides. <B><FONT color=blue>Protection</FONT></B> is the most general and widely applied word in this group. It can refer to anything that shields from harm or destruction. [A strong defence system offers <I><FONT color=brown>protection</FONT></I> from sudden attack by an enemy; wire screens provide <I><FONT color=brown>protection</FONT></I> from mosquitoes.] <B><FONT color=blue>Shelter</FONT></B> usually connotes temporary <I><FONT color=brown>protection</FONT></I>, as from exposure to the elements: an awning under which we found <I><FONT color=brown>shelter</FONT></I> during the shower. <B><FONT color=blue>Refuge</FONT></B> suggests the safety one seeks when one is threatened or when one has escaped from danger or distress: a prisoner on the run who took <I><FONT color=brown>refuge</FONT></I> in an abandoned shack. Figuratively <I><FONT color=brown>refuge</FONT></I> refers to any expedient which is used to proved safety or defence: His final <I><FONT color=brown>refuge</FONT></I> was a web of lies and deceit. Both <I><FONT color=brown>refuge</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>shelter</FONT></I> are used to denote places in which the homeless may find some care and charity Salvation Army <I><FONT color=brown>shelter</FONT></I>; aimless men huddled together in the city <I><FONT color=brown>refuge</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Cover</FONT></B> is <I><FONT color=brown>protection</FONT></I> which affords safety through concealment. It can be the natural <I><FONT color=brown>shelter</FONT></I> of trees or bushes used by wild animals: Take <I><FONT color=brown>cover</FONT></I> in the barn as soon as you hear gunfire. It can be a military tactic used by troops, vessels, etc.: Most Allied landings in World War II would not have been possible without continuous air <I><FONT color=brown>cover</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Asylum</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sanctuary</FONT></B> are related in meaning. <I><FONT color=brown>Asylum</FONT></I> originally designated the inviolable <I><FONT color=brown>refuge</FONT></I> from arrest or punishment offered by the temple in ancient times; <I><FONT color=brown>sanctuary</FONT></I> was the later Christian equivalent. Today such immunity from arrest, punishment or persecution is fixed by national boundaries rather than by those of a church or temple. <I><FONT color=brown>Asylum</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>sanctuary</FONT></I> are, therefore, most often applied to the <I><FONT color=brown>protection</FONT></I> offered to a political refugee by a foreign country or its diplomatic official: A dictator deposed by a successful revolution may find <I><FONT color=brown>asylum</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>sanctuary</FONT></I>) in another country. <I><FONT color=brown>Sanctuary</FONT></I>, by extension, has come to refer also to those areas set apart for the <I><FONT color=brown>protection</FONT></I> and preservation of wildlife: a bird <I><FONT color=brown>sanctuary</FONT></I>.</P><P>SEE; <A href="entry://Escape">ESCAPE</A>, <A href="entry://Protect">PROTECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aggression">AGGRESSION</A>, <A href="entry://Danger">DANGER</A>, distress, harm, hurt, injury.</P>

<P>These words refer to the representative, ideal or earliest form of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Prototype</FONT></B> indicates the first example of a type from which other examples are developed or on which they are modelled: the anthropoid <I><FONT color=brown>prototype</FONT></I> of modern man; The Homeric epics became the <I><FONT color=brown>prototypes</FONT></I> upon which Virgil, Milton and other based their epic poems. The word can indicate also the first full-scale model of something: the <I><FONT color=brown>prototype</FONT></I> of his plan for urban housing projects, built to demonstrate its advantages.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pattern</FONT></B> can apply to the plans for a product rather than to the <I><FONT color=brown>prototype</FONT></I> or the later creations made from its specifications; often, it suggests blueprints or templates to be followed in constructing the product: new dress <I><FONT color=brown>patterns</FONT></I> on sale. More generally, the word indicates the design or configuration that something takes in actuality: the <I><FONT color=brown>pattern</FONT></I> of imagery in <I><FONT color=brown>Hamlet</FONT></I> that pertains to bodily injury and disease; <I><FONT color=brown>patterns</FONT></I> of culture. But the word can refer also to the perfect representative of a type, or to any example thought worthy of emulation: Castiglione was the very <I><FONT color=brown>pattern</FONT></I> of the Renaissance courtier.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Original</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>prototype</FONT></I> in distinguishing the first or genuine product from copies or later versions: She typed an <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I> and two carbons; a painting that proved to be copied from an <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I> in the Louvre; a close comparison of the two dresses, one a signed <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I>, the other a mass-produced copy; a collation of all manuscript copies with the <I><FONT color=brown>original</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Urtext</FONT></B>, the most restricted of these words, is adopted from the German and refers to the earliest version of a literary work, whether written or printed and whether extant or not: an argument that presupposed a vanished <I><FONT color=brown>Urtext</FONT></I> of the play upon which the existing version is modelled.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Archetype</FONT></B> also refer to the earliest version of a literary work; in this case, it refers strictly to a manuscript that no longer exists: possible to reconstruct the <I><FONT color=brown>archetype</FONT></I> from the variety of incomplete copies in existence. <I><FONT color=brown>Archetype</FONT></I> refers much more widely to the abstract conception of a perfect type. In Platonism, <I><FONT color=brown>archetypes</FONT></I> are the general or pure forms of which existing things are imperfect copies: for Plato, all chairs, however varying in design, can be said to reflect in their "chair-ness" the same <I><FONT color=brown>archetype</FONT></I>, just as there are <I><FONT color=brown>archetypes</FONT></I> for justice, goodness and such institutions as a republic. A modern redefinition of <I><FONT color=brown>archetype</FONT></I> was initiated by Jung to refer to those forms and symbols in the unconscious of all men that theoretically reflect the past history of the species: a myth that deals with <I><FONT color=brown>archetypes</FONT></I> of guilt, death, redemption and rebirth. More loosely, the word can refer to the quintessential elements that something contains: recurrent <I><FONT color=brown>archetypes</FONT></I> of conflict and resolution that can be seen in the living <I><FONT color=brown>patterns</FONT></I> of every family unit. <I><FONT color=brown>Prototype</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>archetype</FONT></I> are sometimes loosely substituted for each other, but, strictly speaking, <I><FONT color=brown>prototype</FONT></I> suggests an early, possibly unrefined version that later versions may reflect but depart from; <I><FONT color=brown>archetype</FONT></I>, by contrast, suggests a perfect and unchanging form, real or imaginary, that existing things can more or less approach, but never equal. <B><FONT color=blue>Ideal</FONT></B> is a much simpler word for some of the meanings indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>archetype</FONT></I>. Sometimes it means simply "the best possible": it was <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I> weather for tennis. But it usually suggests an imagined perfection, formulated as a goal to strive for or as a measure against which to test something that exists: describing his <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I> of what a city should be like and comparing this to the actual monstrosities that the trend to urbanization has produced. As can be seen, <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I> may indicate a personal rather than universal set of desirable qualities, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>archetype</FONT></I> refers to what is generally and invariably true of all examples, at least in essence. <I><FONT color=brown>Ideal</FONT></I> can also point hyperbolically to an instance seen as an embodiment of perfection: He was her <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I> of all that was manly. <B><FONT color=blue>Exemplar</FONT></B> concentrates exclusively on this last possibility of <I><FONT color=brown>ideal</FONT></I>, pointing to an instance that seems the perfect realization of its type: a soprano who was the <I><FONT color=brown>exemplar</FONT></I> of the prima donna at her most grandiose and temperamental.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Arise">ARISE</A>, <A href="entry://Form">FORM</A>, <A href="entry://Kind">KIND</A>, <A href="entry://Native">NATIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Copy">COPY</A>, <A href="entry://Counterpart">COUNTERPART</A>, <A href="entry://Duplicate">DUPLICATE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote various forms of brief expression of what are supposed to be accepted truths. A <B><FONT color=blue>proverb</FONT></B> is a homely illustration of a general truth and is couched and practical terms, as in "A fool and his money are soon parted." An <B><FONT color=blue>adage</FONT></B> is a time-honoured and widely known proverb, such as "Actions speak louder than words."</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>maxim</FONT></B> is a practical rule of conduct or action, such as, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be." The <B><FONT color=blue>motto</FONT></B> differs from the maxim in that it merely states a guiding principle or belief rather than a precept. <I><FONT color=brown>Mottoes</FONT></I> are usually chosen by a group, an institution, a nation, etc., as an expression of a purpose or ideal. ["Be prepared" is the <I><FONT color=brown>motto</FONT></I> of the Boy Scouts; "In God we trust" is the <I><FONT color=brown>motto</FONT></I> of the United States.]</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>saying</FONT></B> is a figure of speech or a remark of any type that is current among ordinary people. <I><FONT color=brown>Sayings</FONT></I> are repeated often, sometimes to the point of losing their freshness. [As the <I><FONT color=brown>saying</FONT></I> goes, "He has bats in the belfry", As I always say, "Live and let live."] <I><FONT color=brown>Saying</FONT></I> also has the general meaning of any noteworthy or pungent observation, especially one of a group culled from the writings and speeches of well-known figures. One speaks of the <I><FONT color=brown>saying</FONT></I> of Marcus Aurelius or the <I><FONT color=brown>sayings</FONT></I> of Confucius.</P><P>The remaining words all refer to expressions that are more consciously literary or clever than are <I><FONT color=brown>proverbs</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>adages</FONT></I>; furthermore, their authorship is more often known. An <B><FONT color=blue>epigram</FONT></B> is a brief, pointed remark in verse, prose or conversation that expresses a witty or even satirical observation. "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it," wrote Oscar Wilde, a composer of brilliant <I><FONT color=brown>epigrams</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Epigraphs</FONT></B> is sometimes confused with <I><FONT color=brown>epigram</FONT></I>, but it refers strictly to a brief quotations, rich in implications, that introduces a piece of writing: Eliot used a quotation from Conrad as an <I><FONT color=brown>epigraph</FONT></I> to his poem "The Hollow Men." Less commonly now, the word can refer also to the inscription of a <I><FONT color=brown>motto</FONT></I> in some material such as store or metal: the <I><FONT color=brown>epigraph</FONT></I> on the coin. <B><FONT color=blue>Epitaph</FONT></B>, often confused with <I><FONT color=brown>epigram</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>epigraph</FONT></I>, refers to a verse or prose inscription on a tombstone, or, more generally, to any phrase by which someone is remembered after death. Whether signed or anonymous, an <I><FONT color=brown>epitaph</FONT></I> may be composed for the occasion or consist of a quoted adage or motto: a hobby of collecting colourful epitaphs to be found in old graveyards.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>aphorism</FONT></B> is a thought-provoking remark that does not yield all its meaning so readily as an <I><FONT color=brown>epigram</FONT></I> and aims at profundity rather than wit. An <I><FONT color=brown>aphorism</FONT></I> may be embedded in a longer work, as the following observation from King Lear: "As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport." In other cases, authors have deliberately written groups, sequences or even books of <I><FONT color=brown>aphorisms</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>aphorisms</FONT></I> of Kafka. An <B><FONT color=blue>apothegm</FONT></B> is a startling or paradoxical assertion, such as Swift’s remark. "There is nothing in this world constant but inconstancy."</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Truism">TRUISM</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to an act, decision or situation that is subject or subordinate to factors either in evidence or thought likely to come about. <B><FONT color=blue>Provisional</FONT></B> may refer merely to something adopted for the moment out of temporary necessity or until something adopted better can be arranged: a <I><FONT color=brown>provisional</FONT></I> plan. More pertinent here, the word often suggests a situation that is allowed to exist provided certain results are forthcoming: given <I><FONT color=brown>provisional</FONT></I> status as a matriculated student until his examination results were available. The word usually suggests that the crucial factors determining ultimate status are those that lie in the future. Something even less certain than <I><FONT color=brown>provisional</FONT></I> is <B><FONT color=blue>tentative</FONT></B>, which means experimental in nature. <I><FONT color=brown>Provisional</FONT></I> actions, methods, etc., would have greater chances of adoption or success than those that are <I><FONT color=brown>tentative</FONT></I>: He made a few <I><FONT color=brown>tentative</FONT></I> moves to find a solution to the problem before giving in altogether.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dependent</FONT></B>, by contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>provisional</FONT></I>, may indicate something subject to factors past, present or future: rapid growth that was <I><FONT color=brown>dependent</FONT></I> upon the groundwork laid in the last century; a sense of well-being that is <I><FONT color=brown>dependent</FONT></I> mainly on overall physical health. The word also often suggests factors that may be imposed or stipulated as part of an agreement or contract: an increased allowance that was to be <I><FONT color=brown>dependent</FONT></I> upon the uses to which it was put.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conditional</FONT></B> stresses almost exclusively this last sense of dependent, suggesting an agreement that will be honoured by one side if its terms are held to by the other: <I><FONT color=brown>conditional</FONT></I> approval of the book, provided certain passages were deleted. The word, less specifically, may simply mean <I><FONT color=brown>tentative</FONT></I>: could give only <I><FONT color=brown>conditional</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>tentative</FONT></I>) praise to the report, not having studied the transcript in detail. <B><FONT color=blue>Contingent</FONT></B> may refer at its least complex to something liable to happen: fearing that defeat was <I><FONT color=brown>contingent</FONT></I>. It may also indicate something unforeseen or occurring by chance or accident: <I><FONT color=brown>contingent</FONT></I> catastrophes. A more pertinent and wider use is to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship of any sort: a political victory wholly <I><FONT color=brown>contingent</FONT></I> upon the personal popularity of the winner. The word may also suggest something <I><FONT color=brown>dependent</FONT></I> upon an uncertain event or condition. [Historical processes are <I><FONT color=brown>contingent</FONT></I> upon so many imponderables as to make untenable the approach of the scientific determinist.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Flimsy">FLIMSY</A>, <A href="entry://Assistant">SUBORDINATE</A>, <A href="entry://Temporary">TEMPORARY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conclusive">CONCLUSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Definite">DEFINITE</A>, independent, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to serious disturbances of the mind. <B><FONT color=blue>Psychotic</FONT></B> is the most precise of these, being used by psychiatrists to describe someone who exhibits a break with or withdrawal from reality; the word contrasts with neurotic, which describes someone with a distorted view of reality. A <I><FONT color=brown>psychotic</FONT></I> personality may be anti-social, violent or merely passive: <I><FONT color=brown>psychotic</FONT></I> delusions; <I><FONT color=brown>psychotic</FONT></I> acts of cruelty; <I><FONT color=brown>psychotic</FONT></I> apathy. The word may also be used by sociologists to describe, less precisely, acts that are extreme departures from social norms: a <I><FONT color=brown>psychotic</FONT></I> split between duty and simply humanity that resulted in the setting-up of the concentration camps. The word has also entered the popular consciousness, where it can be used imprecisely as a simply term of opprobrium: my <I><FONT color=brown>psychotic</FONT></I> mother-in-law.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Psychopathic</FONT></B> is even more likely to be used in a popular context, although here it is more often a precise high-toned substitute for vicious or brutal: a <I><FONT color=brown>psychopathic</FONT></I> killer. In its strict psychiatric use, however, it refers to someone who exhibits no break with reality, unlike the <I><FONT color=brown>psychotic</FONT></I>, but who has no sense of social responsibility; while this may result in violent or criminal acts, it may also result in extreme withdrawal or passivity.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Demented</FONT></B> at its most precise indicates someone whose mentality has degenerated from a previous level that was more nearly normal: brain damage that left him <I><FONT color=brown>demented</FONT></I>. More often the word is used loosely to refer to anyone who seems possessed by odd obsessions or eccentricities: her <I><FONT color=brown>demented</FONT></I> fear of strangers. <B><FONT color=blue>Insane</FONT></B>, a word now abandoned by most psychologists and psychiatrists, it still used legally to refer to someone who is so mentally disturbed as to be unable to distinguish morally between right and wrong. In popular usage, it may refer also to things that appear foolish or ridiculous: a trial that hinged on whether or not the accused could be considered <I><FONT color=brown>insane</FONT></I> at the time of the murder; an <I><FONT color=brown>insane</FONT></I> scheme for making a million on the stock exchange. The word can even be used as a superlative for anything intense, exciting or fun: an absolutely <I><FONT color=brown>insane</FONT></I> beach party. <B><FONT color=blue>Deranged</FONT></B> is less likely to be used in either a psychological or legal context, but, in a general way, it has validity in formal usage to refer to mental or emotional drives or balances that have become disordered: <I><FONT color=brown>deranged</FONT></I> by fever; <I><FONT color=brown>deranged</FONT></I> from a lack of food and water; She suffered a sudden shock that <I><FONT color=brown>deranged</FONT></I> her completely.</P><P>The remaining words no longer have valid uses in either psychological or legal discussion. <B><FONT color=blue>Lunatic</FONT></B>, in fact, is now less often used on any level of speech because of its old-fashioned sound and its overtones of ignorance and superstition; its root refers to a belief that the moon could cause mental disturbance. Sometimes it is still used comically or disapprovingly for odd or undesirable behaviour: a <I><FONT color=brown>lunatic</FONT></I> notion that anyone should be able to own lethal weapons. It is also commonly found in the expression "<I><FONT color=brown>lunatic</FONT></I> fringe," which denotes those followers or devotees of a movement, idea, etc., who are extreme or fanatical in their enthusiasm. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>mad</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>crazy</FONT></B> are used widely to refer popularly to mental disturbance. <I><FONT color=brown>Mad</FONT></I>, the more formal of the two, may suggest profound mental disorder. More informally, the word can also refer to anything silly, flamboyant pointless, unrealistic or irrational: a <I><FONT color=brown>mad</FONT></I> feathered hat; a <I><FONT color=brown>mad</FONT></I> hope that help might still come; a <I><FONT color=brown>mad</FONT></I> desire to wreak vengeance on his imagined oppressor. Careful writers avoid the word when it means angry: remarks that made her <I><FONT color=brown>mad</FONT></I> at me. <I><FONT color=brown>Crazy</FONT></I> is the most informal of these and refers popularly to someone who is extremely neurotic or psychotic. The word also has a wide range of additional uses to refer to the eccentric, odd, troubled or desiring: a <I><FONT color=brown>crazy</FONT></I> collection of furniture; a <I><FONT color=brown>crazy</FONT></I> dread of failing in the exam; <I><FONT color=brown>crazy</FONT></I> about sailors. It can even express approval for something that goes to extremes: a <I><FONT color=brown>crazy</FONT></I> New Year’s Eve party.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Frantic">FRANTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Frenzy">FRENZY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Sensible">SENSIBLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the action of moving something towards one or in the same direction in which one is moving. <B><FONT color=blue>Pull</FONT></B> is the most general word in the group, embracing all the other terms within its meaning: pull<I><FONT color=brown>i</FONT></I>ng the cart behind him; <I><FONT color=brown>pulling</FONT></I> a straw from the broom; <I><FONT color=brown>pulling</FONT></I> the fallen climber out of the crevasse. While <I><FONT color=brown>pull</FONT></I> can suggest movement in any direction, <B><FONT color=blue>drag</FONT></B> usually refers to horizontal motion or motion up an incline; it suggests laborious effort over rough ground or against friction, resistance or gravity: <I><FONT color=brown>dragging</FONT></I> his feet across the floor; <I><FONT color=brown>dragging</FONT></I> the body out of the crashed aircraft; <I><FONT color=brown>dragging</FONT></I> each stone for the pyramid up the long hill. <B><FONT color=blue>Draw</FONT></B> has the same root as <I><FONT color=brown>drag</FONT></I>, and almost the same sense, except that it may also involve some form of traction, as with a small vehicle or cart: She <I><FONT color=brown>drew</FONT></I> him tenderly towards her; The boy <I><FONT color=brown>drew</FONT></I> the load of newspapers around the streets in his billy cart.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Haul</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>drag</FONT></I> in suggesting laborious effort and rough going, but it is like <I><FONT color=brown>pull</FONT></I> in suggesting movement in any direction: <I><FONT color=brown>hauling</FONT></I> the loaded basket up two stories by a long, sturdy rope; <I><FONT color=brown>hauling</FONT></I> the raft over the sandbar. <B><FONT color=blue>Tug</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>yank</FONT></B> both refer to intermittent or quick pulls on something: <I><FONT color=brown>tugging</FONT></I> at my sleeve to ask directions; <I><FONT color=brown>tugging</FONT></I> at his chains. <I><FONT color=brown>Yank</FONT></I> is much more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>tug</FONT></I> and might be considered slang by some. The word suggests abruptness and, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>tug</FONT></I>, is more often used of a single motion than a series of small, quick motions: <I><FONT color=brown>yanking</FONT></I> me bodily from my chair; <I><FONT color=brown>yanking</FONT></I> the picture from the wall.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Carry">CARRY</A>, <A href="entry://Impel">IMPEL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Propel">PROPEL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the result towards which one chooses to direct one’s activity. <B><FONT color=blue>Purpose</FONT></B> may suggest either a resolute, deliberate movement towards a result or the desired result itself: filled with high <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I>; explaining the <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I> of the tedious exercise. The specific overtone of <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I> in either use is that of meaningfulness: unable to comprehend a universe without <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I>; a cruel act done on <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I>. The other words in this group do not carry this implication and concentrate mostly on the desired result, rather than on the manner of moving towards it. Of these, <B><FONT color=blue>goal</FONT></B> is closest to purpose in suggesting a deliberately selected result that can be won only with difficulty by dedicated on choice is more invariable here than with <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I>; the latter might be supplied by someone else, but a <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I> suggests a personal determination: a tutorial system whose <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I> was to let each student realize his own educational <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I>. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I> is used in a vaguer way to mean the general trend or direction a person or group takes, without implying any final result: the <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I> of a free democracy; asking himself what his <I><FONT color=brown>goals</FONT></I> in life should be.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Aim</FONT></B> is often used in this vague way, suggesting a general tendency: the <I><FONT color=brown>aims</FONT></I> of education; his <I><FONT color=brown>aim</FONT></I> in life. In the singular, it implies a more concrete choice than <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I>, one that could be spelt out succinctly. When used of a desired result, <I><FONT color=brown>aim</FONT></I> is most appropriate for a small or short-term <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I> and is consequently less dramatic in tone than <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I>: going to Venice with the <I><FONT color=brown>aim</FONT></I> of seeing as many Tintorettos as possible. <I><FONT color=brown>Aim</FONT></I> also suggests less emotional involvement in the outcome than <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I>, and less determination that it will be achieved. <B><FONT color=blue>End</FONT></B> is more formal than the foregoing words and is most specifically appropriate to philosophical or ethical discussions: theorizing that the <I><FONT color=brown>end</FONT></I> of exogamy is species differentiation; the <I><FONT color=brown>ends</FONT></I> of a just society. Because it has other meanings that are more common, the word in this sense is often restricted to uses in which it contrasts with the manner of achieving a given <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I>: arguing that the <I><FONT color=brown>end</FONT></I> justifies the means.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Object</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>objective</FONT></B> would seem too close to distinguish between, but each ahs a context in which it is the more appropriate of the two. Both are more formal than the other words of this group and are often used for impersonal planning of an abstract or general nature: the elimination of TB as the <I><FONT color=brown>object</FONT></I> of the campaign; economic <I><FONT color=brown>objectives</FONT></I> of the second five-year plan. <I><FONT color=brown>Object</FONT></I> would be most appropriate for an <I><FONT color=brown>aim</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I> that could be stated in a few words; <I><FONT color=brown>objective</FONT></I> suggests a wider, more intangible set of <I><FONT color=brown>goals</FONT></I> that includes a good many imponderables. <I><FONT color=brown>Objective</FONT></I> however, has a military use for a specific or limited <I><FONT color=brown>goal</FONT></I>: naming Hill 104 as our <I><FONT color=brown>objective</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Object</FONT></I>, by contrast, nearly always suggests specificness or singleness of <I><FONT color=brown>purpose</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>object</FONT></I> of our search; the <I><FONT color=brown>object</FONT></I> of his fantasy life.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Intend">INTEND</A>, <A href="entry://Plan">PLAN</A>, <A href="entry://Project">PROJECT</A>.</P>

<P>These words apply to things that are hard to solve, answer or understand. In a limited sense, all are questions, tasks or entertainments that have set answers or solutions and are devised to challenge the wits. A <B><FONT color=blue>puzzle</FONT></B> is a game or contrivance that tests one’s ingenuity or patience. To work out a jigsaw <I><FONT color=brown>puzzle</FONT></I> or a crossword <I><FONT color=brown>puzzle</FONT></I>, one must fit together pieces or words in a certain way to form a whole. A <B><FONT color=blue>problem</FONT></B> is an exercise in learning that tests one’s ability to apply theory, knowledge and technique. To work a <I><FONT color=brown>problem</FONT></I> in mathematics, one must use the given facts to find the missing ones: The <I><FONT color=brown>problem</FONT></I> is to find the average speed of a car on a trip when the distance travelled and travelling time are known. A <B><FONT color=blue>mystery</FONT></B> in this comparison is a story, novel, play or film that arouses one’s curiosity or suspense: a murder <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I>. To solve a <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I>, one must follow clues and interpret evidence in order to find a plausible explanation for perplexing events. In actuality, a <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I> story is both plotted and solved by its author, who must keep the reader guessing until the end.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Enigma</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>riddle</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>conundrum</FONT></B> all apply to questions or statements designed to perplex. An <I><FONT color=brown>enigma</FONT></I> is a deliberately obscure or ambiguous statement, a dark saying meant to hid as much as it reveals: The Delphic oracle spoke in <I><FONT color=brown>enigmas</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>riddle</FONT></I> is a puzzling question stated as a problem to be solved by clever ingenuity. <I><FONT color=brown>Riddles</FONT></I> may be significant, requiring a grasp of metaphor or the ability to comprehend a paradox. The famous <I><FONT color=brown>riddle</FONT></I> of the Sphinx was an <I><FONT color=brown>enigma</FONT></I> that only Oedipus could interpret: "What goes on four legs in the morning, on two at noon, on three at night?" "Man ?in infancy he crawls, at his prime he walks, in age he leans on a staff." On the other hand, a <I><FONT color=brown>riddle</FONT></I> may be merely clever, depending on a pun, as: "What is black and white and red (read) all over?" "A newspaper." A <I><FONT color=brown>conundrum</FONT></I> is a riddle that hinges on a pun and involves some fanciful point of likeness or difference between things, as: "What is the difference between a supervisor in a department store and a sailor?" "One oversees sales and the other sails over seas." <I><FONT color=brown>Conundrum</FONT></I> is an adult word for a child’s game ?a kind of <I><FONT color=brown>riddle</FONT></I> at best ingenious, at worst inane.</P><P>In a broader sense, all these words may be applied to anything that baffles or perplexes. <I><FONT color=brown>Problem</FONT></I> is the most general word. Any person or thing that causes difficulty may be called a <I><FONT color=brown>problem</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I> was originally something beyond human understanding: the <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I> of creation; religious <I><FONT color=brown>mysteries</FONT></I>. But the word <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I> is now freely applied to <I><FONT color=brown>puzzling</FONT></I> things that have not been explained or that are not fully understood. [Her disappearance has remained a <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I>; Why he went there is a <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I> to me.] <I><FONT color=brown>Riddle</FONT></I> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I> in this sense but stresses the idea of eventual solution: the unsolved <I><FONT color=brown>riddle</FONT></I> of the common cold. An <I><FONT color=brown>enigma</FONT></I> is a tantalizing <I><FONT color=brown>mystery</FONT></I>, something darkly veiled or utterly baffling: his biographer passed over his hearty, wholesome public image to probe the <I><FONT color=brown>enigma</FONT></I> of his private life. Applied to human beings, <I><FONT color=brown>enigma</FONT></I> stresses internal contradictions, the presence of opposed traits that make a person hard to understand. <I><FONT color=brown>Puzzle</FONT></I> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>enigma</FONT></I> in this sense but is a less romantic and more pragmatic word, emphasizing the fitting together of pieces to find a solution: Though many tried to fathom him out and to predict what he would do, the leader remained a <I><FONT color=brown>puzzle</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Conundrum</FONT></I>, the most specific of these words, is the only one never applied to a person. When used in an extended sense, it means a problem that seems to defy solution but that invites conjecture.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Confuse">CONFUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Obscure">OBSCURE</A>.</P>

quantity
<B><FONT color=blue>quantity</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>amount</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>number</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the total size, sum or extent of something measurable. In general use, <B><FONT color=blue>quantity</FONT></B> suggests that something is considered in its totality, in terms of mass or bulk: a sufficient quantity of food to last a week. <I><FONT color=brown>Quantity</FONT></I>, itself, is that property of a thing that admits of exact measurement. In order to express a quantity in precise terms, it is necessary to divide it into units of some kind, measuring it in terms of magnitude, volume, size, sum, weight or length. A <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I> of water in a storage tank, for example, can be measured in terms of gallons. <B><FONT color=blue>Amount</FONT></B> is often very close to <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I> in meaning but may differ significantly in its use. It implies that the thing thought of in sum or in the aggregate can be broken down into separate units or parts that can be measured, counted, or otherwise specified: a large <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I> of gravel; a limited <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I> of time; a large <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I> of money; a considerable <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I> of work. <I><FONT color=brown>Amount</FONT></I> rather than quantity is the word generally used of immeasurable or intangible things: He went to a considerable <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I> of trouble. It is <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I>, however, and not <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I>, that is considered in terms of quality, indicating the contrast between bulk or output and the immaterial value of excellence.</P><P>When used collectively, <B><FONT color=blue>number</FONT></B> points to a collection of individual things that can be counted, referring to things that are physically or symbolically separate, not merely separable into units. Where <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I> emphasizes the whole, <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> focuses on the parts: an <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I> of money; a <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> of coins. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I> stresses measurement in bulk, <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> stresses individual items: a <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> of peaches; the <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I> of peaches in a bushel case. <I><FONT color=brown>Number</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I>, may be either specific or vague. It may refer to an indefinite or unspecified <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I>. [When he moved, a <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> of his books had to be left behind; A limited <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> of seats are still available.] Or it may refer to a specific sum or total count of units or individuals: The <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> of students absent is 6. When <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> is preceded by "the," it is used with a singular verb: The <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> of jobs is increasing. When preceded by "a," it is used with a plural verb: A <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> of graduates plan to apply. <I><FONT color=brown>Number</FONT></I>, when used with "a," and otherwise unqualified, can imply that the <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I> referred to is relatively large: A <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> of people signed the petition. Both <I><FONT color=brown>number</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>quantity</FONT></I>, when used in the plural, can indicate a large <I><FONT color=brown>amount</FONT></I> or group, or a sizeable collection. [<I><FONT color=brown>Quantities</FONT></I> of surplus materials are available; <I><FONT color=brown>Numbers</FONT></I> of people complained when the proposed shut-down was announced.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Part">PART</A>, <A href="entry://Total">TOTAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to behaviour, appearance or people considered out of the ordinary, strange or unusual. Something deemed <B><FONT color=blue>queer</FONT></B> is not only strange but often bizarre and inexplicable. [It was <I><FONT color=brown>queer</FONT></I> how the TV picture kept disappearing and reappearing even though the house lights didn’t flicker; a <I><FONT color=brown>queer</FONT></I> scraping sound, as though something were trying to get in the door.] <I><FONT color=brown>Queer</FONT></I> emphasizes both the singularity and strangeness of the event: a <I><FONT color=brown>queer</FONT></I> accident in which nobody was hurt but both cars were write-offs. (Compare "freak accident," which implies that the cause of the accident was a bizarre product of chance.) <I><FONT color=brown>Queer</FONT></I> is now often used in a slang sense in reference to homosexuals.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Odd</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>peculiar</FONT></B> are closely allied in popular use and are interchangeable in these contexts, but the basic meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>peculiar</FONT></I> is having a unique or special character; oddness or eccentricity is neither central nor necessary to its meaning. [Great minds generally look at life in a way <I><FONT color=brown>peculiar</FONT></I> to themselves; A <I><FONT color=brown>peculiarly</FONT></I> apt choice of words.] The more popular meaning of strange or odd has been derived from this sense: a <I><FONT color=brown>peculiar</FONT></I> habit of scratching his ear while he talked. But not that even here <I><FONT color=brown>peculiar</FONT></I> does not necessarily imply oddness; whether the habit is to be thought of as merely distinctive or as unusual to the point of being eccentric depends upon the larger context. <I><FONT color=brown>Odd</FONT></I> may be used for slight or extremely unusual qualities of behaviour or appearance; it stresses deviation from the normal, ordinary or expected: He was more than a little <I><FONT color=brown>odd</FONT></I>, very fastidious about his manners but an incredibly sloppy dresser.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Funny</FONT></B> may be an informal word for peculiar or remarkable. [That’s <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I>; I could have sworn I was wearing a hat when I came in here.] Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I> suggests an endearing or winning quality: a <I><FONT color=brown>funny</FONT></I> way of wrinkling her nose. <B><FONT color=blue>Crazy</FONT></B>, a word never used by psychiatrists except in jest, means mad or insane: He was acting in a <I><FONT color=brown>crazy</FONT></I> way, throwing up his hands and singing, then yelling that somebody was murdering him. Nowadays the word is probably more often used to mean acting as if mad, or simply unconventional, off-beat or hard to understand: a <I><FONT color=brown>crazy</FONT></I> driver, weaving in and out of traffic; Pushing a car is a <I><FONT color=brown>crazy</FONT></I> thing to do when you have a weak heart.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bizarre">BIZARRE</A>, <A href="entry://Eccentricity">ECCENTRICITY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P>

quell
<B><FONT color=blue>quell</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>calm</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>placate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>subdue</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>suppress</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>tranquillize</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are related in that they all mean to restore to a state of peace, quiet or order. <B><FONT color=blue>Quell</FONT></B>, suppress and subdue mean to put an end to a disturbance, such as a riot or a revolt, by the use of persuasion or force. To <I><FONT color=brown>quell</FONT></I> an uprising, one may employ either persuasion or force, or both; and the word suggests taking measures to discourage the participants in order to keep the situation from getting out of hand: The sergeants were able to <I><FONT color=brown>quell</FONT></I> the mêlée that broke out in the barracks by ordering all the men to stand to attention. Used figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>quell</FONT></I> may mean merely to allay or quiet, as in the case of certain feelings: to <I><FONT color=brown>quell</FONT></I> foolish fears; the mother’s happiness in the event often <I><FONT color=brown>quelling</FONT></I> the pains attending childbirth. <B><FONT color=blue>Suppress</FONT></B> in this sense means to <I><FONT color=brown>quell</FONT></I> by taking specific actions that will not only put down a disturbance completely but will frustrate any attempts to revive it or to start a similar one. The word suggests a complete crushing and overpowering, often swift and violent in nature: to <I><FONT color=brown>suppress</FONT></I> a mutiny by putting half the crew in irons and hanging the ringleaders at dawn. <B><FONT color=blue>Subdue</FONT></B> takes the participants in a disturbance as its object and implies that they are not only reduced to order but, by the imposition of controls (such as curfews or threats of reprisal), are also rendered more or less incapable of resisting further. In addition to the implication of conquering completely, <I><FONT color=brown>subdue</FONT></I> also carries the idea of taming or rendering mild and gentle, often after greater difficulty: The great, thundering stallion was finally <I><FONT color=brown>subdued</FONT></I> and broken in as a riding horse.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Calm</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>placate</FONT></B> are milder in meaning than the foregoing words and apply only to the quietening of violent movement or emotion. <I><FONT color=brown>Calm</FONT></I> is the more general term here and implies causing a state of quietude ?which may be only transient. [The nurses <I><FONT color=brown>calmed</FONT></I> the anxious patient with soothing words and small attentions; While awaiting trial, the angry prisoner <I><FONT color=brown>calmed</FONT></I> down enough to co-operate with his lawyer in preparing his defence.] <I><FONT color=brown>Placate</FONT></I> always involves appeasement and means to <I><FONT color=brown>calm</FONT></I> anger, resentment, hostility, etc., by making concessions or yielding to demands: Only by offering to do extra work at the end of the term could be <I><FONT color=brown>placate</FONT></I> the teacher who seemed determined to fail him.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tranquillize</FONT></B>, still a fad word after some years of use, is a back-formation from the medical term <I><FONT color=brown>tranquillizer</FONT></I>, which is applied to a class of drugs having the property of reducing nervous tension and states of anxiety. It is rarely used in the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>calm</FONT></I> or pacify and almost always refers to the effect produced by these drugs.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Discourage">DISCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Docile">DOCILE</A>, subjugate, <A href="entry://Vanquish">VANQUISH</A>.</P>

question
<B><FONT color=blue>question</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>grill</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>interrogate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>quiz</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the asking or demanding of information. Of these, <B><FONT color=blue>question</FONT></B> is the most general in meaning and the most neutral in tone. At its most restricted, it may be used as a more formal substitute for ask, in the sense of making a single or specific query: <I><FONT color=brown>questioning</FONT></I> the woman at the information desk about where he could exchange certain goods. More pertinent here, is its use to suggest the asking of a series of <I><FONT color=brown>questions</FONT></I> to bring information to light: <I><FONT color=brown>questioning</FONT></I> the witnesses for details about the physical appearance of the murderer. It may suggest an informal situation: <I><FONT color=brown>questioning</FONT></I> him about why he was so late getting home from work. Often, the word points to an official or formal situation: The suspect was brought to the police station to be <I><FONT color=brown>questioned</FONT></I> about his connections with the deceased man. <B><FONT color=blue>Interrogate</FONT></B> is a much more formal substitute for question and is mostly restricted to an official examination of some sort: warning him that the police prosecutor would <I><FONT color=brown>interrogate</FONT></I> him about matters that might embarrass him.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Grill</FONT></B>, by contrast, is a much more informal word commonly used in the United States; it applies specifically to intensive interrogating in which someone is subjected to pressure to reveal information: a dozen petty criminals who had been rounded up and <I><FONT color=brown>grilled</FONT></I> for hours about their activities on the night of the hold-up. The pressure may be psychological, but can extend to physical torture: <I><FONT color=brown>grilling</FONT></I> the captured guerrilla by the water-torture method. <B><FONT color=blue>Quiz</FONT></B> suggests the use of much less strenuous means than grill and may apply to more ordinary situations; it does suggest intensive <I><FONT color=brown>questioning</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>quizzing</FONT></I> her children about every move they had made while she was gone. Often the word suggests an educational context, referring in this case to short informal tests, oral or written, conducted to determine the mastery of assigned work: <I><FONT color=brown>quizzing</FONT></I> the students twice a week on their outside reading.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Demand">DEMAND</A>, <A href="entry://Examine">EXAMINE</A>, <A href="entry://Inquiry">INQUIRY</A>, <A href="entry://Question">QUESTION</A> (n.), <A href="entry://Request">REQUEST</A> (v.).</P>

<P>These words refer to speed of movement. While <B><FONT color=blue>quick</FONT></B> can apply widely, it often refers less to rate of motion than to the suddenness or brief duration of a single action: a <I><FONT color=brown>quick</FONT></I> leap; a <I><FONT color=brown>quick</FONT></I> response to my question; The hand is <I><FONT color=brown>quicker</FONT></I> than the eye. It can apply also to a readiness to act: <I><FONT color=brown>quick</FONT></I> to take offence. When it indicates something of short duration, it often implies haste: He ate a <I><FONT color=brown>quick</FONT></I> breakfast and rushed off to work. While <B><FONT color=blue>fast</FONT></B>, too, can apply in a wide variety of ways, it is more apt than <I><FONT color=brown>quick</FONT></I> for referring to something in sustained motion, indicating here a high rate of speed or a capacity for such movement: a <I><FONT color=brown>fast</FONT></I> car; a <I><FONT color=brown>fast</FONT></I> getaway; You're reading too <I><FONT color=brown>fast</FONT></I> for me to follow.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rapid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>swift</FONT></B> are both more formal than the preceding pair and apply equally well to sudden or sustained movement: a <I><FONT color=brown>rapid</FONT></I> river; a <I><FONT color=brown>rapid</FONT></I> burst of machine-gun fire; a <I><FONT color=brown>swift</FONT></I> change of mood; a <I><FONT color=brown>swift</FONT></I> runner. <I><FONT color=brown>Rapid</FONT></I> has a special connotation relating to beneficial or advantageous speed; by contrast, both <I><FONT color=brown>quick</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fast</FONT></I> can apply as well to catastrophic haste: a <I><FONT color=brown>rapid</FONT></I> recovery from his illness; <I><FONT color=brown>rapid</FONT></I> progress in slum clearance. A special connotation of swift relates to speed that is smooth, undisturbing, uninterrupted or seemingly effortless: a <I><FONT color=brown>swift</FONT></I> transition without hesitation or awkwardness; a communications network that was <I><FONT color=brown>swift</FONT></I> and silent in operation. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>swift</FONT></I> can give a lyrical overtone: the <I><FONT color=brown>swift</FONT></I> fading of autumn into winter.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Precipitate</FONT></B> is the one word here that stresses dangerous, undesirable or foolhardy speed: two cars in a <I><FONT color=brown>precipitate</FONT></I> race through suburban traffic; a disguise that served him well in his <I><FONT color=brown>precipitate</FONT></I> flight from the concentration camp. <B><FONT color=blue>Precipitous</FONT></B> can often suggest falling or abrupt downward movement: the <I><FONT color=brown>precipitous</FONT></I> fall of share prices. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>precipitous</FONT></I> is erroneously used for precipitate. <I><FONT color=brown>Precipitous</FONT></I> means "very steep" and <I><FONT color=brown>precipitate</FONT></I> "violently hurried."

<P>These words mean to move or cause to move faster. <B><FONT color=blue>Quicken</FONT></B> suggests greater animation in the performance of an action, as well as a shorter time required for its completion; it is close in sense to <B><FONT color=blue>accelerate</FONT></B>, which denotes an increase in the rate of movement, growth, progress, etc., of a thing. [The dancers <I><FONT color=brown>quickened</FONT></I> their steps; Neglect has <I><FONT color=brown>accelerated</FONT></I> this building’s decay.] <B><FONT color=blue>Speed</FONT></B> differs from <I><FONT color=brown>quicken</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>accelerate</FONT></I> in that it always implies rapidity of movement: The car sped along the road; to speed production by providing better working conditions. <B><FONT color=blue>Hasten</FONT></B> indicates urgency or sometimes a sudden and premature result. [The storm’s approach <I><FONT color=brown>hastened</FONT></I> our departure; as the time for the guest’s arrival approached, the housewife <I><FONT color=brown>hastened</FONT></I> her dinner preparations.] <B><FONT color=blue>Hurry</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rush</FONT></B> are similar to <I><FONT color=brown>hasten</FONT></I>, but suggest in addition precipitate or confused motion. [The late arrivals were <I><FONT color=brown>hurried</FONT></I> to their seats; The stricken man was <I><FONT color=brown>rushed</FONT></I> to a hospital.] <I><FONT color=brown>Rush</FONT></I> suggests greater urgency than <I><FONT color=brown>hurry</FONT></I>, and sometimes includes the notion of violent action: The suddenly <I><FONT color=brown>rushed</FONT></I> pell-mell out of the door. <B><FONT color=blue>Expedite</FONT></B>, more especially a business term than any of the other words of this group, means to process quickly, or give special attention to, in order to save time: The delivery of your new car will be <I><FONT color=brown>expedited</FONT></I> by a "<I><FONT color=brown>rush</FONT></I>" order. <I><FONT color=brown>Expedite</FONT></I> thus has a distant and formal tone that distinguishes it from emotionally charged words like <I><FONT color=brown>rush</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>hurry</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impetuous">IMPETUOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Speed">SPEED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Delay">DELAY</A>, <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, <A href="entry://Stop">STOP</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to short supporting passages from a longer work or another person or to brief evaluations cited in praise or blame. <B><FONT color=blue>Quotation</FONT></B> specifically refers to a passage from another source, clearly indicated as such; it suggests an exact word-for-word rendering of what the other person said: failing to make clear in his text what was summary and what <I><FONT color=brown>quotation</FONT></I> of his opponent’s argument. Brevity is usually but not necessarily an implication of this word: justifying his viewpoint by extensive <I><FONT color=brown>quotations</FONT></I> from his source material. <I><FONT color=brown>Quotation</FONT></I> can apply to only a few words; <B><FONT color=blue>extract</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>excerpt</FONT></B>, in contrast, suggest longer passage from another source. <I><FONT color=brown>Extract</FONT></I> usually refers to several lines of a paragraph, especially when these are set off from the text in which they are cited by the use of indentation or smaller type: concluding his review with a twenty-line <I><FONT color=brown>extract</FONT></I> from the title poem. <I><FONT color=brown>Excerpt</FONT></I> can mean much the same, but is used also to suggest a longer passage still and may be presented in and for itself, without comment: Several magazines published <I><FONT color=brown>excerpts</FONT></I> from his novel.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Blurb</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>quote</FONT></B> are much more informal terms than the other words here considered. <I><FONT color=brown>Blurb</FONT></I> refers to commendatory words that are cited on the dust-jacket of a book or in advertisements for a play or film. A <I><FONT color=brown>blurb</FONT></I> may consist of or include <I><FONT color=brown>quotations</FONT></I> from critics or be an entirely anonymous account designed to persuade a customer to read or see the work. The word is often used pejoratively to refer to the extravagant and insincere praise common in such writing: a <I><FONT color=brown>blurb</FONT></I> comparing the author to Homer and Shakespeare. <B><FONT color=blue>Quote</FONT></B> is a slangy-sounding shortened form of <I><FONT color=brown>quotation</FONT></I>, used in much the same way as the more formal word. Its natural context is the field of journalism, where it suggests a brief comment by someone who has permitted its publication, either with or without attribution: Reporters were telephoning every firefighting official for a <I><FONT color=brown>quote</FONT></I> on the bushfire crisis.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Copy">COPY</A>, <A href="entry://Duplicate">DUPLICATE</A>.</P>

raid
<B><FONT color=blue>raid</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>foray</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>incursion</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>invasion</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sortie</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a physical and hostile entering of someone else’s territory. <B><FONT color=blue>Raid</FONT></B> suggests an organized but short-range and temporary encroachment: boys planning a <I><FONT color=brown>raid</FONT></I> on the neighbour’s orchard; an unexpected <I><FONT color=brown>raid</FONT></I> on the jungle stronghold of the enemy. As in these examples, stealth and surprise may be suggested as planned elements of a <I><FONT color=brown>raid</FONT></I>. The word can be used humorously for less hostile acts: laying in a supply of meat and salad for the inevitable midnight <I><FONT color=brown>raid</FONT></I> on the refrigerator. <B><FONT color=blue>Foray</FONT></B> suggests a more scattered, less organized overrunning of territory than raid; it may be haphazard and impulsive as well and even more short-ranged and short-lived. A <I><FONT color=brown>foray’s</FONT></I> sole motivation may be an intent to wreak gratuitous havoc or to plunder and pillage: students who went on <I><FONT color=brown>forays</FONT></I> in the town; a <I><FONT color=brown>foray</FONT></I> behind enemy lines. A <B><FONT color=blue>sorties</FONT></B> is a special kind of raid. Originally meaning a dashing outbreak by a besieged garrison, it has come to refer almost exclusively to an operation by an aircraft in wartime: He flew three <I><FONT color=brown>sorties</FONT></I> in one day over France.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Incursion</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words and is often used in a technical sense to indicate a violation of a nation’s territory by another nation: arguing that the flight could be considered an <I><FONT color=brown>incursion</FONT></I> on Soviet airspace. In this sense it may suggest any encroachment: an <I><FONT color=brown>incursion</FONT></I> on civic rights. The word can also be used technically for any hostile entrance, usually sudden, into another’s territory: an armed <I><FONT color=brown>incursion</FONT></I> into the Gaza strip. <B><FONT color=blue>Invasion</FONT></B> resembles raid in suggesting an organized and well-planned violation of territory, but it specifically suggests a much more complicated and long-range operation that is usually carried out with the intention of effecting a seizure or change of a permanent sort: the massive Allied <I><FONT color=brown>invasion</FONT></I> of Normandy. Occasionally the word suggests a large-scale but unplanned <I><FONT color=brown>incursion</FONT></I>: the Danish invasion of Britain that occurred over several centuries and took the form of sporadic but repeated raids of forays. The word can also suggest any unwanted <I><FONT color=brown>intrusion</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>invasion</FONT></I> of privacy.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aggression">AGGRESSION</A>, <A href="entry://Attack">ATTACK</A>, <A href="entry://Encroach">ENCROACH</A>, <A href="entry://Fight">FIGHT</A>.</P>

<P>These words all mean to place in a higher position. <B><FONT color=blue>Raise</FONT></B> commonly implies a physical gesture or activity, although it is often applied in figurative senses to any improved condition or motive: to <I><FONT color=brown>raise</FONT></I> one’s hand; to <I><FONT color=brown>raise</FONT></I> one’s spirits with encouragement and kind words. <B><FONT color=blue>Elevate</FONT></B>, when applied to a literal rise in position or altitude, sounds very formal, even pretentious, <I><FONT color=brown>raise</FONT></I> being preferred in most such contexts. When applied figuratively to a rise in rank or distinction, <I><FONT color=brown>elevate</FONT></I> is commonly and easily used on a variety of levels: to <I><FONT color=brown>elevate</FONT></I> one’s goals; He was <I><FONT color=brown>elevated</FONT></I> from the rank of lieutenant to captain. In this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>raising</FONT></I> in rank or position, <B><FONT color=blue>promote</FONT></B> is most often used: <I><FONT color=brown>promoted</FONT></I> from lecturer to senior lecturer. In its extended uses, <I><FONT color=brown>promoted</FONT></I> has still a sense of raising in prestige or importance, although basically it suggests a carrying out of some function: <I><FONT color=brown>promoting</FONT></I> his friend’s case.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lift</FONT></B> suggests the use of physical effort in moving something to a higher position, and <B><FONT color=blue>hoist</FONT></B> often signifies <I><FONT color=brown>lifting</FONT></I> by mechanical means. When <I><FONT color=brown>hoist</FONT></I> is used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>lift</FONT></I>, it signifies a greater expenditure of effort, as that comparable to what would be required in <I><FONT color=brown>lifting</FONT></I> something by mechanical means: to <I><FONT color=brown>lift</FONT></I> a book off the table; to <I><FONT color=brown>hoist</FONT></I> the tractor aboard the ship; The fireman <I><FONT color=brown>hoisted</FONT></I> the heavy man to his shoulder before gingerly descending the ladder. <B><FONT color=blue>Uplift</FONT></B> may be used to mean to <I><FONT color=brown>raise</FONT></I> aloft, but is more commonly used today to mean to <I><FONT color=brown>elevate</FONT></I> morally or mentally: <I><FONT color=brown>uplifted</FONT></I> by our audience with the Pope.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Escalate">ESCALATE</A>, <A href="entry://Improve">IMPROVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: depress, <A href="entry://Descend">DESCEND</A>, lower.</P>

<P>These words refer to an aimless, irregular or erratic procedure. <B><FONT color=blue>Random</FONT></B> suggests something arrived at through accident or through arbitrary choices; it implies lack of specific direction or intent: a <I><FONT color=brown>random</FONT></I> gathering of friends and acquaintances; The followed a seemingly <I><FONT color=brown>random</FONT></I> track through the bush; having <I><FONT color=brown>random</FONT></I> thoughts on ways to redecorate her flat.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Casual</FONT></B> points to something that happens without intention or plan and may give a sense of freedom and ease: a <I><FONT color=brown>casual</FONT></I> meeting on the street; a <I><FONT color=brown>casual</FONT></I> question; a <I><FONT color=brown>casual</FONT></I> stroll on the lawn. On the other hand, it may also suggest the qualities of indifference or unconcern: a <I><FONT color=brown>casual</FONT></I> handshake; showing by his <I><FONT color=brown>casual</FONT></I> manner that he was unaffected by their plight.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Desultory</FONT></B> stresses a procedure marked by stops and starts but includes the lack of plan implied by random and the lack of formality implied by <I><FONT color=brown>casual</FONT></I>: the desul<I><FONT color=brown>t</FONT></I>ory talk of old friends interrupted by lapses and long silences. Less favoruably, the word can suggest wandering attention, instability or inconsistency: his <I><FONT color=brown>desultory</FONT></I> attempts to keep his correspondence up to date. <B><FONT color=blue>Haphazard</FONT></B> is even stronger in negative implications than <I><FONT color=brown>desultory</FONT></I>; it is used almost exclusively in a disapproving way for unsystematic work or behaviour that is indifferent to accuracy and efficiency: <I><FONT color=brown>haphazard</FONT></I> and slapdash experiments on which no sound conclusion can be based.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chance">CHANCE</A>, <A href="entry://Cursory">CURSORY</A>, <A href="entry://Occasional">OCCASIONAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Formal">FORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Invariable">INVARIABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Orderly">ORDERLY</A>, <A href="entry://Systematic">SYSTEMATIC</A>.</P>

<P>These words suggest the accomplishment of whatever training or conditioning is necessary as a preface to action. <B><FONT color=blue>Ready</FONT></B> is the most general of these, suggesting anything from a momentary potential for a certain kind of behaviour to a long period of discipline prior to an undertaking: <I><FONT color=brown>ready</FONT></I> to tell her exactly what he thought of her; <I><FONT color=brown>ready</FONT></I> to perform his first heart operation. In the first kind of use, the word suggests a ripeness for action that may have been building up for some time; in the second it suggests a delicate process of attunement. <I><FONT color=brown>Ready</FONT></I> may also suggest something that is easily available: a <I><FONT color=brown>ready</FONT></I> answer to the complex question. <B><FONT color=blue>Prepared</FONT></B> stresses that aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>ready</FONT></I> that suggests the active, conscious deliberation and effort preceding action: a student thoroughly <I><FONT color=brown>prepared</FONT></I> for the grueling examination. A more general use of <I><FONT color=brown>prepared</FONT></I> stresses a psychic resilience by which one can face alternatives not necessarily known in advance: conscientious parents whose children are <I><FONT color=brown>prepared</FONT></I> for the disappointments as well as the joys of life; <I><FONT color=brown>prepared</FONT></I> for any eventuality. <B><FONT color=blue>Set</FONT></B> suggests plans that have become definite or preparations that are complete and final: all <I><FONT color=brown>set</FONT></I> for the big party: <I><FONT color=brown>ready</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>set</FONT></I>, go.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disposed</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>willing</FONT></B> emphasize a different aspect of the period just before action, stressing desire rather than training or even conditioning: He was <I><FONT color=brown>willing</FONT></I> to take on the immense job, though he was poorly <I><FONT color=brown>prepared</FONT></I> for it. While <I><FONT color=brown>willing</FONT></I> implies an agreeable or voluntary choice, <I><FONT color=brown>disposed</FONT></I> suggests an innate proclivity or a settled and favourable attitude towards the impending action; <I><FONT color=brown>disposed</FONT></I> as he was to telling the truth, he was hardly <I><FONT color=brown>ready</FONT></I> to confront her with all that he knew. In a use closer to <I><FONT color=brown>ready</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>prepared</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>disposed</FONT></I> suggests a last positioning previous to action: two battalions <I><FONT color=brown>disposed</FONT></I> for an attack on the air base.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Observant">OBSERVANT</A>, <A href="entry://Organize">ORGANIZE</A>, <A href="entry://Plan">PLAN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: disorganized, inexperienced, unprepared, <A href="entry://Unwilling">UNWILLING</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the act of exact, objective thinking that deals with provable fact and abides by the rules of logic in tracing premises to conclusions. <B><FONT color=blue>Reasoning</FONT></B> is the most inclusive and informal of the words here, indicating any attempt to draw conclusions by the use of valid methods of thought while remaining impartial and admitting for consideration only unbiased data. <B><FONT color=blue>Ratiocination</FONT></B> is a more formal word for the same concept, but it may occasionally suggest a mind moving from one conclusion to another in a long, complex, even tortuous, process: a cogent and convincing piece of <I><FONT color=brown>reasoning</FONT></I> demonstrating the common origin of man; a process of <I><FONT color=brown>ratiocination</FONT></I> that led him to several unpleasant conclusions.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>inference</FONT></B> is, much more specifically, the movement from premises to conclusion; consequently <I><FONT color=brown>reasoning</FONT></I> may be side to be the attempt to make valid inferences, and <I><FONT color=brown>ratiocination</FONT></I> the puzzling out of a chain of inferences. If <B><FONT color=blue>deduction</FONT></B> is used in reaching an inference, <I><FONT color=brown>reasoning</FONT></I> proceeds from general premises regarded as proved or true and reaches a particular, specific conclusion. [All men are mortal; I am a man; therefore, I am mortal.] <I><FONT color=brown>Induction</FONT></I> is the opposite process in which <I><FONT color=brown>reasoning</FONT></I> collects all the particulars that relate to a problem and draws a general conclusion that explains their behaviour. [Every man whom he knew of had died, sooner or later. Therefore, all men are mortal.] The laws of science, such as the law of gravity, are first <I><FONT color=brown>inductions</FONT></I> from particulars. Once these laws are considered valid, they become the basis for any amount of <I><FONT color=brown>deductions</FONT></I> provided that these are derived according to the rules of logic.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Think">THINK</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in meaning to express disapproval, either mildly or sharply, of some fault or misdeed. To <B><FONT color=blue>rebuke</FONT></B> is to criticize or call down with sharpness, and often with abruptness, usually in the midst of some action or course of action: to <I><FONT color=brown>rebuke</FONT></I> a worker whose clumsiness was responsible for the complete breakdown of operations in his department.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Admonish</FONT></B> and reprove indicate mild forms of disapproval. <I><FONT color=brown>Admonish</FONT></I> may be used in giving warning or counsel where no wrong is implied and often simply refers to duty which might have been forgotten, or might be in the future: to <I><FONT color=brown>admonish</FONT></I> a student about the lateness of his assignments. <B><FONT color=blue>Reprove</FONT></B> also suggests mild or even friendly criticism designed less to chasten than to help correct a fault or pattern of misbehaviour: to <I><FONT color=brown>reprove</FONT></I> a child for telling fibs.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>reproach</FONT></B> is to express the kind of disapproval that arises from a personal hurt, anger or grief at someone’s thoughtlessness or selfishness: <I><FONT color=brown>reproaching</FONT></I> her husband for having forgotten their wedding anniversary.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Censure</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>reprimand</FONT></B> agree in indicating a formal and, usually, public or official disapproval. <I><FONT color=brown>Reprimand</FONT></I> suggests a direct confrontation between the offender and his critic; one may <I><FONT color=brown>censure</FONT></I> directly or indirectly: the judge who sharply <I><FONT color=brown>reprimanded</FONT></I> a witness for being evasive and uncooperative; to <I><FONT color=brown>censure</FONT></I> a politician for flagrantly violating parliamentary standards of ethical behaviour; a newspaper editorial that <I><FONT color=brown>censured</FONT></I> misuse of government vehicles.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Disapproval">DISAPPROVAL</A>, <A href="entry://Scold">SCOLD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Endorse">ENDORSE</A>, <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>reckless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>daredevil</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>foolhardy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rash</FONT></B>:

<P>These words apply to persons and actions that show a heedless defiance of danger and a seeming lack of regard for consequences. <B><FONT color=blue>Reckless</FONT></B> and rash are applied to persons acting, or actions undertaken, without regard for the risks involved in terms of the end sought. <I><FONT color=brown>Reckless</FONT></I> implies wild, irresponsible action or emotion, indicating at worst a dangerous lack of self-discipline or self-control, and implying at the least a devil-may-care attitude or a frightening absence of forethought. The word indicates extreme carelessness or unconcern in respect of oneself or others. What distinguishes a <I><FONT color=brown>reckless</FONT></I> act from a brave one is not always the action itself but rather the attitude motivating it and the circumstances behind it. A police car or fire engine may, with siren sounding, drive at great speed through the streets and through red traffic lights without being <I><FONT color=brown>reckless</FONT></I>. A motorist doing the same thing would be guilty of careless and <I><FONT color=brown>reckless</FONT></I> driving. <B><FONT color=blue>Rash</FONT></B> is not quite so extreme as <I><FONT color=brown>reckless</FONT></I>. It points to overhasty action taken in the heat or emotion of the moment, without due caution or regard for consequnces. [Quitting his job in anger was a <I><FONT color=brown>rash</FONT></I> action which he later regretted; Don’t do anything <I><FONT color=brown>rash</FONT></I>.] A <I><FONT color=brown>rash</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>reckless</FONT></I> accusation is one that disregards the possible consequnces to both the accused and the accuser, who himself might be used for libel.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Foolhardy</FONT></B> is more informal than rash or reckless. It implies boldness exercised without consideration or judgement, pointing to action that is daringly <I><FONT color=brown>reckless</FONT></I> or downright foolish. A <I><FONT color=brown>foolhardy</FONT></I> person rushes into peril from lack of forethought. Swimming out beyond one’s depth when tired, or after eating, is a <I><FONT color=brown>foolhardy</FONT></I> action. <B><FONT color=blue>Daredevil</FONT></B> differs from the other words in indicating the deliberate taking of chance, with a certain implication of calculated risk. It points to some sort of public exhibition, often describing a professional who performs sensational feats to entertain thrill-seekers: a <I><FONT color=brown>daredevil</FONT></I> racing driver; a <I><FONT color=brown>daredevil</FONT></I> stunt pilot. <I><FONT color=brown>Daredevil</FONT></I> further suggests a certain amount of flair and debonair defiance: a death-defying trapeze artist performing <I><FONT color=brown>daredevil</FONT></I> feats.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Brave">BRAVE</A>, <A href="entry://Daring">DARING</A>, <A href="entry://Heedless">HEEDLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Impetuous">IMPETUOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: calculating, <A href="entry://Careful">CAREFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Cautious">CAUTIOUS</A>, chary.</P>

<P>These words refer to oral or written assistance given to someone who is trying to decide upon a course of action. <B><FONT color=blue>Recommend</FONT></B> indicates a positive declaration in favour of a particular alternative or set of possibilities: <I><FONT color=brown>recommending</FONT></I> a complete change of occupation that would give his life new meaning; <I><FONT color=brown>recommending</FONT></I> ten books as absolutely necessary to any understanding of the question he had raised. The word can apply equally well to situations in which help has or has not been solicited: <I><FONT color=brown>recommending</FONT></I> a walk before breakfast to everyone he met; asking him to <I><FONT color=brown>recommend</FONT></I> a good tailor. <B><FONT color=blue>Advocate</FONT></B> is the most like <I><FONT color=brown>recommend</FONT></I> of the rest of these words in emphasizing a positive declaration on the part of the person giving assistance; drawn from legal terminology, it is even stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>recommend</FONT></I> in suggesting an ardent espousal of a given course of action: <I><FONT color=brown>advocating</FONT></I> complete abstinence as the only way of combating his alcoholism. In this context, the word can imply a pugnacious tenacity or an unwelcome intrusion: <I><FONT color=brown>advocating</FONT></I> his pet theories on sexual adjustment to people far less disturbed than he. <B><FONT color=blue>Prescribe</FONT></B> compares with <I><FONT color=brown>advocate</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>recommend</FONT></I> in that a positive statement is made, but it is more specific in relating mainly to a doctor-patient relationship in which the doctor <I><FONT color=brown>prescribes</FONT></I> remedies for an ailment. In this context, the patient has sought the doctor’s assistance and is usually not compelled to abide by what is <I><FONT color=brown>recommended</FONT></I>. This gives it a less ardent, more matter-of-fact tone than <I><FONT color=brown>advocate</FONT></I>, but a more authoritative cast than <I><FONT color=brown>recommend</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>prescribing</FONT></I> a good dinner and an exciting film as the best way to cure his gloomy frame of mind.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Advise</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>suggest</FONT></B> are much milder than the foregoing words. They do not necessarily indicate that any one alternative is recommended as a solution to the problem in question. <I><FONT color=brown>Advise</FONT></I> implies an extensive and detailed examination of a person’s situation, however informally, with several possibilities for action opened up simply by getting another vantage point on his difficulties: <I><FONT color=brown>advising</FONT></I> me on what to expect from the university I had chosen to attend. When used as an exact substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>recommend</FONT></I>, it nevertheless adds an implication of politeness or of reluctance to seem overbearing. [May I <I><FONT color=brown>advise</FONT></I> you not to lend him large sums of money?; Would you <I><FONT color=brown>advise</FONT></I> me where I should spend my holidays this summer?] <I><FONT color=brown>Suggest</FONT></I> implies a single, every tentative proposal that is not insisted upon: in <I><FONT color=brown>advising</FONT></I> me, he <I><FONT color=brown>suggested</FONT></I> several possibilities for revision. In some cases, the tentativeness implied by the word may result from fear of being rejected: <I><FONT color=brown>suggesting</FONT></I> timidly that a night out would be enjoyable for both of them.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Counsel</FONT></B> has come to have a specific reference to psychologists or guidance personnel at school or universities: <I><FONT color=brown>counselling</FONT></I> students on the importance of matching aptitude to career. In other uses, it still implies some quasi-official situation, with a stress on seriousness and formality: contending factions who <I><FONT color=brown>counselled</FONT></I> the mayor in secret. In ordinary uses, the word is more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>advise</FONT></I>, sometimes excessively so: <I><FONT color=brown>counselling</FONT></I> her daughter on how to behave at the ball.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Advice">ADVICE</A>, <A href="entry://Induce">INDUCE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to getting back something that has been lost. <B><FONT color=blue>Recover</FONT></B> is the most general; it can refer to finding a lost item by chance or accident as easily as by intention and effort: <I><FONT color=brown>recovering</FONT></I> the other slipper while searching the hall cupboard one day for something else; <I><FONT color=brown>recovering</FONT></I> his position of eminence among his fellow scientists only in the last days of his life. Most concretely, <B><FONT color=blue>retrieve</FONT></B> suggests something that has not so much been lost as slipped beyond reach, and requires some effort to <I><FONT color=brown>recover</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>retrieving</FONT></I> the floating paddle by leaning out along the prow of the canoe.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Recoup</FONT></B> is drawn from legal terminology to mean, in ordinary use, a <I><FONT color=brown>recovering</FONT></I> of something similar to or equivalent to a disastrous or negligent loss: <I><FONT color=brown>recouping</FONT></I> his losses at the racecourse by embezzling funds from his bank. Like <I><FONT color=brown>recover</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>regain</FONT></I> stresses getting back the very thing lost, but in contrast it tends to be restricted to a deliberate and laborious search or effort: <I><FONT color=brown>regaining</FONT></I> the hill lost the night before to the enemy; <I><FONT color=brown>regaining</FONT></I> his eyesight after several operations; <I><FONT color=brown>regaining</FONT></I> the heavyweight championship in last week’s fight.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Reclaim</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>restore</FONT></B> both suggest bringing something back to its original condition; <I><FONT color=brown>reclaim</FONT></I> is used largely of land or extensive areas, <I><FONT color=brown>restore</FONT></I> of buildings or art objects: <I><FONT color=brown>reclaiming</FONT></I> good farmlands from the polluted swaps; <I><FONT color=brown>restoring</FONT></I> the house to the way it might have looked in the 1820s. <I><FONT color=brown>Reclaim</FONT></I> may also suggest an interval in which the right to a position or to a property has been transferred or disputed: <I><FONT color=brown>reclaiming</FONT></I> his title to the inheritance after a protracted legal battle.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conserve">CONSERVE</A>, <A href="entry://Repair">REPAIR</A>, <A href="entry://Save">SAVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Mislay">MISLAY</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to make or to become smaller or less, but they are not in all cases interchangeable. <B><FONT color=blue>Reduce</FONT></B> has a wider range of connotations than the other words and is also the most general. It means to make less in size, amount, number, extent or intensity: to <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I> household expenses; to <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I> a labour force during a slack season; to <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I> speed on a highway undergoing repairs; to <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I> the acreage of a property by selling off several paddocks. <I><FONT color=brown>Reduce</FONT></I> further means to bring to an inferior rank, position or financial condition: a widow <I><FONT color=brown>reduced</FONT></I> to letting rooms to make ends meet: a sergeant <I><FONT color=brown>reduced</FONT></I> to private after a court-martial; a pampered woman <I><FONT color=brown>reduced</FONT></I> to doing her own housework because of a shortage of domestic help. When applied to losing weight, especially when deliberate, <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I> is popularly used intransitively: My mother and aunts are always trying new diets in order to <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abate</FONT></B> means to <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I>, as in strength or degree, usually from an excessive intensity or amount. In this sense, it is most frequently an intransitive verb. [The anguished screams in the night began to <I><FONT color=brown>abate</FONT></I> when the police arrived; After taking aspirin, she found her pain <I><FONT color=brown>abating</FONT></I>.] In a legal sense, abate is used transitively and means to do away with completely or to make null and void in whole or in part: to <I><FONT color=brown>abate</FONT></I> a nuisance; to <I><FONT color=brown>abate</FONT></I> rent.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Curtail</FONT></B> is to <B><FONT color=blue>reduce</FONT></B> abruptly and radically, as by cutting off or cutting shorter than was originally intended. The word is used chiefly of nonmaterial things and conveys the idea of the unexpected: a holiday <I><FONT color=brown>curtailed</FONT></I> by a gale-force wind that damaged their cottage; to <I><FONT color=brown>curtail</FONT></I> a pointless argument by turning on one’s heel and leaving the room; to <I><FONT color=brown>curtail</FONT></I> useless government spending.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Diminish</FONT></B> is a more accurate word than <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I> when one wishes to stress the idea of removing part of something so that there is a manifest and sometimes progressive lessening, but not to the point of total disappearance. The word may suggest either the loss of something valuable or a lessening of that which is undesirable. [As people approach old age their energy may <I><FONT color=brown>diminish</FONT></I>; As his confidence in his work increased, his anxieties about it <I><FONT color=brown>diminished</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lower</FONT></B> is to make less, especially in value, degree or level. It is not as emphatic or precise a word as <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I> in this sense, although fairly close in meaning: to <I><FONT color=brown>lower</FONT></I> prices on shop-soiled goods; to <I><FONT color=brown>reduce</FONT></I> payments on a mortgage. In extended senses, <I><FONT color=brown>lower</FONT></I> points to a lessening by undermining or weakening. [He could not bear to <I><FONT color=brown>lower</FONT></I> himself to ask relatives for help; Frequent colds <I><FONT color=brown>lower</FONT></I> one’s resistance to more serious infections.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Decrease">DECREASE</A>, <A href="entry://Lessen">LESSEN</A>, <A href="entry://Wane">WANE</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: enhance, <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Escalate">ESCALATE</A>, <A href="entry://Extend">EXTEND</A>, raise.</P>

<P>These words mean to be unwilling to accept, receive or take into account a person or thing. <B><FONT color=blue>Reject</FONT></B> is to fail to accept or grant, and caries overtones of casting aside as useless, value less or unsuitable. [The judge <I><FONT color=brown>rejected</FONT></I> the prisoner’s appeal for a new trial; The idea that the earth is flat was <I><FONT color=brown>rejected</FONT></I> centuries ago.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Refuse</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>decline</FONT></B> both mean to fail to comply with or to do something. <I><FONT color=brown>Refuse</FONT></I> is the stronger of the two words, often stressing firmness and sometimes even rudeness: to <I><FONT color=brown>refuse</FONT></I> to obey an order. It also suggests the idea of withholding: to <I><FONT color=brown>refuse</FONT></I> money to a beggar; to <I><FONT color=brown>refuse</FONT></I> to discuss the proposition. <I><FONT color=brown>Decline</FONT></I>, on the other hand, is to refuse politely and is applicable to invitations to social events, or to a courteous offer of help: to <I><FONT color=brown>decline</FONT></I> an invitation to a dinner party; a blind man who smilingly <I><FONT color=brown>declined</FONT></I> to be helped across the street. <I><FONT color=brown>Decline</FONT></I> may be used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>refuse</FONT></I> when an atmosphere of formality prevails: The witness <I><FONT color=brown>declined</FONT></I> to answer certain questions put to him. <B><FONT color=blue>Knock back</FONT></B> is a very informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>refuse</FONT></I> in contexts where something if offered; she <I><FONT color=brown>knocked back</FONT></I> his proposal.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Repudiate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>spurn</FONT></B> emphasize more pointedly than the foregoing words a refusal to recognize or have anything to do with a person or thing. <I><FONT color=brown>Repudiate</FONT></I> (which once meant to cast off or divorce a wife) points to a disowning or rejection of something once held more or less dear: to <I><FONT color=brown>repudiate</FONT></I> one’s religious beliefs; an author who <I><FONT color=brown>repudiates</FONT></I> the revolutionary ideas expressed in his earlier work; to <I><FONT color=brown>repudiate</FONT></I> one’s relatives because of their critical attitude. Derived from an Old English word meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>kick out</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>spurn</FONT></I> emphasizes even more strongly the idea of driving or pushing away roughly and contemptuously: <I><FONT color=brown>spurning</FONT></I> the attentions of a man whom she despised; <I><FONT color=brown>spurning</FONT></I> the suggestion that he should get his hair cut and put on a clean shirt; <I><FONT color=brown>spurning</FONT></I> a door-to-door salesman.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Discard">DISCARD</A>, <A href="entry://Remove">REMOVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: accept, <A href="entry://Acknowledge">ACKNOWLEDGE</A>, <A href="entry://Demand">DEMAND</A>.</P>

<P>These words apply primarily to something said or written to satisfy or acknowledge a question, call, request, charge, etc. <B><FONT color=blue>Answer</FONT></B> is the most general word in this list, and though all the words here considered may be used figuratively of actions as well as words, <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I> is more variously used than any of them. When a question is asked, any words or action in return may be called an <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I>: a prompt <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I> to a letter; His <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I> was an uppercut to the jaw. Indeed, any satisfactory conclusion may be styled an <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I>: He had hoped that divorce would be the <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I> to all his problems. An <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I> in the form of a statement appropriate to the question is a <B><FONT color=blue>reply</FONT></B>: His <I><FONT color=brown>reply</FONT></I> to the request was a firm "No!"</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>response</FONT></B> is the reaction to a stimulus: Pavlov’s experiments proved that a conditioned <I><FONT color=brown>response</FONT></I> to a given stimulus could be induced in rats by the learned association of the right <I><FONT color=brown>response</FONT></I> with satisfaction and of the wrong <I><FONT color=brown>response</FONT></I> with pain. In more general use <I><FONT color=brown>response</FONT></I> refers to any <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I> to an urgent question or appeal, or to a set <I><FONT color=brown>question</FONT></I>: a response to a cry for help; the <I><FONT color=brown>responses</FONT></I> of a litany. A <I><FONT color=brown>reply</FONT></I> to a <I><FONT color=brown>reply</FONT></I> is a <B><FONT color=blue>rejoinder</FONT></B>, often in the form of a second question or demand; this word is particularly applicable to the give-and-take of a debate: a telling <I><FONT color=brown>rejoinder</FONT></I> which left his opponent momentarily speechless. <B><FONT color=blue>Riposte</FONT></B>, form the Italian word for <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I>, first meant a return thrust in fencing. By extension, it came to be applied to a verbal duel, meaning a quick, clever, retaliatory <I><FONT color=brown>reply</FONT></I>: a brilliant, if somewhat savage, <I><FONT color=brown>riposte</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>retort</FONT></B> is a sharp answer, as to an accusation or criticism.

<P>These words are alike in meaning to let go or give up. <B><FONT color=blue>Relinquish</FONT></B> is the most general and neutral term in the group. It can indicate no more than the release of one’s grasp: He <I><FONT color=brown>relinquished</FONT></I> the oars. It can denote the letting go from one’s direction or possession, usually voluntarily but sometimes reluctantly. [A parent <I><FONT color=brown>relinquishes</FONT></I> control over grown children; A creditor may <I><FONT color=brown>relinquish</FONT></I> a claim in consideration of a concession.] <B><FONT color=blue>Surrender</FONT></B> means to give up under compulsion to any person, passion, influence or power: he <I><FONT color=brown>surrendered</FONT></I> his savings to his creditors. <B><FONT color=blue>Yield</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>surrender</FONT></I>, but implies milder compulsion and therefore some softness, concession, respect or eve affection on the part of the person who <I><FONT color=brown>yields</FONT></I>: He <I><FONT color=brown>yielded</FONT></I> the floor to his opponent. <B><FONT color=blue>Cede</FONT></B> means to give up, usually by legal transfer or as the result of a treaty; it is most often used in reference to the concession of territory: France <I><FONT color=brown>ceded</FONT></I> Alsce-Lorraine to Germany in 1871.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abdicate</FONT></B> and <I><FONT color=brown>resign</FONT></I> refer to the formal giving up of some office or position along with its attendant rights, power, etc. <I><FONT color=brown>abdicate</FONT></I> specifically applies to a monarch’s relinquishment of his throne; <I><FONT color=brown>resign</FONT></I> is used to designate the action of a prime minister, some other elected or appointed official, or a person working in business: when George III threatened to <I><FONT color=brown>abdicate</FONT></I> his throne; forced to <I><FONT color=brown>resign</FONT></I> his position as chairman of the board because of ill health. <B><FONT color=blue>Renounce</FONT></B> means to declare against or to give up formally and definitively: to <I><FONT color=brown>renounce</FONT></I> the pomps and vanities of the world; to <I><FONT color=brown>renounce</FONT></I> one’s citizenship. When used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>abdicate</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>renounce</FONT></I> suggests that the giving up is done for something considered to be more important: Edward VIII <I><FONT color=brown>renounced</FONT></I> his throne for the love of a woman.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Abstain">ABSTAIN</A>, <A href="entry://Forgo">FORGO</A>, <A href="entry://Forswear">FORSWEAR</A>, RESIGN (leave).</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: cherish, claim, maintain, <A href="entry://Possess">POSSESS</A>.</P>

<P>These words all mean to continue in one place. <B><FONT color=blue>Remain</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stay</FONT></B> are often used interchangeably. In its narrower application, <I><FONT color=brown>remain</FONT></I> means to continue in one place after the removal, departure or destruction of other persons or things, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>stay</FONT></I> implies the temporary continuance in one place of a guest, resident or the like. [Only the shell of the building <I><FONT color=brown>remained</FONT></I> after the explosion; He was invited to <I><FONT color=brown>stay</FONT></I> for supper.] If the fact that others have left is made explicit, either word may be used: He <I><FONT color=brown>remained</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>stayed</FONT></I>) in his seat after all the other students had gone home. But if the writer’s intention is to contrast <I><FONT color=brown>staying</FONT></I> with leaving, remain has more impact. [All had left their seats and gone home hours ago; he remained.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abide</FONT></B>, as here considered, means to <I><FONT color=brown>stay</FONT></I> somewhere a long time, and often connotes residing. <I><FONT color=brown>Abide</FONT></I> is a formal word, and is often used in legal or other contexts requiring a word neutral in emotional connotation and precise in meaning: The child <I><FONT color=brown>abided</FONT></I> with his grandparents for three and a half years before being returned to his home.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Linger</FONT></B> implies reluctance to leave, usually because what one is doing is pleasant; to <B><FONT color=blue>tarry</FONT></B> is to stay beyond the proper time for leaving, and more strongly than <I><FONT color=brown>linger</FONT></I> implies excessive delay. Tarry is not commonly used today apart from consciously stylized, rhetorical or old-fashioned contexts; it has a romantic ring to it that makes it inappropriate in prosaic contexts. [After making his speech, the candidate <I><FONT color=brown>lingered</FONT></I> in the hall to shake the hands of enthusiastic supporters; <I><FONT color=brown>Tarry</FONT></I> not with your loved one, but join us in righteous battle.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Delay">DELAY</A>, <A href="entry://Reside">RESIDE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Go">GO</A>, <A href="entry://Leave">LEAVE</A> (depart).</P>

<P>These words refer to the act of summoning up the past, to its spontaneous cropping up in the mind, or to the fixing of present data in the memory for future reference. <B><FONT color=blue>Remember</FONT></B> can refer generally to any mental glance at the past, voluntary or involuntary: he caught himself <I><FONT color=brown>remembering</FONT></I> how his first wife would have cooked the same meal; struggling to <I><FONT color=brown>remember</FONT></I> where he had been at the time the incident took place. Often the word specifically suggests the staying power of a vivid past event for circumstance: I can still <I><FONT color=brown>remember</FONT></I> every detail in my old dormitory room at school. <B><FONT color=blue>Recall</FONT></B> is more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>remember</FONT></I> and more often indicates a voluntary summoning up of the past, whether silently for oneself or verbally for others. [He <I><FONT color=brown>recalled</FONT></I> his last evening with his fiancée whenever he felt depressed; In his closing speech to the jury, the crown prosecutor <I><FONT color=brown>recalled</FONT></I> the mass of incriminating evidence he had developed during the trial.] But, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>remember</FONT></I>, the word can refer to something in the present that resembles something in the past, and thereafter calls it up: a view that <I><FONT color=brown>recalled</FONT></I> to him the fishing village in which he had stayed during the war. <B><FONT color=blue>Remind</FONT></B> concentrates more exclusively on this last possibility for recall: a man who <I><FONT color=brown>reminded</FONT></I> her of her first lover. But <I><FONT color=brown>remind</FONT></I> can also suggest a conscious effort to ensure that something will be <I><FONT color=brown>remembered</FONT></I> in the future: a note on his calendar to <I><FONT color=brown>remind</FONT></I> himself of their luncheon date; a monument to <I><FONT color=brown>remind</FONT></I> future generations of the sacrifices made on their behalf.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Recollect</FONT></B> is very similar in sense to remember and recall: I don’t rightly <I><FONT color=brown>recollect</FONT></I> when I saw her last. But the word can apply also to the act of casting one’s mind back over past events in a leisurely and ruminative manner, whether silently to oneself or verbally to others. It can suggest the active process of piecing together dimly <I><FONT color=brown>remembered</FONT></I> and half-forgotten details: He settled back with great relish and began to <I><FONT color=brown>recollect</FONT></I> those battles in the war that he had witnessed at first hand. <B><FONT color=blue>Reminisce</FONT></B> is exclusively restricted to this last use of <I><FONT color=brown>recollect</FONT></I>, adding a positive note of pleasant nostalgia; the word may also suggest a tendency to dwell on or brood over the past: daydreams during which she <I><FONT color=brown>reminisced</FONT></I> a great deal about the life she had lived before her marriage; cronies who sit around <I><FONT color=brown>reminiscing</FONT></I> about their vanished yesterdays.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Retain</FONT></B> can point to the staying power of a memory that often comes to mind involuntarily or without effort: He had always <I><FONT color=brown>retained</FONT></I> a picture of his father decked out in riding gear. In more neutral uses, the word can involve the question of mentally holding on to facts or details that one is trying to learn: a test to measure how much of the reading exercise each person had <I><FONT color=brown>retained</FONT></I> after a given passage of time. <B><FONT color=blue>Memorize</FONT></B> is much more specifically directed to this situation, indicating a conscious and laborious effort to commit something to memory in exact detail: actors who are good at quickly <I><FONT color=brown>memorizing</FONT></I> their parts; a last look in which he tried to <I><FONT color=brown>memorize</FONT></I> every line and angle of her face.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Review</FONT></B> suggests an orderly summoning up of the past in summary form, applying particularly to past lessons or to facts one is trying to <I><FONT color=brown>memorize</FONT></I>: a final week to <I><FONT color=brown>review</FONT></I> the material before the exam; <I><FONT color=brown>reviewing</FONT></I> each aspect of their plan, step by step, before synchronizing their watches and setting off.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://History">HISTORY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Forget">FORGET</A>, ignore, repress, suppress.</P>

<P>These words refer to getting rid of something or forcibly moving it to a new position. <B><FONT color=blue>Remove</FONT></B> is the most general of these and the most colourless. It ranges in tone from neutral or factual description to suggestions of rejection, disapproval or the use of force: <I><FONT color=brown>removing</FONT></I> the record from its sleeve; <I><FONT color=brown>removing</FONT></I> the sheets from the bed; <I><FONT color=brown>removing</FONT></I> a corrupt administrator from office; ordering the Serjeant-at-Arms to <I><FONT color=brown>remove</FONT></I> the angry man from the courtroom.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dismiss</FONT></B> is less likely to suggest the use of force, but otherwise is richer in connotations than <I><FONT color=brown>remove</FONT></I>. It can mean the routine release or sending away of an inferior by his superior: <I><FONT color=brown>dismissing</FONT></I> the servant after the guests were ushered in; <I><FONT color=brown>dismissing</FONT></I> the class promptly at three o’clock. It can suggest the routine or disapproving termination of employment: <I><FONT color=brown>dismissing</FONT></I> with thanks the special consultant on the complete project; <I><FONT color=brown>dismissing</FONT></I> his secretary because of her incessant lateness. More pertinently here, the word can suggest a swift, abrupt or final rejection. [She <I><FONT color=brown>dismissed</FONT></I> his proposal with an imperious wave of her hand; We <I><FONT color=brown>dismissed</FONT></I> the whole idea of cycling to the west coast.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Eliminate</FONT></B>, at its mildest, pertains to the routine or methodical disposal of something: organs that <I><FONT color=brown>eliminate</FONT></I> wastes from the body; <I><FONT color=brown>eliminating</FONT></I> from the list those books she had already read. More highly charged, the word can suggest determination, if not force: <I><FONT color=brown>eliminating</FONT></I> from the club those members whose dues were in arrears. At its most extreme, the word can suggest ruthless or systematic destruction: a wave of killings as one group of gangsters set about <I><FONT color=brown>eliminating</FONT></I> its rivals; concentration camps built to <I><FONT color=brown>eliminate</FONT></I> those considered to be enemies of the state.</P><P>The remaining words are all more specific in pointing to the use of considerable force to <I><FONT color=brown>remove</FONT></I> something, although none suggest destruction like <I><FONT color=brown>eliminate</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Oust</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>evict</FONT></B> emphasize the resistance given by the thing being <I><FONT color=brown>removed</FONT></I> from its previous position. <I><FONT color=brown>Oust</FONT></I> is restricted to those implications of the previous words pertaining to termination of employment or discharge from office: <I><FONT color=brown>ousted</FONT></I> from the party leadership by a no-confidence vote; a revolution fomented to <I><FONT color=brown>oust</FONT></I> the notorious dictator from power. <I><FONT color=brown>Evict</FONT></I> is even more specific in applying exclusively to <I><FONT color=brown>removing</FONT></I> tenants from occupancy; most often, the word suggests the gaining of legal approval to carry out this act: bailiffs who <I><FONT color=brown>evicted</FONT></I> the family by carrying its belongings out to the footpath.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Expel</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>eject</FONT></B> may both suggest a forcible removing from office or occupancy like the previous pair, but they are more general than any of these words except <I><FONT color=brown>remove</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Expel</FONT></I> has its own area of special relevance in applying to the punitive <I><FONT color=brown>dismissing</FONT></I> of a student from school for unsatisfactory behaviour: students <I><FONT color=brown>expelled</FONT></I> for cheating. <I><FONT color=brown>Eject</FONT></I> is the most emphatic of this group in stressing the use of force; it pertains most appropriately to a physical or bodily removal: a spent cartridge that had been <I><FONT color=brown>ejected</FONT></I> by the rifle; calling the police to <I><FONT color=brown>eject</FONT></I> the demonstration from the lobby.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, <A href="entry://Exile">EXILE</A>, <A href="entry://Move">MOVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Possess">POSSESS</A>, retain.</P>

<P>These words pertain to people, usually men, who live outside society and its laws. <B><FONT color=blue>Renegade</FONT></B> originally applied to a Christian who converted to Islam and more generally to any religious or even political apostate. Some of these general uses are still met with: a <I><FONT color=brown>renegade</FONT></I> priest who left the church to marry. But Western fiction and films have popularized the term to apply to any fugitive or lawbreaker, particularly to someone, such as a member of a band of robbers, who lives outside or on the periphery of respectable society: the final scene in which the good guys shoot it out with the <I><FONT color=brown>renegades</FONT></I>. Now, the word can apply most generally to any member of a sub-culture of thieves or delinquents: a section of the city frequented by rogues and <I><FONT color=brown>renegades</FONT></I>. If the reference is to a young person, the word may imply that he has run away from home: <I><FONT color=brown>renegade</FONT></I> youths who gather in low-class dives and sleep in sleazy rooming-houses.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Desperado</FONT></B> refers most specifically to a bandit of the U.S. West or South-West in frontier days; again, Westerns have popularized the term, but it has fewer general uses applying to other situations: the villains of the film were a band of <I><FONT color=brown>desperadoes</FONT></I> who hid out in a cave near the town. <B><FONT color=blue>Outlaw</FONT></B> can also apply within the context of the Western, much like desperado or <I><FONT color=brown>renegade</FONT></I>, but it has a much wider areas of relevance than either of these, applying to any habitual lawbreaker, especially one who totally rejects the standards of society as a guide to conduct: the Chicago of the twenties ?a city completely controlled by <I><FONT color=brown>outlaws</FONT></I> who raked off millions from various kinds of racketeering. The more common use of the word, however, emphasizes that the lawbreaker is fleeing the law and has been deprived of its protection because of his crime: an <I><FONT color=brown>outlaw</FONT></I> with a price on his head.</P><P>The remaining words have no particular relevance to the Western genre. Closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>outlaw</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>criminal</FONT></B> is the most general word here, referring to any hardened lawbreaker, whether he acts alone or in concert with others. Usually the word suggests someone guilty of serious and repeated offences, whether or not he has been apprehended or punished for his crimes: to be declared a habitual <I><FONT color=brown>criminal</FONT></I>; a small-time <I><FONT color=brown>criminal</FONT></I> who stole cars to support his drug addiction. Sometimes the word can be a substitute for convict or ex-convict, applying to someone who is or has been imprisoned for a serious crimes: <I><FONT color=brown>criminals</FONT></I> who return to their old haunts upon parole.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crook</FONT></B> is an informal word for <I><FONT color=brown>criminal</FONT></I>, and implies membership in a gang or a criminal who works alone. It can suggest the use of deceit to fleece or defraud unsuspecting people, but, at its most general, it can apply to anyone involved in any form of crime: <I><FONT color=brown>crooks</FONT></I> who ran an organized shop-lifting racket; The cashier was a <I><FONT color=brown>crook</FONT></I> who had embezzled thousands of dollars from the firm. <B><FONT color=blue>Racketeer</FONT></B> refers in a general way to anyone who makes his living by shady or unlawful means. <I><FONT color=brown>Racketeering</FONT></I> usually suggests big-time, organized crime rather than petty law-breaking, and depends for its success largely on the participation of the public, as in S.P. betting, drug peddling, gambling, etc.: The <I><FONT color=brown>racketeer</FONT></I> faced the court on seven charges, of which extortion was the least serious. <B><FONT color=blue>Gangster</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mobster</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>gunman</FONT></B> all imply membership in a gang whose activities are violent in nature, but the words overlap in meaning so that one or all of them can apply to the same person. A <I><FONT color=brown>mobster</FONT></I> is generally a gang or mob leader, although he may be simply a member. <I><FONT color=brown>Gangster</FONT></I> can refer to any member of a gang; more than <I><FONT color=brown>criminal</FONT></I>, it suggests violence and ruthlessness: a <I><FONT color=brown>gangster</FONT></I> who would shoot his best friend if it suited his purpose. The word is occasionally used to describe people who are brutal in their disregard for the rights of others: <I><FONT color=brown>gangsters</FONT></I> of the Hitler régime. <I><FONT color=brown>Gunman</FONT></I> is self-explanatory, denoting a vicious member of the underworld noted for his ready use of firearms. He is usually a gang member who is allotted the specific task of threatening or killing victims: They were forced to remain in the room under the surveillance of a trigger-happy <I><FONT color=brown>gunman</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hoodlum</FONT></B> at its most specific suggests the bodyguards or toughs who surround the leader of a gang. Where other words here carry on implications about age, <I><FONT color=brown>hoodlum</FONT></I> often suggests a brutal or coarse young man: The <I><FONT color=brown>mobster</FONT></I> assigned a dozen <I><FONT color=brown>hoodlums</FONT></I> to intimidate small shopkeepers. In extended uses, <I><FONT color=brown>hoodlum</FONT></I> can apply to young men who belong to no organized gang but who, as small-time <I><FONT color=brown>criminals</FONT></I>, indulge in spontaneous acts of violence: a bunch of <I><FONT color=brown>hoodlums</FONT></I> who began wrecking the hamburger café out of sheer boredom. <B><FONT color=blue>Hood</FONT></B>, a shortened form, suggests even more clearly young delinquents who are anarchic and lawless in their behaviour: local <I><FONT color=brown>hoods</FONT></I> standing along the footpath flipping coins and trying to look tough. <B><FONT color=blue>Thug</FONT></B> comes from the Hindi word for thief and originally referred to professional robbers in India who murdered their victims by strangulation. Now it can serve as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>hoodlum</FONT></I> in reference to burly, lower-echelon members of a gang who are coarse and brutal and who may be paid to assault or kill designated victims: an informer who had been murdered by one of the gang’s <I><FONT color=brown>thugs</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sociopath</FONT></B> is a recent term used to describe a mentally disturbed person, usually a young man, whose psychosis takes the form of hideous acts of gratuitous violence. Theoretically, a <I><FONT color=brown>sociopath</FONT></I> has failed to develop into a human being and cannot understand, emotionally or intellectually, human affection, compassion or suffering: a growing number of <I><FONT color=brown>sociopath</FONT></I> who, without warning, go on killing sprees for no apparent reason.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Sentence">CONVICT</A>, <A href="entry://Crime">CRIME</A>, <A href="entry://Thief">THIEF</A>, <A href="entry://Traitor">TRAITOR</A>.</P>

<P>Central to these words is the idea or fact of a return to some previous condition, usually but not always, thought of as desirable. <B><FONT color=blue>Renewal</FONT></B> can apply to anything, good, bad or indifferent, that returns, repeats or begins again after a period of lapse: a <I><FONT color=brown>renewal</FONT></I> of the argument or discussion; the <I><FONT color=brown>renewal</FONT></I> of a lease or mortgage; an unexpected <I><FONT color=brown>renewal</FONT></I> of health and spirits.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rebirth</FONT></B>, in the sense of being born again, has only a figurative use. One can speak of a <I><FONT color=brown>rebirth</FONT></I> as well as a <I><FONT color=brown>renewal</FONT></I> of confidence, but a contractual relationship of limited duration, such as a contract, treaty, copyright or patent, is subject only to <I><FONT color=brown>renewal</FONT></I>. The distinction brings out the idea of an innate, self-sustaining vitality in something that had been or long seemed to be dead: a <I><FONT color=brown>rebirth</FONT></I> of hope.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rejuvenation</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rejuvenescence</FONT></B> simply mean a <I><FONT color=brown>renewal</FONT></I> of youth. With emphasis upon the recovery of lost or fading strength, vigour, alertness or resilience of body and mind. [He looked back upon his trip abroad as having provided a veritable <I><FONT color=brown>rejuvenation</FONT></I>; Disappointment followed his hopes of <I><FONT color=brown>rejuvenescence</FONT></I> after the costly operation.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Recrudescence</FONT></B>, derived from a Latin word meaning to become raw or to bleed again, has its primary use among doctors and surgeons to describe a breaking-out afresh, as of a disease, sore or wound that had appeared to be healing. In this unfavourable sense of a relapse, it may properly be applied to the recurrence of anything considered as evil or objectionable: a <I><FONT color=brown>recrudescence</FONT></I> of an epidemic: a <I><FONT color=brown>recrudescence</FONT></I> of Nazism.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Renaissance</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>renascence</FONT></B> are simply formal words for rebirth and are given special rank as descriptive terms in the history of human culture. <I><FONT color=brown>Renaissance</FONT></I>, the more common spelling, is a French form, while <I><FONT color=brown>renascence</FONT></I> comes from Latin roots meaning to be born again. Either can be used for a widespread awakening of interest in some rediscovered aspect of life or learning, and both imply a sense of discovery and an attendant burst of accomplishment: a <I><FONT color=brown>renaissance</FONT></I> in Asian studies; a literary <I><FONT color=brown>renascence</FONT></I>. The <I><FONT color=brown>renaissance</FONT></I>, spelt with an initial capital, refers to that period of vigorous intellectual and artistic awakening in Western Europe extending from about the 14<SUP>th</SUP> to the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century. This period gave its name to the <I><FONT color=brown>Renaissance</FONT></I> man, full of fresh life, vigour and creativity, whose interest were universal and whose accomplishments were not limited to any one field.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: ageing, loss, subsiding, termination.</P>

<P>These words refer to the change made in something to restore it or to set it right. <B><FONT color=blue>Repair</FONT></B> emphasizes work done on an object that is broken, damaged or not in proper working order: to <I><FONT color=brown>repair</FONT></I> a TV set; to <I><FONT color=brown>repair</FONT></I> shoes; the expense of having an old car <I><FONT color=brown>repaired</FONT></I>. By extension, it can refer to any effective restorative action: ambassadors who worked to <I><FONT color=brown>repair</FONT></I> the breach in trade relations. <B><FONT color=blue>Fix</FONT></B> is an informal word for the same set of meanings as <I><FONT color=brown>repair</FONT></I>: the time it took him to <I><FONT color=brown>fix</FONT></I> the leaking tap. But while <I><FONT color=brown>repair</FONT></I> usually suggests a broken object to begin with, <I><FONT color=brown>fix</FONT></I> can apply to anything that needs attention or has gone awry: <I><FONT color=brown>fixing</FONT></I> curtains for the bare windows; a friend who could <I><FONT color=brown>fix</FONT></I> things between the girl and her angry parents. <B><FONT color=blue>Mend</FONT></B> suggests the <I><FONT color=brown>repairing</FONT></I> of something broken, torn or worn threadbare: a torn page <I><FONT color=brown>mended</FONT></I> with tape; to <I><FONT color=brown>mend</FONT></I> old clothes. But it can go beyond this to suggest a growing together, a knitting and healing of injured parts in living things: tying the bent branch in place until it could <I><FONT color=brown>mend</FONT></I>; splinting the leg until the broken bone began the <I><FONT color=brown>mend</FONT></I>. Thus, it may suggest a return to health and peace in wider contexts: anxious to <I><FONT color=brown>mend</FONT></I> the rift between the two warring factions within his party.</P><P>The remaining words apply less often to the concrete context of a broken object and are both more general and more vague in referring to steps taken to improve something imperfect or to better a bad situation. <B><FONT color=blue>Correct</FONT></B> suggests the supplying of right answers or the pointing out of errors: a special teacher to <I><FONT color=brown>correct</FONT></I> his halting mispronunciations: parents unwilling to <I><FONT color=brown>correct</FONT></I> and discipline their own children. A pedagogical atmosphere is, in fact, often suggested by the word. <B><FONT color=blue>Remedy</FONT></B> more obviously suggests a medical situation, but it appears in a wide range of contexts, implying an effort to find solutions to troublesome or difficult problems: steps taken to <I><FONT color=brown>remedy</FONT></I> the conditions that precipitated the riot. The word may suggest alterations in a system rather than a complete reorganization: They hoped to <I><FONT color=brown>remedy</FONT></I> their lacklustre performance by a few changes in personnel. The word often suggests a search for one out of many possible solutions, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>correct</FONT></I>, which gives the impression that a simple, right-and-wrong dichotomy exists.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rectify</FONT></B>, by contrast, stresses a more thoroughgoing change in something; one <I><FONT color=brown>rectifies</FONT></I> something wrong by setting it right, in so far as amendment is possible: to <I><FONT color=brown>rectify</FONT></I> a factual error; finally <I><FONT color=brown>rectifying</FONT></I> a miscarriage of justice. It is the most formal of these words and, in the sense discussed here, the most abstract. <B><FONT color=blue>Renovate</FONT></B> applies strictly to the <I><FONT color=brown>repairing</FONT></I> and modernizing of an old building: a programme to <I><FONT color=brown>renovate</FONT></I> slum housing. Sometimes, the word can apply to the less desirable modernizing of a venerable or distinctive building merely because it is old or thought out of date: a committee set up to protest the proposal to <I><FONT color=brown>renovate</FONT></I> a row of 19<SUP>th</SUP>-century houses in the street. <B><FONT color=blue>Do up</FONT></B> is a casual, informal expression commonly used in the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>renovate</FONT></I>, but it can apply also to smaller items: They <I><FONT color=brown>did up</FONT></I> the house before the tenants moved in; I'll <I><FONT color=brown>do up</FONT></I> your bicycle in no time at all.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conserve">CONSERVE</A>, <A href="entry://Recover">RECOVER</A>, <A href="entry://Revise">REVISE</A>, <A href="entry://Save">SAVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Break">BREAK</A>, <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, <A href="entry://Replace">REPLACE</A>, <A href="entry://Tear">TEAR</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a situation in which the place of one thing is taken by another. <B><FONT color=blue>Replace</FONT></B> is the most informal and most neutral of these words, referring to any simple substitution for whatever reason: She <I><FONT color=brown>replaced</FONT></I> the amber necklace with a string of pearls to see which she liked better. The word is especially used to indicate the substitution of something new or functioning for something old, worn out or lost: an offer to <I><FONT color=brown>replace</FONT></I> the missing volume of the encyclopaedia; <I><FONT color=brown>replacing</FONT></I> the burnt-out light globe; She <I><FONT color=brown>replaced</FONT></I> the old, battered cushions with new ones.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Displace</FONT></B>, by contrast, indicates the dislodging or forcible removal of one thing by another, without necessarily suggesting that the first had become unusable or ineffective: republics in which new régimes <I><FONT color=brown>displace</FONT></I> old ones with wearying predictability; the growing number of employees being <I><FONT color=brown>displaced</FONT></I> by computers. <B><FONT color=blue>Supplant</FONT></B> is even more restricted than <I><FONT color=brown>displace</FONT></I>, usually suggesting that the old thing is deliberately uprooted, rendered ineffective or wiped out so that the new thing can take over. This process may be immediate or gradual: Europeans who <I><FONT color=brown>supplanted</FONT></I> the indigenous Indian populations they met with; new models and fashions that vie in the stores to <I><FONT color=brown>supplant</FONT></I> on another.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Supersede</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words indicates that a substitution occurs because the new thing is better, more modern or more effective than the old: consumers who have been taught to believe that this year’s models actually <I><FONT color=brown>supersede</FONT></I> those of the year before; economic planning that would slowly <I><FONT color=brown>supersede</FONT></I> older hit-and-miss methods.

<P>These words all refer to undesirable acts or circumstances that are worthy either of criticism, sorrow or pity. <B><FONT color=blue>Reprehensible</FONT></B> exclusively stresses disapproving criticism for egregiously bad behaviour or character: the <I><FONT color=brown>reprehensible</FONT></I> diffidence of public officials in taking stands on the crises of the day; a <I><FONT color=brown>reprehensible</FONT></I> criminal who had robbed great numbers of people without the slightest twinge of regret. <B><FONT color=blue>Opprobrious</FONT></B> is the strongest word in this group. It refers to something that not only merits criticism but looked on with disdain or scorn. There is often an implication of general rather than merely personal censure involved in anything <I><FONT color=brown>opprobrious</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>opprobrious</FONT></I> commercialization of Christmas.</P><P>While <B><FONT color=blue>culpable</FONT></B> refers to something deserving of censure, its main stress may be on an attempt to assign guilt or blame, and hence punishment, for an accident, misdeed or failure: <I><FONT color=brown>culpable</FONT></I> negligence; He displayed <I><FONT color=brown>culpable</FONT></I> ignorance in handling what was only a routine personnel problem. <I><FONT color=brown>Culpable</FONT></I> is milder than the foregoing words in that it would not be used for outrageous or egregious violations of a legal or moral code. <B><FONT color=blue>Blameworthy</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>culpable</FONT></I>, is concerned with assigning guilt for failure or misbehaviour; the tone of the word may be factual and neutral: an investigation to determine which of the officials involved in the recent scandal were the most <I><FONT color=brown>blameworthy</FONT></I>. More generally, the word can express censure, although it seldom suggests the moral outrage of <I><FONT color=brown>opprobrious</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>blameworthy</FONT></I> lack of concern for the impoverished.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Regrettable</FONT></B> is mildest word in this group. It need not denote a critical attitude of censure at all, but rather a sympathetic understanding of someone’s failings: a <I><FONT color=brown>regrettable</FONT></I> lack of decisiveness that marred an otherwise brilliant and accomplished man. It contrasts with the previous words even more dramatically when it expresses pity for circumstances beyond human control: It is <I><FONT color=brown>regrettable</FONT></I> that such a great talent died so young. Sometimes the word is used in a polite or genteel way to express disapproval in terms of sympathetic disappointment: your <I><FONT color=brown>regrettable</FONT></I> absence from my dinner party. The word can even be used more forcefully as an ironic understatement for a severely critical reaction: I find it <I><FONT color=brown>regrettable</FONT></I> that Miss Smith chose to display her inadequacies to us so conclusively by taking on one of the most demanding roles in all of drama.</P><P>In many ways, <B><FONT color=blue>deplorable</FONT></B> is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>regrettable</FONT></I>. On one hand, it can express consternation and distress over what may be no one’s fault: the <I><FONT color=brown>deplorable</FONT></I> accident that crippled her for life. But when it is used critically, it is harsher than <I><FONT color=brown>regrettable</FONT></I> and does not mask its criticism in irony or understatement: <I><FONT color=brown>deplorable</FONT></I> living conditions; a <I><FONT color=brown>deplorable</FONT></I> lack of human compassion. Like <I><FONT color=brown>regrettable</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>deplorable</FONT></I> would not be used for outrageously hardened, cruel or brutal behaviour.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Contemptible">CONTEMPTIBLE</A>, <A href="entry://Disapproval">DISAPPROVAL</A>, <A href="entry://Repulsive">REPULSIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: admirable, <A href="entry://Excellent">EXCELLENT</A>, <A href="entry://Innocent">INNOCENT</A>, praiseworthy.</P>

<P>These words are alike in denoting a person empowered to take the place or position of another. <B><FONT color=blue>Representative</FONT></B> in its wider application means a person or thing that stands for, acts for or takes the place of another. In its narrower application, <I><FONT color=brown>representative</FONT></I> means a person who acts for another or other in a special capacity.

A <B><FONT color=blue>stand-in</FONT></B> is not an <I><FONT color=brown>understudy</FONT></I> but one who relieves the star (usually in films) when he needs to be kept free from unnecessary exertion or danger, or when some particular skill is required: A <I><FONT color=brown>stand-in</FONT></I> was used in the duelling scene. Both these words are used informally in everyday applications: Will you <I><FONT color=brown>stand-in</FONT></I> for me at the dinner?; Better get an <I><FONT color=brown>understudy</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>stand-in</FONT></I>) for the conference if you cold gets any worse.</P><P>In general, <B><FONT color=blue>agent</FONT></B> means one who acts on behalf of another person or a corporate entity by authority. [The treasurer of a club acts as its <I><FONT color=brown>agent</FONT></I> in financial matter; In a dictatorship, all government officials are personal agents of the dictator rather than representatives of the people.] In its more restricted sense, <I><FONT color=brown>agent</FONT></I> means one who acts on behalf of one of two parties. [A real-estate <I><FONT color=brown>agent</FONT></I> acts on behalf of the landlord in transactions between landlord and tenant; A theatrical <I><FONT color=brown>agent</FONT></I> handles business with the producer for his actor-client.]</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>proxy</FONT></B> is one who acts as an agent for another at a ceremony or in an election. [Marriages by <I><FONT color=brown>proxy</FONT></I> occurred during World War II: if the groom was overseas, another person would act as his <I><FONT color=brown>proxy</FONT></I> at the ceremony; Most shareholders vote for directors by <I><FONT color=brown>proxy</FONT></I>; that is, they authorize an <I><FONT color=brown>agent</FONT></I> to vote on their behalf.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Delegate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>deputy</FONT></B> usually refer to <I><FONT color=brown>representatives</FONT></I> who are closely bound by instructions; the use of the title <I><FONT color=brown>representative</FONT></I> rather than <I><FONT color=brown>delegate</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>deputy</FONT></I> often implies a lack of such instructions, or less binding ones. Thus a Parliamentary <I><FONT color=brown>representative</FONT></I>, once he is elected, may be free to vote for or against legislation as he sees fit, but a <I><FONT color=brown>delegate</FONT></I> to a party conference may be required to vote as his branch directs. A <I><FONT color=brown>deputy</FONT></I> is usually a person who acts under powers granted by a superior. The Prime Minister’s <I><FONT color=brown>deputy</FONT></I> has powers conferred by Parliament.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Associate">ASSOCIATE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all pertain to what is extremely ugly, deformed or shocking, or to anything that deserves to be hated or causes aversion or nausea. <B><FONT color=blue>Repulsive</FONT></B> can refer to visual appearance that is hideous or to behaviour that is worthy of condemnation because of its crudity or immorality: a <I><FONT color=brown>repulsive</FONT></I> painting; such <I><FONT color=brown>repulsive</FONT></I> habits as belching and picking his nose. <B><FONT color=blue>Repellent</FONT></B> can refer literally to the warding off of something: an insect-<I><FONT color=brown>repellent</FONT></I> spray. But otherwise it is an intensification of the possibilities for <I><FONT color=brown>repulsive</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>repellent</FONT></I> cruelty with which he treated his dog. Both words strongly imply a shocked or outraged reaction to the thing described, even to suggesting a physical drawing away from the object or a desire to drive it away: No matter how she tried to conquer her distaste, she found his disfigured body too <I><FONT color=brown>repulsive</FONT></I> to touch; using his cane in an attempt to smash the art object that he found so repellent.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abhorrent</FONT></B> derives ultimately from a Latin expression that refers to a horrified bristling, shuddering or shivering action. A comparable distaste, almost physical in its intensity, may well be indicated by the word, although now it applies less to visual appearance than to something that affronts one’s sensibilities or moral sense: the <I><FONT color=brown>abhorrent</FONT></I> policy of apartheid. In the context of moral indignation, <I><FONT color=brown>abhorrent</FONT></I> is the most forceful word here. <B><FONT color=blue>Loathsome</FONT></B> is closely related to such a use of <I><FONT color=brown>abhorrent</FONT></I>, but, whereas the latter might apply best as a sweeping condemnation of group action or behaviour, <I><FONT color=brown>loathsome</FONT></I> applies equally well to single acts or individuals: his <I><FONT color=brown>loathsome</FONT></I> mistreatment of his wife. In reference to group action, <I><FONT color=brown>loathsome</FONT></I> is less emphatic because the word may more clearly imply a personal aversion or disapproval that is not necessarily shared by others: <I><FONT color=brown>loathsome</FONT></I> customs that the newcomer found impossible to accept.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disgusting</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>revolting</FONT></B> are more like the first pair in suggesting a shocked or outraged reaction that can sometimes find physical expression. <I><FONT color=brown>Disgusting</FONT></I> can suggest an actual queasiness stimulated by something objectionable, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>revolting</FONT></I> can imply physical nausea or a psyche that reacts in rebellious upheaval to such a phenomenon: He found her cooking habits to be unhygienic and <I><FONT color=brown>disguising</FONT></I>; impossible to be polite when confronted with his <I><FONT color=brown>revolting</FONT></I> impertinence. Both words lose any suggestion of these intense reactions when applied more generally, especially when used as loose hyperboles for irritation or annoyance: <I><FONT color=brown>disgusting</FONT></I> incompetence. <I><FONT color=brown>Revolting</FONT></I>, in fact, can give a tone of extreme informality when used in this way: a <I><FONT color=brown>revolting</FONT></I> development.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Repugnant</FONT></B> also emphasizes a reaction of distaste or aversion, but is more formal than the previous pair. Also, because the word is less often used in loose exaggeration, it is considerably more forceful in effect: <I><FONT color=brown>repugnant</FONT></I> conditions in the restaurant kitchen that led to the proprietor’s being heavily fined; a <I><FONT color=brown>repugnant</FONT></I> indifference to human suffering. It is less forceful than abhorrent; to speak of <I><FONT color=brown>repugnant</FONT></I>, rather than <I><FONT color=brown>abhorrent</FONT></I>, crimes against humanity would show a want of feeling, since <I><FONT color=brown>abhorrent</FONT></I> expresses not only distaste but moral outrage as well.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abominable</FONT></B> is closer in tone to <I><FONT color=brown>abhorrent</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>loathsome</FONT></I> in stressing that something merits severe condemnation and hatred: <I><FONT color=brown>abominable</FONT></I> working conditions. This word has suffered from over-use and exaggeration to a greater degree than these other words, applying to anything that is relatively unpleasant: an <I><FONT color=brown>abominable</FONT></I> weekend of rain. Also, the word has been popularized as part of the phrase, "<I><FONT color=brown>abominable</FONT></I> snowman," referring to a legendary or imaginary man-beast reputed to exist in the mountains of Tibet; widespread humorous references to and extensions of this phrase have nearly incapacitated <I><FONT color=brown>abominable</FONT></I> itself for any serious use.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Contemptible">CONTEMPTIBLE</A>, <A href="entry://Depraved">DEPRAVED</A>, <A href="entry://Obnoxious">OBNOXIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Reprehensible">REPREHENSIBLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: admirable, alluring, amiable, <A href="entry://Charming">CHARMING</A>, commendable, <A href="entry://Excellent">EXCELLENT</A>, <A href="entry://Pleasing">PLEASING</A>, splendid.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in their denotation of a feeling of displeasure directed at the cause of some real or imagined wrong or injury. <B><FONT color=blue>Resentment</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>offence</FONT></B> are the terms referring to the strongest emotions characterized by this group. <I><FONT color=brown>Resentment</FONT></I> describes a sense of grievance which is internal and suggests a persistent or recurrent brooding over injuries rather than a sudden outburst of passionate anger. <I><FONT color=brown>Offence</FONT></I> designates a state of hurt feelings less extreme than <I><FONT color=brown>resentment</FONT></I> and without the strong sense of grievance implicit in that word. These is also in <I><FONT color=brown>offence</FONT></I> no suggestion of a long-felt emotion but rather one that is transitory because less serious. [She cherished a deep <I><FONT color=brown>resentment</FONT></I> towards her employer for having denied her a promotion; reporters and photographers alike took great <I><FONT color=brown>offence</FONT></I> at the rude way the star behaved during his interview.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pique</FONT></B>, which comes from a French word meaning to prick or sting, denotes a sudden feeling of mingled pain and anger that is usually slight and transient. <I><FONT color=brown>Pique</FONT></I> often arises from wounded vanity or sensitivity: leaving the party in a <I><FONT color=brown>pique</FONT></I> because of an imagined slight on the part of her hostess. <B><FONT color=blue>Umbrage</FONT></B> is a deeper and more persistent displeasure at being ignored or overshadowed or subjected to any treatment that one deems discourteous or disrespectful: to take <I><FONT color=brown>umbrage</FONT></I> at the criticism levelled against him because he thought it unfair and belittling. <B><FONT color=blue>Huff</FONT></B> is very much like <I><FONT color=brown>pique</FONT></I> in suggesting a petty, usually passing, sense of injury because of a blow to one’s pride: in a <I><FONT color=brown>huff</FONT></I> because his boss had upbraided him in front of his secretary.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anger">ANGER</A>, <A href="entry://Bother">BOTHER</A>, <A href="entry://Enrage">ENRAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Unsettle">UNSETTLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Patience">PATIENCE</A>, <A href="entry://Pleasure">PLEASURE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to an admiring attitude or to courteous treatment. <B><FONT color=blue>Respect</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>honour</FONT></B> can allude to both these possibilities. When describing an attitude, the words suggest an almost awed admiration for a person’s views, accomplishments, or behaviour; the person so admired is often one’s superior: feeling a sincere <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I> for the old woman because she successfully met all the challenges of a very difficult life; astounded to learn that a man who had been held in such high <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> had been dismissed from the department because of his political views. <I><FONT color=brown>Respect</FONT></I>, in a way that <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> does not, can refer to a feeling for one’s equal: a real <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I> for his opponent’s intelligence. When the words refer to a manner of treatment, they suggest a courteous, sometimes humble approach: paying the old dowager every conceivable <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I>; doing <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> to one’s parents.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Regard</FONT></B> is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> in that it can refer either to attitude or treatment. The attitude suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I> is a warmer but less awed feeling, suggesting approving friendliness more than humble admiration. It may sometimes suggest the attitude of a superior towards a favourite: happy to have won his employer’s <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I>. In any case, it is less austere than <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I>: classmates who held him in evident <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I>. When it applies to treatment, <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I> contrasts with the two preceding words by referring to a thoughtful or attentive concern rather than humble courtesy: giving the matter my special <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I>; treating the reporters interviewing him with unusual <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Esteem</FONT></B> alludes only to an attitude, designating a favourable opinion of a person which is based on worth but which is joined with a feeling of warm interest in, and sometimes attraction towards, the <I><FONT color=brown>esteemed</FONT></I> person: hurt by the indifference of a co-worker whom she had held in high <I><FONT color=brown>esteem</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Reverence</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>veneration</FONT></B> are alike in suggesting a deep, profound <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I> for someone or something. <I><FONT color=brown>Reverence</FONT></I> implies that feelings of love are mingled with <I><FONT color=brown>honour</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I>; it can refer to an attitude or treatment, the object of which is looked on as exalted or inviolable: <I><FONT color=brown>regarding</FONT></I> his grandfather almost with <I><FONT color=brown>reverence</FONT></I>; to have <I><FONT color=brown>reverence</FONT></I> for the Crown; treating a valuable piece of art with the <I><FONT color=brown>reverence</FONT></I> it deserves. <I><FONT color=brown>Veneration</FONT></I> refers more to attitude than treatment and implies <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I> mixed with awe, as for that which we consider to be not only of great worth but almost hallowed: <I><FONT color=brown>veneration</FONT></I> for a dead hero; <I><FONT color=brown>veneration</FONT></I> for the cause of freedom.</P><P>The remaining terms almost exclusively relate to treatment. <B><FONT color=blue>Deference</FONT></B> is restricted to possibilities of <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I> in this use. The word suggests an even greater formalized courtesy and may imply nothing about the true feelings of the person showing such <I><FONT color=brown>deference</FONT></I>: a briefing on what signs of <I><FONT color=brown>deference</FONT></I> the visiting head of state would expect. <B><FONT color=blue>Consideration</FONT></B>, by contrast, relates almost solely to possibilities of <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I> in this use. Here, even greater overtones of warmth are present, with thoughtfulness and concern more clearly motivated by sincere feeling: showing an unbiased <I><FONT color=brown>consideration</FONT></I> for both sides in the dispute. As with <I><FONT color=brown>respect</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>regard</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>deference</FONT></I> might be more appropriate for suggesting behaviour towards a superior, <I><FONT color=brown>consideration</FONT></I> for an inferior: parents who demand to be treated with <I><FONT color=brown>deference</FONT></I> by their children, yet give very little <I><FONT color=brown>consideration</FONT></I> in return.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>, <A href="entry://Revere">REVERE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: contempt, <A href="entry://Dislike">DISLIKE</A>, disrespect, repugnance.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>responsible</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>accountable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>answerable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>liable</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the agreement by which one takes on the blame or credit for the results of an endeavour over which one has charge. <B><FONT color=blue>Responsible</FONT></B> is the most general of these words, suggesting not only such as agreement but applying beyond this to anyone who is mature or able enough to discharge difficult or exacting duties, to delegate authority wisely, and to perform capably despite unforeseen obstacles. More strictly it suggests the relationship between the performer of duties and his taskmaster: <I><FONT color=brown>responsible</FONT></I> to the people alone as to the adequate performance of his duties. It may also refer exclusively to the assignment of blame in a negative situation: a jury pondering over whom to hold <I><FONT color=brown>responsible</FONT></I> for the accident. Much more restricted in scope than <I><FONT color=brown>responsible</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>liable</FONT></B> refers exclusively to this last possibility of assigning blame; in a legal sense it can even refer, most strictly, to the payment of monetary damages in a mishap: laws that hold the driver <I><FONT color=brown>liable</FONT></I> for any injury to those riding with him.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Accountable</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>liable</FONT></I>, has a legal or technical sense, but in this case the word refers to the situation of stewardship in which the steward must demonstrate the wise use of things put in his trust: a departmental manager who is directly <I><FONT color=brown>accountable</FONT></I> to the directors for the funds allocated to his department. <I><FONT color=brown>Answerable</FONT></I> has a less technical ring to it than parents were to be held <I><FONT color=brown>answerable</FONT></I> for the widespread discontent of teenagers; evolutionary changes that are <I><FONT color=brown>answerable</FONT></I> to corresponding changes in the earth’s environment at the time of a species?emergence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Obligation">OBLIGATION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: irresponsible, unaccountable.</P>

<P>These words all denote places where refreshments or meals are provided for the public. The most widely used term in the group, and the one with the widest range of meaning, is restaurant. A <B><FONT color=blue>restaurant</FONT></B> can be anything from a small counter operation to a very large establishment with several rooms. <I><FONT color=brown>Restaurants</FONT></I> can serve a variety of food or they can specialize in French, Italian, Chinese, Indian, Mexican, etc., cuisine. Many <I><FONT color=brown>restaurants</FONT></I> have bars or cocktail lounges where it is possible to have a drink before dining. At some <I><FONT color=brown>restaurants</FONT></I>, live music is played by, perhaps, a pianist or a small combination of instruments; indeed, there are <I><FONT color=brown>restaurants</FONT></I>, particularly foreign ones, where singers entertain during dinner hours and later on at night. <I><FONT color=brown>Restaurants</FONT></I> may be open for a relatively short time each day; some serve only breakfast and lunch ?others serve lunch and dinner; some serve dinner only, and still others are open for dinner, supper and late evening snacks. <B><FONT color=blue>Coffee shops</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>lunch-counters</FONT></B> (or <B><FONT color=blue>snack bars</FONT></B>) are small <I><FONT color=brown>restaurants</FONT></I> which cater to a breakfast, lunch or after theatre trade. They are quick-service eating places with people seated at counters as well as at tables. When a <I><FONT color=brown>coffee-shop</FONT></I> is part of a hotel, the name is used to distinguish it from the more formal and more expensive hotel restaurant called the hotel <B><FONT color=blue>dining-room</FONT></B>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Café</FONT></B> is the French word for <B><FONT color=blue>coffee-house</FONT></B>. Café can retain that meaning and be a small place which serves coffee and other non-alcoholic beverages and simple food such as pastry or sandwiches. More commonly, such an establishment is called a <I><FONT color=brown>coffee-shop</FONT></I>, and occasionally features, in addition to the same kind of refreshments, some kind of entertainment such as poetry readings or folk singing. <I><FONT color=brown>Café</FONT></I> can also designate, as it often does in Europe, an open-air eating and drinking place. In this kind of <I><FONT color=brown>café</FONT></I> it is sometimes possible to get alcoholic as well as non-alcoholic beverage and, if the <I><FONT color=brown>café</FONT></I> is part of a regular <I><FONT color=brown>restaurant</FONT></I>, a full meal.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>cafeteria</FONT></B> is a particular kind of <I><FONT color=brown>restaurant</FONT></I>, the distinctive feature of which is the fact that its patrons carry their own food from the counter, where it is served, to the table at which it is eaten. <I><FONT color=brown>Cafeterias</FONT></I> may be open for part of the day or all day.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Eating-house</FONT></B> is an informal word for any kind of <I><FONT color=brown>restaurant</FONT></I>. It is sometimes used as part of the name of an eating spot: Mother Hubbard’s <I><FONT color=brown>Eating-House</FONT></I>. It more often appears in the writing of advertisers or columnists who may or may not be intentionally trying to match the informality inherent in the word. [Melbourne’s newest celebrity hang-out is a posh <I><FONT color=brown>eating-house</FONT></I> in Collins Street.] <B><FONT color=blue>Greasy spoon</FONT></B> is slang. It graphically describes a <I><FONT color=brown>restaurant</FONT></I> whose food is cheap but no bargain and which is often as unsavoury-looking as the name suggests.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bar">BAR</A>.</P>

<P>These words all relate to entering into or being in the state called sleep. The most formal term in the group is <B><FONT color=blue>retire</FONT></B>. It can mean simply to go to bed: We <I><FONT color=brown>retired</FONT></I> early that night because the day’s activities had been so strenuous. It can and often does suggest a withdrawal to a private place where one can be alone, read, write, etc., before actually going to bed: We went to see Wilson after dinner, but his housekeeper informed us that he had <I><FONT color=brown>retired</FONT></I> for the evening. <B><FONT color=blue>Fall asleep</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>go to sleep</FONT></B> are the most common terms in the group. The first stresses the natural, passive suspension of consciousness that occurs when one ceases being awake: I <I><FONT color=brown>fell asleep</FONT></I> as soon as my head hit the pillow. The second can mean the same thing: to <I><FONT color=brown>go to sleep</FONT></I> quickly. But it can also suggest the deliberate action involved in going to bed before <I><FONT color=brown>falling asleep</FONT></I>: Let’s <I><FONT color=brown>go to sleep</FONT></I> now and clean up this mess in the morning.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Turn in</FONT></B> is a colloquial equivalent for <I><FONT color=brown>go to sleep</FONT></I> in the sense which implies the action of going to bed: We <I><FONT color=brown>turned in</FONT></I> at ten and slept for twelve hours straight. It can also suggest the same kind of withdrawing that <I><FONT color=brown>retire</FONT></I> does: I <I><FONT color=brown>turned in</FONT></I> right after dinner so as to get back to the detective story I’d started the night before.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hit the hay</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>hit the sack</FONT></B> are both slang expressions meaning to go to bed. <I><FONT color=brown>Hit the snack</FONT></I> was widely used in the armed services during World War II, but is now known in civilian as well as in military life. <B><FONT color=blue>Flake out</FONT></B>, believed to have stemmed from the nautical term to flake out a rope on the deck, is slang for go to bed, but it can mean <I><FONT color=brown>fall asleep</FONT></I> and even can suggest sleeping for a long time or at least for as long as one wishes: It’s going to be great to <I><FONT color=brown>flake out</FONT></I> tonight after a whole day on mess duty. <I><FONT color=brown>Flak out</FONT></I> has also developed the sense of passing out as a result of having had too much to drink: Joe <I><FONT color=brown>flaked out</FONT></I> early in the piece, and didn’t come good until the party was almost over.</P><P>The slang expression <B><FONT color=blue>grab some shut-eye</FONT></B> means to sleep. It can be used to refer to an ordinary night’s rest or to even a longer than normal period. But it often indicates a short sleep or nap: I’m going to <I><FONT color=brown>grab some shut-eye</FONT></I> before the party begins.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Leave">LEAVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the warm respect and honour with which one may regard an admirable person or institution. <B><FONT color=blue>Revere</FONT></B> is less formal and warmer in tone than <B><FONT color=blue>reverence</FONT></B>, which emphasizes solemnity. It is more appropriate for an institution or idea than a person, and it perhaps excessively formal in some cases: a master who still <I><FONT color=brown>reveres</FONT></I> his old teacher; the underprivileged who are asked to <I><FONT color=brown>reverence</FONT></I> the goals of a free society.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Worship</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>venerate</FONT></B> both, of course, function directly in a religious context; in this case, <I><FONT color=brown>worship</FONT></I> might be reserved for expressing one’s attitude to the divinity, while <I><FONT color=brown>venerate</FONT></I> could apply to an exemplary religious person, idea or aspect: <I><FONT color=brown>worshipping</FONT></I> God and <I><FONT color=brown>venerating</FONT></I> the saints. More broadly, in other contexts, <I><FONT color=brown>venerate</FONT></I> is often used in conjunction with the notions of dignity and advanced age: <I><FONT color=brown>venerating</FONT></I> the old man for the wisdom and courage he had shown throughout his long career. <I><FONT color=brown>Worship</FONT></I> can be used more generally: a father who simply <I><FONT color=brown>worships</FONT></I> his children. Sometimes it may suggest an excess and uncritical respect: people who <I><FONT color=brown>worshipped</FONT></I> Chairman Mao as though he were some sort of demigod.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Adore</FONT></B> suggests the most tenderness and warmth of any of these words, and, while it has a religious use, it functions in other contexts with fewer religious overtones than its synonyms: <I><FONT color=brown>adoring</FONT></I> the name of God; boys who <I><FONT color=brown>adore</FONT></I> their mothers. The word suggests the situation of love at a distance or the putting of someone on a pedestal more than it does a realistic, equal sharing of affection. <B><FONT color=blue>Idolize</FONT></B> is an extreme example of the overtones inherent in <I><FONT color=brown>adore</FONT></I>. While its pejorative possibilities should be clear in suggesting a slavish, servile, helpless love, the word is surprisingly enough often used with no negative intent whatsoever: men who <I><FONT color=brown>idolize</FONT></I> rather than attempt to satisfy their wives: a writer who simply <I><FONT color=brown>idolized</FONT></I> the novels of Dostoevski.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Love">LOVE</A>, <A href="entry://Respect">RESPECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: blaspheme, contemn, <A href="entry://Despise">DESPISE</A>, <A href="entry://Reject">REJECT</A>, <A href="entry://Scoff">SCOFF</A>, <A href="entry://Slight">SLIGHT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to changes in an existing system, especially a written one, usually with a view to its betterment. <B><FONT color=blue>Revise</FONT></B> suggests large or small alterations, mostly in a piece of writing, in order to bring it up to date, or to make it sounder or more in keeping with a given intention: <I><FONT color=brown>revising</FONT></I> the whole book to make it more compact and give it a tauter, more dramatic forward movement; ideologies that are constantly <I><FONT color=brown>revised</FONT></I> in the light of changing circumstances; <I><FONT color=brown>revising</FONT></I> the earlier edition of his textbook. <B><FONT color=blue>Rewrite</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests a more thoroughgoing change and is more exclusively restricted in use to refer to manuscripts or documents. While it may be used in reference to a single sentence or to an entire book, major alterations in structure or theme rather than in style or expression are most often indicated: arguing that the resolution before the United Nations General Assembly, to give New Guinea independence, be <I><FONT color=brown>rewritten</FONT></I>; the film star who insisted that her part be completely <I><FONT color=brown>rewritten</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>rewriting</FONT></I> the conclusion of the novel in such a way as to change the them and outcome of the whole book.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Amend</FONT></B> indicates the change in a document by adding on new sections at the end: <I><FONT color=brown>amending</FONT></I> the Constitution so that it gave specific rules on state rights. While <I><FONT color=brown>amend</FONT></I>, thus, would seem to suggest less possibility for change than previous words, a document can in actual theory he <I><FONT color=brown>amended</FONT></I> so that all its provisions are nullified and replaced by complete opposite or different provision. <B><FONT color=blue>Emend</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests a textual change, small in extent, that is accomplished in the body of the work itself, usually by someone other than the original author: scholars who <I><FONT color=brown>emend</FONT></I> Shakespeare freely when they decide that the existing texts are garbled or unsound; lazy minds that wrench a great writer’s words out of context and then further <I><FONT color=brown>emend</FONT></I> them to suit their own taste.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Insert">INSERT</A>, <A href="entry://Repair">REPAIR</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the act of holding something up for disapproval or contempt. <B><FONT color=blue>Ridicule</FONT></B> suggests a conscious and usually verbal attack on something so that it will be regarded as ludicrous: heaping <I><FONT color=brown>ridicule</FONT></I> on her desire to keep her job after they were married. <B><FONT color=blue>Derision</FONT></B> suggests a fiercer attack, one designed not only to prove something ludicrous, but contemptible as well; the word is often used in the context of a public display of such contempt: casting <I><FONT color=brown>derision</FONT></I> on the whole tax system; audiences who greeted her efforts at singing with catcalls and <I><FONT color=brown>derision</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Mockery</FONT></B> may suggest a lighter, more subtle approach than <I><FONT color=brown>ridicule</FONT></I>, but it is characterized by the same motivating contempt as <I><FONT color=brown>derision</FONT></I>: stung by the note of <I><FONT color=brown>mockery</FONT></I> in his remarks. <I><FONT color=brown>Mockery</FONT></I> is often used in a special way for an act that leaves a person open to intense disapproval: making a <I><FONT color=brown>mockery</FONT></I> of the whole democratic process. <I><FONT color=brown>Mockery</FONT></I> can also mean impudent mimicry which is another way of expressing contempt: His <I><FONT color=brown>mockery</FONT></I> of her walk was little appreciated by others in the room.</P><P>The remaining three words relate more closely to the techniques for making something seem ludicrous or contemptible. <B><FONT color=blue>Irony</FONT></B> is the technique of saying the opposite of the meaning intended to be conveyed: his deliberate <I><FONT color=brown>irony</FONT></I> in referring to the bejewelled matrons as generous and compassionate. <B><FONT color=blue>Satire</FONT></B> suggests a less subtle assault through such techniques as overstatement, ridicule, or laughter-provoking <I><FONT color=brown>derision</FONT></I>. Unsettling many officials with his pointed <I><FONT color=brown>satire</FONT></I> on their bungling methods of coping with the crisis. <I><FONT color=brown>Satire</FONT></I> may also refer to any work using <I><FONT color=brown>ridicule</FONT></I>: Pope’s <I><FONT color=brown>satire</FONT></I> on the bad writers of his day. <B><FONT color=blue>Sarcasm</FONT></B> is most often restricted to the making of brief, unpleasant remarks that are motivated by hostility and contempt: replying with <I><FONT color=brown>sarcasm</FONT></I> to anything she tried to suggest as a solution to their difficulties.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Caricature">CARICATURE</A>, <A href="entry://Humorous">HUMOROUS</A>, oke.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to anything that is fitting, proper or called for by legal or ethical standards. <B><FONT color=blue>Rightful</FONT></B> suggests that something is in accordance with some objective set of standards: a <I><FONT color=brown>rightful</FONT></I> heir to the property; the <I><FONT color=brown>rightful</FONT></I> place of women in society. The word is often used when something thought true or fitting has been challenged: protesting that he was still their <I><FONT color=brown>rightful</FONT></I> monarch. <B><FONT color=blue>Just</FONT></B> also emphasizes an objective set of standards by which to judge whether something is fitting, but here the standards, by implication, are legal or moral ones; a <I><FONT color=brown>just</FONT></I> trial; arguing that a <I><FONT color=brown>just</FONT></I> society could not tolerate segregation of any kind.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Due</FONT></B> emphasizes appropriateness or reasonableness: promising to answer in <I><FONT color=brown>due</FONT></I> course; a <I><FONT color=brown>due</FONT></I> punishment. In emphasizing moderation and practicality, the word can sometimes seem a denial that objective standards exist and thus imply an arbitrary judgement: asserting that there was no conflict between the censorship law and a <I><FONT color=brown>due</FONT></I> regard for civil liberties. The word can also imply something that has accrued with item or has been left outstanding: public apathy that permits criminals to escape their <I><FONT color=brown>due</FONT></I> punishment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deserved</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>merited</FONT></B> both emphasize the earning of something: a <I><FONT color=brown>deserved</FONT></I> honour; a <I><FONT color=brown>deserved</FONT></I> punishment; a <I><FONT color=brown>merited</FONT></I> award. As shown in these examples, <I><FONT color=brown>deserved</FONT></I> can be used both positively and negatively, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>merited</FONT></I> is more often used only for positive achievements. <B><FONT color=blue>Well-earned</FONT></B> is almost synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>merited</FONT></I> but has greater informality and, if anything, less stress on the actual value of the contribution made: a <I><FONT color=brown>well-earned</FONT></I> rest. <B><FONT color=blue>Fair</FONT></B> is the mildest and most general of these words; it is also the most subjective in suggesting an appeal to reasonableness and open-mindedness: a referee who was scrupulously <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I> in all his decisions; claiming that it wasn’t <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I> that he had to do more work than his brother. <B><FONT color=blue>Equitable</FONT></B>, more formal than <I><FONT color=brown>fair</FONT></I>, suggests a solution that is <I><FONT color=brown>just</FONT></I> and reasonable to all parties concerned, but not necessarily wholly satisfactory to all. It is often used in contexts indicating an acceptable compromise rather than those susceptible to sharp distinctions between right and wrong: The wage agreement was <I><FONT color=brown>equitable</FONT></I> to both management and unions, although both had misgivings about certain aspects of the settlement.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lawful">LAWFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>, <A href="entry://Right">RIGHT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: evil, illicit, improper, <A href="entry://Outrageous">OUTRAGEOUS</A>, unlawful, wrongful.</P>

<P>These words refer to those whose ideologies justify the existence of considerable degrees of inequality in society. The justification given may be either direct or indirect. An extreme <B><FONT color=blue>right-winger</FONT></B>, such as a <B><FONT color=blue>fascist</FONT></B>, directly justifies inequality: The <I><FONT color=brown>fascist</FONT></I> society was ruled by an elite of supposedly superior endowments. The word <I><FONT color=brown>fascist</FONT></I> also frequently suggests theories that one racial or ethnic group is superior to others, as in the form of fascism practised by the <B><FONT color=blue>Nazis</FONT></B> of Hitler Germany and by those who are endeavouring to keep alive the spirit of <I><FONT color=brown>Nazism</FONT></I> in various countries today.</P><P>For many <B><FONT color=blue>conservatives</FONT></B>, the justification for inequality may be indirect. In its political context, the word <I><FONT color=brown>conservative</FONT></I> suggests a person who views society as a slowly developing, and often fragile, organism which may be seriously damaged by attempts to bring about sweeping changes through political action. Because considerable inequalities exist in most known societies, a <I><FONT color=brown>conservative</FONT></I> thus indirectly favours inequality because his is suspicious of radical attempts to abolish it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tory</FONT></B> has been used as a generic term for any <I><FONT color=brown>conservative</FONT></I>, especially one who is a proponent or beneficiary of privilege, status or an entrenched establishment. The word has never had much currency in Australia and New Zealand, although it is the popular name for the Conservative Party in Britain.</P><P>In a wider context, the word <I><FONT color=brown>conservative</FONT></I> suggests a rejection of modern or contemporary styles or tastes: political liberals who are <I><FONT color=brown>conservatives</FONT></I> when it comes to their taste in art and music. <B><FONT color=blue>Traditionalist</FONT></B> is more appropriate in this wider context than conservative, since it cannot be confused as a reference to politics; it suggests a person who judges things in the light of clearly defined standards evolved over a long period of time; <I><FONT color=brown>traditionalists</FONT></I> whose paintings showed no influence of the current avant-garde ferment.</P><P>In Australia, where there is much popular sentiment in favour of progress, <B><FONT color=blue>reactionary</FONT></B> is an extremely pejorative term, for it suggests a person who wishes to wipe out the political innovations of a previous period by returning to an older, more rigid governmental scheme: <I><FONT color=brown>reactionaries</FONT></I> who propose the abolition of the system of social services. Although <I><FONT color=brown>reactionaries</FONT></I> are often to be found in <I><FONT color=brown>conservative</FONT></I> parties, they are more radical than <I><FONT color=brown>conservatives</FONT></I>, since any attempt to turn back the clock in politics entails sweeping changes to an existing society.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: OLD-FASHIONED.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: LEFT-WINGER, whig.</P>

<P>These words refer to the prescribed way of conducting a formal event of significance. <B><FONT color=blue>Rite</FONT></B> now pertains mostly to a religious service, referring to the whole service as an entity: The Anglican <I><FONT color=brown>rite</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>rites</FONT></I> of puberty in primitive societies. <B><FONT color=blue>Ritual</FONT></B> includes but goes beyond this meaning by referring to the formal manner of conducting a tire: Puritans who objected to the emphasis on <I><FONT color=brown>ritual</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Ritual</FONT></I> has become popular to describe any action conducted with great formality, seriousness or inflexibility: the opening-night <I><FONT color=brown>ritual</FONT></I> of waiting up for the drama critics?reviews; the mysterious <I><FONT color=brown>rituals</FONT></I> women undergo in beauty parlours; her little <I><FONT color=brown>ritual</FONT></I> of agreeing with everything he said.

<B><FONT color=blue>rob</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>embezzle</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>extort</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>milk</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the taking of something from someone against his will. <B><FONT color=blue>Rob</FONT></B> is the most general of these, referring to any such situation; it often suggests an isolated act involving a fairly direct use of force, as in house-breaking, or the threat of force, as in an armed confrontation; the couple whose house was <I><FONT color=brown>robbed</FONT></I> while they were on holidays; <I><FONT color=brown>robbed</FONT></I> in a hold-up.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Extort</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>embezzle</FONT></B> are more formal; each has a particular area of relevance. <I><FONT color=brown>Extort</FONT></I> refers specifically to an official who compels someone to give him something not his by right, possibly in exchange for an improper favour: health inspectors who <I><FONT color=brown>extorted</FONT></I> bribes from landlords before declaring their buildings free of health hazards. Money need not always be involved: <I><FONT color=brown>extorting</FONT></I> party-line obedience from the councillors by threatening to reveal their part in the rake-off scandal. The word, thus, has a connotation that suggests any sort of shady, underhanded or unsavouray dealing, not necessarily by an official: mothers who <I><FONT color=brown>extort</FONT></I> allegiance from their children by a sort of emotional blackmail. In another related use, the word can serve as a humorous substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>rob</FONT></I>: he <I><FONT color=brown>extorted</FONT></I> my wallet from me at the point of a gun. <I><FONT color=brown>Embezzle</FONT></I> applies much more strictly to a single situation, that of covertly taking money from an employer by "juggling" the relevant financial records; usually, an accountant, treasurer, cashier or someone else entrusted with other people’s money is involved in this crime.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Milk</FONT></B> is slang for getting money or other benefits from someone by means of threats, flattery, persuasion or any sort of unethical means; it strongly suggests the tapping of a portion of some larger amount: stand-over men who <I><FONT color=brown>milked</FONT></I> protection money from every prostitute in Adelaide; using a tube to <I><FONT color=brown>milk</FONT></I> petrol from parked cars. The word can also refer to small amounts acquired with difficulty: <I><FONT color=brown>milking</FONT></I> his friends for free meals and drinks. Thus, at one extreme, the word can be a slangy substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>extort</FONT></I>, where outright illegality is involved, and, at the other, can indicate the mere act of freeloading, which may be annoying or unethical but certainly not illegal.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheat">CHEAT</A>, <A href="entry://Steal">STEAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the taking of someone else’s possessions against his will. <B><FONT color=blue>Robbery</FONT></B> most often suggests a face-to-face confrontation between robber and victim in which the victim surrenders his valuable bakes of threat or violence. In common understanding, <B><FONT color=blue>thuggry</FONT></B>, sometimes known under its American name of <B><FONT color=blue>mugging</FONT></B>, is a <I><FONT color=brown>robbery</FONT></I> that occurs with an actual carrying out of violence, so that the victim is rendered helpless or unconscious and then divested of his valuables. <B><FONT color=blue>Burglary</FONT></B>, by contrast, refers to a person’s breaking and entering any dwelling house by night with intent to steal ?whether or not such intent is actually carried out. <B><FONT color=blue>Hold-up</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stick-up</FONT></B> approach slang in their informality; <I><FONT color=brown>stick-up</FONT></I> can functions as an informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>robbery</FONT></I>, but like <I><FONT color=brown>hold-up</FONT></I> it can refer also to the robbing of premises, such as a bank, when a group of people is confronted and cowed. <I><FONT color=brown>Hold-up</FONT></I> refers to detention by force with a view to <I><FONT color=brown>robbery</FONT></I>, and thus is closer to <I><FONT color=brown>burglary</FONT></I> except for its necessary implication of an intended confrontation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Theft</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>larceny</FONT></B> are more general and abstract than these other words; <I><FONT color=brown>theft</FONT></I> can apply to any taking of property against the will of the owner, whether by stealth, confrontation or fraud. <I><FONT color=brown>Larceny</FONT></I> is the legal term for theft. Formerly under English law, if the value of stolen goods was no more than 12d. (10c), the <I><FONT color=brown>theft</FONT></I> was called petty <I><FONT color=brown>larceny</FONT></I> and a light sentence would apply upon conviction; if over, grand <I><FONT color=brown>larceny</FONT></I> had been committed, carrying a heavier sentence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheat">CHEAT</A>, <A href="entry://Steal">STEAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the breakdown of dead organic tissues by natural bacterial processes. <B><FONT color=blue>Rot</FONT></B> is the least formal and most forceful of these words, suggesting an advanced point in this process of breakdown; the tissues at his point might or might not be foul-smelling but they would in any case be almost unrecognizable, compared to their former state: a fear of plague that had left dead bodies to <I><FONT color=brown>rot</FONT></I> in the streets; a snail that had completely <I><FONT color=brown>rotted</FONT></I> away inside its shell: leather bindings that had <I><FONT color=brown>rotted</FONT></I> to pieces in the damp basement; leaves left to <I><FONT color=brown>rot</FONT></I> in the compost heap. <B><FONT color=blue>Spoil</FONT></B>, by contrast, refers to an earlier point in the process of organic breakdown; it is especially applied to foods that have turned "bad" or begun to turn: milk that had <I><FONT color=brown>spoilt</FONT></I> out of the refrigerator; drying fruit in the sun so that it would not <I><FONT color=brown>spoil</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Decay</FONT></B> is a more matter-of-fact word than <I><FONT color=brown>rot</FONT></I>, and applies generally to the whole process of breakdown, but particularly to the end point of total destruction: a corpse that had already <I><FONT color=brown>decayed</FONT></I>, leaving only the skeleton intact; washed-up seaweed that lay <I><FONT color=brown>decaying</FONT></I> on the beach. <B><FONT color=blue>Decompose</FONT></B> is a more formal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>decay</FONT></I>, but is almost clinical in its particular reference to a stage in the process between <I><FONT color=brown>spoil</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>rot</FONT></I> where tissues may be distended and ruptured by a build-up of gases: formaldehyde to prevent the specimens from <I><FONT color=brown>decomposing</FONT></I>; treatment plants to <I><FONT color=brown>decompose</FONT></I> sewage more rapidly.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Putrefy</FONT></B> refers to the same point in the process as <I><FONT color=brown>decompose</FONT></I>, stressing particularly the presence of foul or poisonous gases and noxious odours: fish that had died and now lay <I><FONT color=brown>putrefying</FONT></I> in the shallows of the stream; garbage that <I><FONT color=brown>putrefied</FONT></I> in heaps on the neglected beach. <B><FONT color=blue>Moulder</FONT></B> might now be thought too precious or euphemistic a substitute for decay. It means to decay gradually and turn into dust: his remains <I><FONT color=brown>mouldering</FONT></I> in the tomb; old castles <I><FONT color=brown>mouldering</FONT></I> on the Rhine.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Corpse">CORPSE</A>, <A href="entry://Dead">DEAD</A>, <A href="entry://Die">DIE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bloom, <A href="entry://Flourish">FLOURISH</A>, grow.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>rotate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gyrate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>revolve</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>roll</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>spin</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>turn</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>twirl</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>whirl</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all mean to have or impart a circular motion. <B><FONT color=blue>Rotate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>revolve</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>roll</FONT></B> describe three different circular motions, though they are frequently used interchangeably. A body <I><FONT color=brown>rotates</FONT></I> round its own axis or centre. A body <I><FONT color=brown>revolves</FONT></I> round a centre outside itself: The earth <I><FONT color=brown>revolves</FONT></I> round the sun. A body <I><FONT color=brown>rolls</FONT></I> on a plane or other surface, with which its circumference is in continuous contact: A car wheel <I><FONT color=brown>rolls</FONT></I> on the ground, while it <I><FONT color=brown>rotates</FONT></I> on its axle.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gyrate</FONT></B> is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>revolve</FONT></I>. However, <I><FONT color=brown>gyrate</FONT></I> emphasizes spiral or helical movement about, or as if about, a central point or axis, while revolve indicates circular or elliptical movement: an eagle <I><FONT color=brown>gyrating</FONT></I> majestically up into the sky for a thousand feet before plunging down on his prey; the <I><FONT color=brown>gyrating</FONT></I>, violent winds of cyclone.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Turn</FONT></B> is the most general word of this group, and may be used as a synonym for any of the others. It most commonly applies to <I><FONT color=brown>rotary</FONT></I> motion, and is thus most often used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>rotate</FONT></I>: The earth turns on its axis. <I><FONT color=brown>Turn</FONT></I> is simply more colourless and less precise denotatively than the other words; it implies nothing about speed or the complexity or course of the circular movement in question.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Spin</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>twirl</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>whirl</FONT></B> all mean to turn or cause to turn rapidly and continuously. <I><FONT color=brown>Whirl</FONT></I> usually implies greater speed than the other two words, while <I><FONT color=brown>twirl</FONT></I> often refers to a complicated series of movements of something manipulated by the hands or fingers. <I><FONT color=brown>Spin</FONT></I> emphasizes the continuity of the action, and usually the narrow compass of the circular motion; it may, however, apply to any action of turning: The earth <I><FONT color=brown>spins</FONT></I> on its axis. [The wind <I><FONT color=brown>whirled</FONT></I> the leaves round the yard; a drum major <I><FONT color=brown>twirling</FONT></I> his baton; to <I><FONT color=brown>spin</FONT></I> a top.] <I><FONT color=brown>Spin</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>whirled</FONT></I> may also be used for any abrupt circular motion: The car <I><FONT color=brown>spun</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>whirled</FONT></I>) round out of control. <I><FONT color=brown>Whirl</FONT></I>, more often than <I><FONT color=brown>spin</FONT></I>, has the connotation of lack of conscious control or design: The sensations <I><FONT color=brown>whirled</FONT></I> through his mind too rapidly for him to assimilate them, much less understand his feelings.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bend">BEND</A>, <A href="entry://Circumscribe">CIRCUMSCRIBE</A>, <A href="entry://Go">GO</A>, <A href="entry://Move">MOVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things that are not smooth or straight. <B><FONT color=blue>Rough</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>uneven</FONT></B> are both very general and vague in their implications. <I><FONT color=brown>Rough</FONT></I> can specifically indicate a coarse-grained surface: <I><FONT color=brown>rough</FONT></I> sandpaper. At its most specific, <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> suggests something, such as a line, configuration or surface, that has more noticeable ups and downs: an <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> margin; <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> landscape. <I><FONT color=brown>Rough</FONT></I>, however, may also indicate irregular or <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> ground that is impenetrable, steep or difficult to traverse: <I><FONT color=brown>rough</FONT></I> terrain. Less concretely, the word can indicate anything unrefined, harsh or difficult: a <I><FONT color=brown>rough</FONT></I> sketch; <I><FONT color=brown>rough</FONT></I> treatment; <I><FONT color=brown>rough</FONT></I> wine; a <I><FONT color=brown>rough</FONT></I> job. The last use approaches slang in its informality. In its other uses, <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> stays closer to its reference to something with irregular variations: <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> patches of shrubbery scattered across the lawns; an amusing but <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> play. It can refer also to something unsymmetrical, unmatched or disarranged: a face with <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> features; The pictures on the walls were slightly <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> in placement.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bumpy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rugged</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>corrugated</FONT></B> are much more specific in their reference to <I><FONT color=brown>rough</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> surfaces. <I><FONT color=brown>Rugged</FONT></I> applied mostly to landscape, stressing an extremely <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> topography or a resistance to smooth passage: <I><FONT color=brown>rugged</FONT></I> mountains; <I><FONT color=brown>rugged</FONT></I> waves; a <I><FONT color=brown>rugged</FONT></I> dirt road. The word carries implications of harshness or toughness, as can be seen in more general uses of the word: a <I><FONT color=brown>rugged</FONT></I>, masculine build. <I><FONT color=brown>Bumpy</FONT></I> can refer to smaller-scale surfaces as well as to landscape. In both cases, the word may suggest a generally smooth stretch that is nevertheless filled with small hollows and lumpy projections: After an hour of sanding, the boards were still quite <I><FONT color=brown>bumpy</FONT></I>. Often, the word refers to anything that results in travel that is full of jolts: a <I><FONT color=brown>bumpy</FONT></I> road enclosed by <I><FONT color=brown>rugged</FONT></I> hills; Our jet picked its way through air pockets that made the flight extremely <I><FONT color=brown>bumpy</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Corrugated</FONT></I> refers to a more even series of bumps, sometimes by design, as with <I><FONT color=brown>corrugated</FONT></I> iron or asbestos for roofing. In another specific use it applies to a road surface in which regular small bumps have developed in a lateral direction, so that a car is badly shaken.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crooked</FONT></B> specifically refers to undesirable departures, great or small, from the horizontal or vertical. [All the pictures on the wall were <I><FONT color=brown>crooked</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>crooked</FONT></I> tower; The seams of her stockings were <I><FONT color=brown>crooked</FONT></I>.] In more general uses, the word can refer to anything skewed, much like <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>crooked</FONT></I> shelves. Occasionally, the word can be used with poetic force to describe something that is naturally uneven or rugged: a range of <I><FONT color=brown>crooked</FONT></I> mountains. <B><FONT color=blue>Jagged</FONT></B> can also be used in this way, particularly of steep or extremely uneven topography: the <I><FONT color=brown>jagged</FONT></I> lip of the crater. More specifically, the word refers to small-scale shapes with sharp or needle-like edges such as those that result when something brittle is broken or shattered: the <I><FONT color=brown>jagged</FONT></I> edges of the broken bone; <I><FONT color=brown>jagged</FONT></I> pieces of glass. As in the last example, the word can refer primarily to an <I><FONT color=brown>uneven</FONT></I> configuration rather than to <I><FONT color=brown>rough</FONT></I> surfaces.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Serrated</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>crenellated</FONT></B> are the most technical and specific of these words. <I><FONT color=brown>Serrated</FONT></I> refers to any saw-toothed configuration or edge: a <I><FONT color=brown>serrated</FONT></I> knife. <I><FONT color=brown>Crenellated</FONT></I> refers most specifically to the regular notched upper edge that is typical of battlements: <I><FONT color=brown>crenellated</FONT></I> castle walls. It can apply more widely to any edge with deep notches: leave distinguished by their <I><FONT color=brown>crenellated</FONT></I> edges.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Keen">KEEN</A>, <A href="entry://Mountain">MOUNTAIN</A>, <A href="entry://Steep">STEEP</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: even, fine, smooth, straight.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>sacred</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>blessed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>consecrated</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>divine</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hallowed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>holy</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to things that a particular religion holds to be dedicated to its god and worthy of adoration. <B><FONT color=blue>Sacred</FONT></B> suggests something associated with a divinity as being worthy of reverence: a temple <I><FONT color=brown>scared</FONT></I> to Apollo; a mountain thought to be <I><FONT color=brown>sacred</FONT></I> by Shintoists. In another use, the word can simply demarcate from everyday life a sphere of things belonging to a religion: the strict separation of <I><FONT color=brown>sacred</FONT></I> and secular laws: <I><FONT color=brown>sacred</FONT></I> and profane love. <B><FONT color=blue>Consecrated</FONT></B> may suggest, most specifically, that human beings have by a prescribed ritual recommended something to their divinity as being of special worth: the bishop who <I><FONT color=brown>consecrates</FONT></I> a king. One would, thus, say that the king was <I><FONT color=brown>consecrated</FONT></I> to his God, but not necessarily that he was <I><FONT color=brown>sacred</FONT></I> to his God. Reinforcing this distinction, consecrated can mean also a giving over or utter dedication to a deity or even to some other ideal: <I><FONT color=brown>consecrating</FONT></I> himself to the civil-rights struggle. <B><FONT color=blue>Divine</FONT></B> is more like <I><FONT color=brown>sacred</FONT></I> but goes even further in suggesting something that is of a deity or issues from him: holding that the Pentateuch was <I><FONT color=brown>divine</FONT></I> in origin. It can, like <I><FONT color=brown>sacred</FONT></I>, also distinguish the religious realm from more ordinary ones: St. Augustine’s effort to mediate between the <I><FONT color=brown>divine</FONT></I> and mundane worlds.</P><P>The remaining words, like <I><FONT color=brown>consecrated</FONT></I>, suggest something that has been made worthy of worship. Of these, only <I><FONT color=brown>blessed</FONT></I> (pronounced as two syllables) may suggest the official or ritual declaration such as <I><FONT color=brown>consecrated</FONT></I> may indicate. At its most specific, <I><FONT color=brown>blessed</FONT></I> [bles’id] is the title for a deceased person who has been beatified by the Roman Catholic Church in an appropriate ceremony. More generally, the word simply indicates something worthy of reverent adoration or something given significance by the particular act of a clergyman: the <I><FONT color=brown>blessed</FONT></I> [bles’id] Bible; a crucifix <I><FONT color=brown>blessed</FONT></I> [pronounced blest] by the Pope. <B><FONT color=blue>Hallowed</FONT></B> may suggest something that has been made an object of adoration or it may, less specifically, refer to something that is in actual fact revered: the <I><FONT color=brown>hallowed</FONT></I> saints; his wish to be buried in <I><FONT color=brown>hallowed</FONT></I> ground. <B><FONT color=blue>Holy</FONT></B> is the least specific of all these words, suggesting anything dedicated to God or anything righteous or godly: the <I><FONT color=brown>holy</FONT></I> church; the <I><FONT color=brown>holy</FONT></I> days of Lent; a <I><FONT color=brown>holy</FONT></I> man from Calcutta.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Revere">REVERE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: lay, temporal, <A href="entry://Worldly">WORLDLY</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>sad</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>blue</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>dejected</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>depressed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>despondent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>disconsolate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>downcast</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lugubrious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>melancholy</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are all used of unhappy or despairing states of mind and, in some cases, of situations which cause or are evocative of such feelings. <B><FONT color=blue>Sad</FONT></B>, the mildest and most general term, is also the least explicit, since it gives no hint as to how downcast a person may be or for what reason. One may feel <I><FONT color=brown>sad</FONT></I> because of the passing of summer, or <I><FONT color=brown>sad</FONT></I> because a child leaves home to be married. A funeral may be a <I><FONT color=brown>sad</FONT></I> occasion, but so may the cutting down of a beautiful forest for timber. A monkey peering out of a cage may have the <I><FONT color=brown>sad</FONT></I> eyes of a lonely old man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dejected</FONT></B> means literally cast down in spirits and, like <B><FONT color=blue>downcast</FONT></B> itself, suggests a temporary state of disappointment and discouragement brought on by some external event: <I><FONT color=brown>dejected</FONT></I> when she failed to win the prize; <I><FONT color=brown>downcast</FONT></I> because a friend failed to greet him in the street.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Depressed</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>despondent</FONT></B> both apply to more prolonged states of sadness. <I><FONT color=brown>Depressed</FONT></I> describes an emotional state in which both physical and mental activity may be slowed down, sometimes to the point of apathy. The <I><FONT color=brown>depressed</FONT></I> person is flooded with feeling of hopelessness and low self-esteem, and he tends to withdraw into himself and brood. To the casual observer, one who is <I><FONT color=brown>depressed</FONT></I> often appears to be so without apparent cause or, at most, for insufficient reasons. <I><FONT color=brown>Despondent</FONT></I> is sometimes used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>depressed</FONT></I>, although the former often connotes great grief and a feeling of helplessness because of some catastrophe: <I><FONT color=brown>despondent</FONT></I> because he lost all his money on the share market; <I><FONT color=brown>despondent</FONT></I> over the death of his wife; a patient <I><FONT color=brown>despondent</FONT></I> because his condition does not improve.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Melancholy</FONT></B> suggests a habitual pensiveness and sadness which may not necessarily be unpleasant, and it stresses the presence of sorrow rather than of pain. [During the Romantic period it was fashionable in literature to have a <I><FONT color=brown>melancholy</FONT></I> outlook on the world and to turn one’s back on liveliness and joy.] In the past, <I><FONT color=brown>melancholy</FONT></I> has been applied to persons suffering from the marked lowness of spirits associated with mental illness. It is rarely so used today, <I><FONT color=brown>depressed</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>despondent</FONT></I> having supplanted it in this sense. <I><FONT color=brown>Melancholy</FONT></I> may also describe things and places that have an adverse effect on one’s good spirits: the <I><FONT color=brown>melancholy</FONT></I> sound of the wind; the <I><FONT color=brown>melancholy</FONT></I> news of a friend’s bad luck; the <I><FONT color=brown>melancholy</FONT></I> beach, deserted and covered with dead seaweed and debris.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disconsolate</FONT></B> means refusing or unable to accept consolation or comfort, as after a loss or disappointment. <I><FONT color=brown>Disconsolate</FONT></I> is a more literary term than <I><FONT color=brown>despondent</FONT></I>, and it carries the suggestion of an outward expression of sorrow or pain rather than of listlessness: a <I><FONT color=brown>disconsolate</FONT></I> woman sobbing before the smoking ruins of her home.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lugubrious</FONT></B>, while actually meaning <I><FONT color=brown>sad</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>dejected</FONT></I>, is now applied almost exclusively to a person or thing that is so excessively mournful or solemn as to be ludicrous. [Our Sunday school teacher used to regale us with accounts of the <I><FONT color=brown>lugubrious</FONT></I> fates awaiting bad children; A bloodhound has long ears, pendulous chops and a <I><FONT color=brown>lugubrious</FONT></I> expression.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Blue</FONT></B> is a loose synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>sad</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>depressed</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>despondent</FONT></I>. It does not suggest the extent or depth of such a feeling except in context, and it tends to sound informal. [She was <I><FONT color=brown>blue</FONT></I> and lonely because she had no Saturday-night date; A retired person often becomes <I><FONT color=brown>blue</FONT></I> because he feels he is no longer engaged in meaningful activity.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Despair">DESPAIR</A>, <A href="entry://Gloomy">GLOOMY</A>, <A href="entry://Miserable">MISERABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Pathetic">PATHETIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Blithe">BLITHE</A>, <A href="entry://Cheerful">CHEERFUL</A>, excited, exhilarated, exuberant, gay, glad, <A href="entry://Joyous">JOYOUS</A>, jubilant, <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a specific thing or piece of data summoned up to represent or verify a general type or thesis. <B><FONT color=blue>Sample</FONT></B> usually indicates something that is physically present for inspection as a representative of some larger entity. [The interior decorator had brought along <I><FONT color=brown>samples</FONT></I> of the fabrics he had selected for the curtains and upholstery of the room; The enclosed essay is a <I><FONT color=brown>sample</FONT></I> of my writing.] Most concretely, <B><FONT color=blue>illustration</FONT></B> may indicate graphic material that accompanies a written text to supplement it or help explain it: a book on architecture with beautiful <I><FONT color=brown>illustrations</FONT></I>; an algebra textbook with numerous <I><FONT color=brown>illustrations</FONT></I>. But the word can refer to any citing of specific material to supplement, explain or demonstrate a thesis or train of thought: He threw in two humorous anecdotes as <I><FONT color=brown>illustrations</FONT></I> of his main point. The word can refer also to something that is merely alluded to rather than actually presented: She cited the slaughtering of Albigensians and Incas in <I><FONT color=brown>illustration</FONT></I> of her argument that previous attempts at genocide were not uncommon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Specimen</FONT></B> stresses even more than sample the physical presence of a representatively individual. The word is also clinical in tone, suggesting a laboratory or scientific context: microscopes set up with <I><FONT color=brown>specimens</FONT></I> of the four blood types; rock <I><FONT color=brown>specimens</FONT></I>; entomological display cases with <I><FONT color=brown>specimens</FONT></I> of many insect species. As in the last case, <I><FONT color=brown>specimen</FONT></I> can often imply that something is dead or has been killed, but this is not always so: cages to separate the healthy <I><FONT color=brown>specimens</FONT></I> from those that had contracted the disease. Beyond the scientific context, the word can apply to anything that seems representative of a type or larger whole: a perfect <I><FONT color=brown>specimen</FONT></I> of farcical fiction; checking the endorsement against other <I><FONT color=brown>specimens</FONT></I> of the man’s signature. When applied to a person, the word suggests someone noticeably typical, eccentric or physically impressive; in this use, an ironic tone may be present: a standard <I><FONT color=brown>specimen</FONT></I> of the conformist, middle-class liberal; odd <I><FONT color=brown>specimens</FONT></I> of underworld life; a girl who was quite a succulent <I><FONT color=brown>specimen</FONT></I>; a real <I><FONT color=brown>specimen</FONT></I> of a man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Example</FONT></B> is the most general of these words. While it may indicate something physically present as a <I><FONT color=brown>specimen</FONT></I>, more often the word suggests the citing of supplementary material, comparable to the similar use of <I><FONT color=brown>illustration</FONT></I>. But <I><FONT color=brown>example</FONT></I> often implies brief citations given for clarity rather than to corroborate a thesis: a list of <I><FONT color=brown>examples</FONT></I> showing faulty and correct constructions in relation to each new grammatical rule. The implication that an <I><FONT color=brown>example</FONT></I> is an aid to learning or study comes to the fore when the context is that of discipline: a punishment was intended to make an <I><FONT color=brown>example</FONT></I> of him before the whole class.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Instance</FONT></B> points to a concrete <I><FONT color=brown>example</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>illustration</FONT></I> of a general thesis, particularly one drawn from the past: asked to cite <I><FONT color=brown>instances</FONT></I> of oligarchic rule in European history. The word can refer also to an isolated or minor occurrence in the present: scattered <I><FONT color=brown>instances</FONT></I> of rioting even after the major flare-ups was over. Sometimes, the word can refer to exceptions rather than typical <I><FONT color=brown>samples</FONT></I>: a few <I><FONT color=brown>instances</FONT></I> of disagreement at the otherwise harmonious meeting. Or the word can apply to details that are part of an occurrence, even when no general thesis is being proven or defended: noting <I><FONT color=brown>instances</FONT></I> of the crowd’s behaviour as it heard the new. <B><FONT color=blue>Case</FONT></B> can function vaguely in place of other words here, but it may particularly refer to a greater body of material looked at in some detail: a presentation of <I><FONT color=brown>cases</FONT></I> in which an open conflict existed between the king and the papacy. By contrast, the word can refer to a whole argument rather than to its <I><FONT color=brown>examples</FONT></I>: his <I><FONT color=brown>case</FONT></I> for nuclear disarmament; the Crown’s <I><FONT color=brown>case</FONT></I> against the suspect. It can also refer to a specific medical or psychiatric <I><FONT color=brown>instances</FONT></I>: his analysis of some hundred terminal cancer <I><FONT color=brown>cases</FONT></I>.

<P>These words refer to what is healthful, clean, germ-free or germ-destroying. <B><FONT color=blue>Sanitary</FONT></B>, the most informal of these, pertains mostly to what preserves or is favourable to health, particularly by virtue of its cleanliness. But since it has a quasi-medical tone and suggests a degree of cleanliness quite beyond that of the word clean, it can also imply a germ-free condition: A common drinking cup may be clean without being <I><FONT color=brown>sanitary</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Hygienic</FONT></B> is much broader in scope than <I><FONT color=brown>sanitary</FONT></I>; in referring to things preserving or promoting health, it can refer more readily than <I><FONT color=brown>sanitary</FONT></I> to other aspects of healthfulness than those pertaining to cleanliness or freedom from germs: Sleeping with windows is <I><FONT color=brown>hygienic</FONT></I>. But it can refer generally to freedom from germs where the additional implications of extreme cleanliness in <I><FONT color=brown>sanitary</FONT></I> would be inappropriate: It is not <I><FONT color=brown>hygienic</FONT></I> to have a well situated on lower ground than a septic tank.</P><P>The remaining words relate exclusively to the absence or destruction of germs causing disease or infection. <B><FONT color=blue>Sterile</FONT></B> refers particularly to things made free of germs: <I><FONT color=brown>sterile</FONT></I> bandages; using only <I><FONT color=brown>sterile</FONT></I> instruments during the operation; precautions to make sure the wound remained <I><FONT color=brown>sterile</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Aseptic</FONT></B> refers especially to the absence of germs from living tissue, or to the absence of putrefactive infection; in this, it is restricted to one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>sterile</FONT></I>, with a gain in precision. This lack of infection may be fortuitous rather than induced: a cut that had luckily remained <I><FONT color=brown>aseptic</FONT></I>; using <I><FONT color=brown>sterile</FONT></I> instruments so that the incision would be <I><FONT color=brown>aseptic</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Antiseptic</FONT></B> can also refer to something kept <I><FONT color=brown>sterile</FONT></I> against germs or infection, including living tissue, though it applies to other things as well. In its particular area of relevance, it points to the counteracting of infections by the actual destruction of germs that may already be present: an <I><FONT color=brown>antiseptic</FONT></I> solution of sodium perborate.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clean">CLEAN</A>, <A href="entry://Beneficial">HEALTHFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Sanitate">SANITATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, noxious, polluted, soiled, unsanitary. </P>

<P>These words mean to clean something so as to free it of germs, pests or other unhealthful encroachments. <B><FONT color=blue>Sanitate</FONT></B> indicates to make hygienic by thorough cleaning, with the implication that anything unfavourable to health has been removed, especially anything that might spread infection or disease: a ruling that second-hand clothes must be <I><FONT color=brown>sanitated</FONT></I> before being resold. This word appears to be giving way to the American. <B><FONT color=blue>Sanitize</FONT></B> either through affectation or in keeping with other –ize verbs: a special unit for <I><FONT color=brown>sanitizing</FONT></I> toilet seats. <I><FONT color=brown>Sterilize</FONT></I> specifically suggests the destruction of germs, that is, bacteria or micro-organisms that cause infection or disease: the high temperatures used to <B><FONT color=blue>sterilize</FONT></B> surgical instruments; <I><FONT color=brown>sterilizing</FONT></I> the wound by applying antiseptic. <B><FONT color=blue>Disinfect</FONT></B> is even more specific; although the word indicates the same action as <I><FONT color=brown>sterilize</FONT></I>, it implies the presence of an infection or of infection-causing germs: a liquid designed for disinfecting toilet bowls; an antibiotic that would act to <I><FONT color=brown>disinfect</FONT></I> the inflamed tissue.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fumigate</FONT></B> means to subject to smoke or fumes in order to kill germs or insect pests: to <I><FONT color=brown>fumigate</FONT></I> a sickroom to prevent the spread of contagion; to <I><FONT color=brown>fumigate</FONT></I> a flat by spraying it with insecticides. <B><FONT color=blue>Decontaminate</FONT></B> may sometimes apply in a general way. It has gained a specific meaning that refers to the destroying or neutralizing of poisonous chemicals or radioactivity that has pervaded an area: terms sent in to <I><FONT color=brown>decontaminate</FONT></I> all but the central area irradiated by the atomic explosion.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clean">CLEAN</A>, <A href="entry://Sanitary">SANITARY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Pollute">POLLUTE</A>, <A href="entry://Soil">SOIL</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>sarcastic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>biting caustic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cutting</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sardonic</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to sharp, contemptuous behaviour towards someone, specially when it is of a verbal nature. <B><FONT color=blue>Sarcastic</FONT></B>, which comes from a root meaning to tear flesh or to sneer, describes a person, statement, expression, attitude or tone of voice that is heavily ironic. A <I><FONT color=brown>sarcastic</FONT></I> comment is generally scornful or taunting in tone, often expressing the opposite of what it literally says. The word <I><FONT color=brown>sarcastic</FONT></I>, in fact, often points opposite of what it literally says. The word <I><FONT color=brown>sarcastic</FONT></I>, in fact, often points to obnoxious arrogance, lacerating mockery or wryly contemptuous teasing. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>sardonic</FONT></B>, which comes from a foot that refers to a poison causing fatal, laughter-like convulsions, emphasizes a less direct or aggressive approach in favour of a mocking or sneering attitude that may be witty, ironic or laughter-provoking. Where <I><FONT color=brown>sarcastic</FONT></I> suggests an attempt to express and inspire contempt, <I><FONT color=brown>sardonic</FONT></I> stresses the intent to ridicule. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>sarcastic</FONT></I> suggests single, ad hominem utterances, whereas sardonic may suggest a more far-teaching general attitude of sombre cynicism that is not always directed at a person: his <I><FONT color=brown>sarcastic</FONT></I> remarks about the "speed" and "competence" of the waiters; his <I><FONT color=brown>sardonic</FONT></I> view of the possibilities for social reform; She kept her audience in stitches with the <I><FONT color=brown>sardonic</FONT></I> quips she tossed off half-consciously under her breath; meeting the students?brash, <I><FONT color=brown>sarcastic</FONT></I> laughter with a chilling, <I><FONT color=brown>sardonic</FONT></I> smile.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Biting</FONT></B> refers most specifically to remarks alone, but suggests incisive or telling utterances that may express animus but need not be personal in intent: a <I><FONT color=brown>biting</FONT></I> critique of bureaucratic inefficiency. <B><FONT color=blue>Cutting</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>biting</FONT></I>, but here the word specifically indicates a harsh, personal rejection: a <I><FONT color=brown>cutting</FONT></I> remark on his bad manner; turning away from him with a <I><FONT color=brown>cutting</FONT></I> disdain. <B><FONT color=blue>Caustic</FONT></B> comes from a Greek root meaning to burn. It points to a critical attitude that is so sharp in its expression as to be searing, scathing or corrosive: the <I><FONT color=brown>caustic</FONT></I> satires of an angry, embittered author; a brilliant critic whose <I><FONT color=brown>caustic</FONT></I> wit made him many enemies.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Contemptuous">CONTEMPTUOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Ridicule">RIDICULE</A>, <A href="entry://Scoff">SCOFF</A>, <A href="entry://Sour">SOUR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: complimentary, <A href="entry://Favourable">FAVOURABLE</A>, flattering.</P>

<P>These words are concerned with an adequate response to a foregoing requirement, need or expectation. <B><FONT color=blue>Satisfy</FONT></B> can be applied in all three cases, stressing in each the completeness with which something measures up to standards set in advance: <I><FONT color=brown>satisfying</FONT></I> the requirements for a Master’s Degree; unable to <I><FONT color=brown>satisfy</FONT></I> a craving for pickles; a film that could hardly <I><FONT color=brown>satisfy</FONT></I> the claims made for it during its publicity build-up. <B><FONT color=blue>Fulfil</FONT></B> functions in all three settings and may also suggest thoroughness of response; its special overtone implies a more-than-mediocre performance or one that in profound or that sets high standards: <I><FONT color=brown>fulfilling</FONT></I> the duties and obligations of his post with distinction; imaginative play projects that would <I><FONT color=brown>fulfil</FONT></I> the need for creative experimentation; high expectations that were ultimately <I><FONT color=brown>fulfilled</FONT></I>. In each of these cases, satisfy might suggest adequacy, but only <I><FONT color=brown>fulfil</FONT></I> would imply going beyond set boundaries.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Answer</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>fill</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>meet</FONT></B> are more like <I><FONT color=brown>satisfy</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>fulfil</FONT></I> in suggesting adequacy, but no more. <I><FONT color=brown>Answer</FONT></I> suggests an exact matching of candidate and specifications: a young executive who would <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I> these requirements. If the specifications are demanding, of course, <I><FONT color=brown>answering</FONT></I> them might be a measure of excellence more than a mere proof of adequacy: a director who interviewed hundreds of ingénues before he found one who could <I><FONT color=brown>answer</FONT></I> to the special demands of the role. <I><FONT color=brown>Fill</FONT></I> applies best to the situation of eradicating a lack and may leave the question of performance entirely open: She was hired to <I><FONT color=brown>fill</FONT></I> a vacancy on the staff, but despite first-rate recommendations, it turned out that she didn’t satisfy our expectations. <I><FONT color=brown>Meet</FONT></I>, more than any of the foregoing, may suggest a minimal measuring up to pre-set standards, or the difficulty of attaining them: They barely <I><FONT color=brown>met</FONT></I> the deadline; drinking just enough water to <I><FONT color=brown>meet</FONT></I> the minimum weight restriction for paratroopers. It may also stress reluctance or suggest satisfaction of certain requirements: <I><FONT color=brown>meeting</FONT></I> his demands with an air of unwilling surrender; they refused to negotiate unless three preliminary conditions were met.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ease</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>palliate</FONT></B> apply only to the situation of responding to a lack, both stressing that it is partially <I><FONT color=brown>filled</FONT></I> but not wholly <I><FONT color=brown>satisfied</FONT></I>: Troops were flown in to <I><FONT color=brown>ease</FONT></I> the shortage of rescue workers. <I><FONT color=brown>Palliate</FONT></I> is even more negative than <I><FONT color=brown>ease</FONT></I>, suggesting the lack has been disguised or concealed but not altered in any basic way: laws that have <I><FONT color=brown>palliated</FONT></I> the disease of poverty without curing it.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adequate">ADEQUATE</A>, <A href="entry://Surfeit">SURFEIT</A>, <A href="entry://Treat">TREAT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: miss, refuse, worsen.</P>

<P>These words all signify sharp in smell, taste or flavour. <B><FONT color=blue>Savoury</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>tangy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>piquant</FONT></B> mean pleasantly sharp in taste. <I><FONT color=brown>Savoury</FONT></I> emphasizes most strongly the agreeable nature of the taste, and in a related sense means appetizing, whether sharp in taste or not: to eat every <I><FONT color=brown>savoury</FONT></I> morsel of a delectable strew. <I><FONT color=brown>Piquant</FONT></I> suggests an appetizing tartness and emphasizes vividness of taste and strength of flavour. <I><FONT color=brown>Tangy</FONT></I> usually implies a touch or impression of tartness rather than a heavy or long-lasting dose: a <I><FONT color=brown>tangy</FONT></I> soft drink. It is mild in force, and is more common in informal contexts than either <I><FONT color=brown>savoury</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>piquant</FONT></I>. In extended senses <I><FONT color=brown>savoury</FONT></I> can refer to anything eagerly received: a <I><FONT color=brown>savoury</FONT></I> bit of gossip. <I><FONT color=brown>Piquant</FONT></I> suggests something that is lively and charming, and therefore of compelling interest: a <I><FONT color=brown>piquant</FONT></I> account of a contretemps with a Parisian butcher; Audrey Hepburn has a <I><FONT color=brown>piquant</FONT></I> quality that endears her to many filmgoers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Spicy</FONT></B> means highly flavoured, and usually, but not necessarily, implies that the strong seasoning is pleasant: a <I><FONT color=brown>spicy</FONT></I> dish that included red pepper and horseradish; so <I><FONT color=brown>spicy</FONT></I> that we had to gulp water after every bite. In its figurative sense <I><FONT color=brown>spicy</FONT></I> means somewhat improper or risqué, and implies that certain included details are used to stimulate interest as <I><FONT color=brown>spices</FONT></I> are used to enhance flavour: a <I><FONT color=brown>spicy</FONT></I> story of the loves of a film actress.</P><P>Anything acrid or prickly to the senses is said to be <B><FONT color=blue>pungent</FONT></B>. A <I><FONT color=brown>pungent</FONT></I> odour is not only strong, but keen and penetrating: the <I><FONT color=brown>pungent</FONT></I> smell of burning leaves; The <I><FONT color=brown>pungent</FONT></I> odour of sulpuretted hydrogen resembles that of rotten eggs. <I><FONT color=brown>Pungent</FONT></I> writing is colourful, sardonic and sarcastic, and is characterized by a piercing or penetrating quality that is at once memorable and forceful.

<P>These verbs have to do with the utterance of words or the expression of meaning. <B><FONT color=blue>Say</FONT></B> is the least formal and most general word. It may refer either to speech or writing, and is used both in direct and indirect quotation. ["I’m tired," he <I><FONT color=brown>said</FONT></I>; The paper <I><FONT color=brown>says</FONT></I> that it might rain.] In one sense, <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I> is limited to the exact words pronounced or written: I can tell you what he <I><FONT color=brown>said</FONT></I>, but you will have to figure out what he meant. In another sense, <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I> is not concerned with words themselves so much as with any means of conveying thoughts and feelings: <I><FONT color=brown>Say</FONT></I> it with flowers; a lot of words to <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I> very little; with only a smile to <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I> how much she missed him. Where <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I> stresses content, <B><FONT color=blue>speak</FONT></B> is limited to vocal utterance. This verb may indicate the basic power to make sounds or utter words: A mute cannot <I><FONT color=brown>speak</FONT></I>. It may mean to talk or make a speech. [She <I><FONT color=brown>spoke</FONT></I> of you; What did he <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I>? The lecturer <I><FONT color=brown>spoke</FONT></I> for over an hour.] <I><FONT color=brown>Speak</FONT></I> may also imply a working knowledge of language, the ability to use words properly in conversation. [Do you <I><FONT color=brown>speak</FONT></I> French? <I><FONT color=brown>Say</FONT></I> something in Spanish.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>State</FONT></B> emphasizes both content and tone. It suggests a formal declaration of fact set forth explicitly in speech or writing. [<I><FONT color=brown>State</FONT></I> your name, rank and serial number; The witness <I><FONT color=brown>stated</FONT></I> that he saw the accused at the scene of the crime; That stipulation is stated in the contract.] One may <I><FONT color=brown>state</FONT></I> such things as reasons, requirements, facts, claims or conditions. [<I><FONT color=brown>State</FONT></I> your case; State your business here.] One may speak words, lines or speeches as well as languages: words <I><FONT color=brown>spoken</FONT></I> in anger; a <I><FONT color=brown>speaking</FONT></I> part in the play; <I><FONT color=brown>Speak</FONT></I> your piece. One may <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I> words or things (in general) and prayers (in particular). [If you can’t <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I> something nice, don’t say anything at all; Never <I><FONT color=brown>say</FONT></I> die; <I><FONT color=brown>Say</FONT></I> the password; <I><FONT color=brown>Say</FONT></I> yes; He is <I><FONT color=brown>saying</FONT></I> his prayers.]</P><P>Where <I><FONT color=brown>speak</FONT></I> stresses the uttering of words, <B><FONT color=blue>verbalize</FONT></B> stresses the putting of thoughts into words ?the ability to articulate ideas or experience. Properly used, <I><FONT color=brown>verbalize</FONT></I> implies a certain fluency, the power to pin down precisely or formulate something that is hard to express: The mystic found it hard, if not impossible, to <I><FONT color=brown>verbalize</FONT></I> his philosophical position. But the formal <I><FONT color=brown>verbalize</FONT></I> seems highly pretentious and out of place when wrongly used as a synonym for express: He found it hard to express (not to verbalize) his feelings for her. In another, more common sense, to <I><FONT color=brown>verbalize</FONT></I> is to speak or write verbosely, wearying the reader or listener with wordiness at the expense of wit: a pompous old windbag given to empty <I><FONT color=brown>verbalizing</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Communicate</FONT></B> focuses on the ability of one person to make contact with another and to make himself understood. Language is an effective medium for <I><FONT color=brown>communicating</FONT></I>, but only when the speaker or writer is able to convey a message, to get across what he means. A person speaking Spanish, for example, is unable to <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> with a person who speaks only English. And an expert who may have an impressive command of technical jargon may lack the broad-based language skills needed to <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> knowledge to laymen. One may <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> not only through speech or writing but also through looks or gestures, signal or codes: prisoner who <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> by tapping on the walls; psychiatrists who try to <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> with the mentally ill. <I><FONT color=brown>Speak</FONT></I> may also imply recognition, an attempt or willingness to <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> by talking or making a sound. [<I><FONT color=brown>Speak</FONT></I> to me; <I><FONT color=brown>Say</FONT></I> something; They aren’t on <I><FONT color=brown>speaking</FONT></I> terms and they <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> through an intermediary.] In a more sophisticated sense, <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> stresses the technological transmission of information or ideas. Men now <I><FONT color=brown>communicate</FONT></I> over long distances by means of telephone, telegraph, radio, television and satellite.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conversation">CONVERSATION</A>, <A href="entry://Speech">SPEECH</A>, <A href="entry://Tell">TELL</A>, <A href="entry://Utter">UTTER</A>.</P>

<P>All these adjectives describe things that are limited in quantity or deficient in amount. What is <B><FONT color=blue>scanty</FONT></B> is barely adequate or not quite enough, whereas what is <B><FONT color=blue>meagre</FONT></B> is not nearly enough. A <I><FONT color=brown>scanty</FONT></I> meal may be ordered by a dieter, whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>meagre</FONT></I> meal suggests the pinch of poverty and may be poor in quality as well as small in amount. <B><FONT color=blue>Skimpy</FONT></B> is a more informal term than <I><FONT color=brown>meagre</FONT></I>. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>scanty</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>skimpy</FONT></I> indicates deliberate stinginess, often suggesting that more could or should be provided. <I><FONT color=brown>Skimpy</FONT></I>, thus, often implies disapproval or dissatisfaction, while <I><FONT color=brown>scanty</FONT></I> may suggest a more serious deficiency: a pretty <I><FONT color=brown>skimpy</FONT></I> serving considering that it was an expensive dinner; a <I><FONT color=brown>scanty</FONT></I> stock of emergency provisions. <I><FONT color=brown>Meagre</FONT></I> is expressive of real want, implying that more is not only desirable but is badly needed: The social worker claimed that it was impossible for the old man to live on his <I><FONT color=brown>meagre</FONT></I> pension.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Insufficient</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>inadequate</FONT></B> are limited by definition to what is not enough to fill requirements or meet needs. These words are less descriptive than <I><FONT color=brown>scanty</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>skimpy</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>meagre</FONT></I>, but they are broader in application and better suited to formal contexts, being applied to abstractions as well as to material things: The urchin’s <I><FONT color=brown>scanty</FONT></I> clothing was <I><FONT color=brown>insufficient</FONT></I> for the winter, affording him <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I> protection against the cold. Although <I><FONT color=brown>insufficient</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I> are often used interchangeably , <I><FONT color=brown>insufficient</FONT></I> is a purely quantitative term, being applied to what is not enough, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I> may be qualitative as well, being applied to what is not good enough. <I><FONT color=brown>Insufficient</FONT></I> evidence can only mean not enough evidence, but <I><FONT color=brown>inadequate</FONT></I> evidence can mean either that the evidence is <I><FONT color=brown>insufficient</FONT></I> or that it is of dubious quality.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sparse</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scarce</FONT></B> also refer to what is not abundant, but they have to do with occurrence and do not necessarily involve need. <I><FONT color=brown>Sparse</FONT></I> is opposed to dense or thick, describing what is widely scattered in isolated clumps: <I><FONT color=brown>sparse</FONT></I> vegetation; a <I><FONT color=brown>sparse</FONT></I> crowd scattered thinly through the auditorium. What is <I><FONT color=brown>scarce</FONT></I> is in short supply temporarily, hard to get at a given time or in a given place: During World War II, tea was <I><FONT color=brown>scarce</FONT></I> and was rationed.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lack">LACK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adequate">ADEQUATE</A>, <A href="entry://Prevalent">PREVALENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean to separate and distribute widely. <B><FONT color=blue>Scatter</FONT></B> is the most general word of this group, and simply indicates the act of driving away or throwing about in different directions. [The wind <I><FONT color=brown>scatters</FONT></I> seed everywhere; With one bound the cat <I><FONT color=brown>scattered</FONT></I> the flock of pigeons.] <B><FONT color=blue>Broadcast</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>disseminate</FONT></B> both suggest the <I><FONT color=brown>scattering</FONT></I> of seed, but <I><FONT color=brown>disseminate</FONT></I> is now used exclusively in figurative senses, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> retains its literal meaning of sowing by <I><FONT color=brown>scattering</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> seed. In a related sense <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>disseminate</FONT></I> both mean to make public or publish: to <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> gossip; to <I><FONT color=brown>disseminate</FONT></I> the Gospel. <I><FONT color=brown>Disseminate</FONT></I> is broader in scope than <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> and implies a wider audience and usually a longer duration: a lifetime <I><FONT color=brown>disseminating</FONT></I> knowledge and spiritual guidance to those in need of it. <I><FONT color=brown>Broadcast</FONT></I>, on the other hand, may indicate only a single occurrence of making something public; in the sense here considered it has a decidedly formal tone and sounds more appropriate in old-fashioned contexts than in contemporary ones: It was indelicate of the man to <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> the intelligence that his wife was cuckolding him. Today <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> has become more widely used to refer to the transmission of sounds by radio or television: a radio station that <I><FONT color=brown>broadcasts</FONT></I> news every hour on the hour; to <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> a prize fight. Although <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> is used of television as well as radio, "telecast," formed on analogy with <I><FONT color=brown>broadcast</FONT></I> and the more common "televise" seem in time likely to replace it in such context.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Diffuse</FONT></B> emphasizes the relationship between the area covered and the relative density of the material spread out over it: the greater the area, the lower the density of the material. [The cloud cover <I><FONT color=brown>diffused</FONT></I> the light of the sun; The <I><FONT color=brown>diffused</FONT></I> light of the candles on every table lent a pleasant, intimate air to the restaurant.] Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>diffused</FONT></I> often indicates a graduated lessening of intensity over a broad area, <B><FONT color=blue>disperse</FONT></B> suggests a wide and sometimes forcible <I><FONT color=brown>scattering</FONT></I> of elements or individual things: The mounted police quickly <I><FONT color=brown>dispersed</FONT></I> the unruly crowd. <I><FONT color=brown>Disperse</FONT></I> is often used figuratively: to <I><FONT color=brown>disperse</FONT></I> doubts and fears and instil confidence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Divide">DIVIDE</A>, <A href="entry://Permeate">PERMEATE</A>, <A href="entry://Spread">SPREAD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Gather">GATHER</A>, <A href="entry://Unite">UNITE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>sceptic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>agnostic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>atheist</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>doubter</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>freethinker</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unbeliever</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to people who question or reject accepted beliefs, particularly religious dogma. The relatively formal <B><FONT color=blue>sceptic</FONT></B> and the relatively informal doubter are alike in emphasizing someone who questions or is not sure of a given belief. <B><FONT color=blue>Doubter</FONT></B> most often refers to uncertainty about a belief already put forward; this may be a body of religious dogma or any isolated, non-religious theory: missionaries whose purpose was to convert <I><FONT color=brown>doubters</FONT></I> and harrow sinners; a detailed investigation of the cause of death, with conclusions that should convince that most conscientious <I><FONT color=brown>doubter</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Sceptic</FONT></I> can function in both these ways, but its main emphasis is on the questioning of accepted beliefs, perhaps not so much from a position of open-minded uncertainty as from one of an a priori conviction about where the truth lies: a confirmed <I><FONT color=brown>sceptic</FONT></I> about the value of any of the great religions. Most specifically, the word can refer to a philosophical belief that no final truths can be known, whether in any area of knowledge whatever or in some particular area: a <I><FONT color=brown>sceptic</FONT></I> about the validity of psychoanalytic theory. Less precisely, the word may refer to a person with a disengaged attitude of moral cynicism towards the worth or value of life as a whole: a <I><FONT color=brown>sceptic</FONT></I> who watched the fads and insanities of his time with an indifferent eye.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Freethinker</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unbeliever</FONT></B> are more closely tied to a rejection of religious belief than the previous pair. The first is an approving word, the second a disapproving word for the same sort of person, one who rejects the truth of a given religion or of all religions. <I><FONT color=brown>Unbeliever</FONT></I> might most often be used by a group of religious adherents to describe anyone not of their faith: a small, fanatical sect who regarded members of other religions as <I><FONT color=brown>unbelievers</FONT></I> doomed to suffer the torments of hell. More precisely, the word would indicate someone who belongs to no organized religion, or someone without religious beliefs of any sort; this sets it apart from doubter, which might indicate someone who belongs to a religion but is wavering in his convictions: addressing his sermons to doubters rather than to outright <I><FONT color=brown>unbelievers</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Freethinker</FONT></I> emphasizes someone who has asserted the right to think and decide for himself about religious dogma; the word need not point to unbelief, but rather to a nonconforming, heterodox, approach that picks and chooses from one or many religions those things, if any, that seem worthy of belief: a <I><FONT color=brown>freethinker</FONT></I> who subscribed to the Sermon on the Mount, the Upanishads and the writings of Darwin, Freud and Lao-tzu; a <I><FONT color=brown>freethinker</FONT></I> who objected to the attitude of most religions towards women.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agnostic</FONT></B> relates roughly to <I><FONT color=brown>sceptic</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>doubter</FONT></I>, while <B><FONT color=blue>atheist</FONT></B> is more comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>unbeliever</FONT></I>; both terms can be used in neutral description rather than in approval or disapproval. As widely used by the public press, political leaders and mass-circulation magazines, <I><FONT color=brown>atheist</FONT></I> is a contemptuous term, as witness its common coupling with communism: <I><FONT color=brown>atheistic</FONT></I> communism. <I><FONT color=brown>Agnostic</FONT></I> suggests someone who feels that no religious certainty is possible and that no proof or disproof of such a thing as the existence of God is valid: neither a believer nor <I><FONT color=brown>unbeliever</FONT></I>, but an <I><FONT color=brown>agnostic</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Atheist</FONT></I> is the most specific of these words in being restricted to someone who does not believe in the existence of any sort of divinity: an <I><FONT color=brown>atheist</FONT></I> with a rigorous moral code based on the Ten Commandments.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Distrustful">DISTRUSTFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Doubt">DOUBT</A>, <A href="entry://Doubtful">DOUBTFUL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: believer, bigot, pietist, religious, zealot.</P>

<P>These words mean to show one’s disapproval or scorn by making remarks intended to belittle or disparage. To <B><FONT color=blue>scoff</FONT></B> is to speak slightingly and with derision of something usually accorded honour, reverence or respect by others: to <I><FONT color=brown>scoff</FONT></I> at someone’s fervent patriotism; to <I><FONT color=brown>scoff</FONT></I> at advice given by one’s elder; to <I><FONT color=brown>scoff</FONT></I> at the teachings of a church. To <B><FONT color=blue>poke fun</FONT></B> is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>scoff</FONT></I> and most of the other words in this essay, except that it is milder in tone and used more informally: She <I><FONT color=brown>poked fun</FONT></I> at the colour of his new tie.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sneer</FONT></B> carries a much stronger feeling of cynicism, superciliousness and the deliberate wish to wound. To <I><FONT color=brown>sneer</FONT></I> is to make a contemptuous contortion of the facial muscles while uttering brief, cutting remarks that are intended to cast an unfavourable light on whatever is being attacked: to <I><FONT color=brown>sneer</FONT></I> at an adolescent’s attempts to be grown-up and independent; to <I><FONT color=brown>sneer</FONT></I> at the furniture in someone’s home.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Jeer</FONT></B> means to <I><FONT color=brown>scoff</FONT></I> in a rude and open way. It carries the suggestion of mocking laughter and even shouting or booing: During the French Revolution crowds in the street <I><FONT color=brown>jeered</FONT></I> at the prisoners being driven to the guillotine.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gibe</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>taunt</FONT></B> mean to rail at someone with sarcastic and contemptuous remarks: During the radio interview, the critic <I><FONT color=brown>gibed</FONT></I> at the young novelist for imitating Hemingway’s style in his work. <I><FONT color=brown>Gibe</FONT></I>, however, also retains some of the meaning residing in its French derivation ?"to treat roughly in play" ?and <I><FONT color=brown>gibing</FONT></I> may also be good-natured bantering or twitting: The two old men who met daily on the park bench constantly <I><FONT color=brown>gibed</FONT></I> at each other about their political opinions. <I><FONT color=brown>Taunt</FONT></I> is a stronger word than <I><FONT color=brown>gibe</FONT></I>. It means to insult and upbraid in a defiant way and also carries overtones of reproach: The fifth-class pupils <I><FONT color=brown>taunted</FONT></I> the new boy because he spoke broken English and did not know how to play cricket. As in <I><FONT color=brown>gibe</FONT></I>, there may be an element of teasing in <I><FONT color=brown>taunt</FONT></I>, but such teasing is likely to be harsh and cruel.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Despise">DESPISE</A>, <A href="entry://Laugh">LAUGH</A>, <A href="entry://Ridicule">RIDICULE</A>, <A href="entry://Sarcastic">SARCASTIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Praise">PRAISE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to unprincipled people, especially men, who are unethical or immoral in their behaviour, particularly for their own gain or pleasure. <B><FONT color=blue>Scoundrel</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>villain</FONT></B> are the strongest terms here, referring to someone who will stop at nothing to gain this own ends. Though a <I><FONT color=brown>scoundrel</FONT></I>, by implication, often works by subterfuge, lies and deception, the word’s strong disapproval suggests the actual harming of other people in cruel of needless ways: a <I><FONT color=brown>scoundrel</FONT></I> who sold sub-standard concrete for a school building, which later collapsed, killing several children. The word is losing some of its force, however, and can now be applied as a term of endearment for someone who is brash, dauntless or impetuous in his life of affections: admitting that she liked the <I><FONT color=brown>scoundrel</FONT></I> for the brazen way he chased after her. <I><FONT color=brown>Villain</FONT></I> has had a somewhat similar history; it literally describes a man of unprinciple, depraved action, one to whom behaviour as a <I><FONT color=brown>scoundrel</FONT></I> comes naturally. It thus took on an anti-hero connotation but, like <I><FONT color=brown>scoundrel</FONT></I>, it is frequently used with some affection: Hitler has been called the greatest <I><FONT color=brown>villain</FONT></I> in history; a real <I><FONT color=brown>villain</FONT></I> with the girls.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Heel</FONT></B> has recently become the most popular informal term here for any person one disapproves of, especially one who may not act illegally but who offends common decency in some way. Heinous offences are not necessarily implied by the word: acting like a perfect <I><FONT color=brown>heel</FONT></I> in promising to meet her then standing her up cold. <B><FONT color=blue>Cad</FONT></B> now give a 19<SUP>th</SUP> century flavour and is seldom used, except comically. It once specifically suggested a man who treated women without respect: a <I><FONT color=brown>cad</FONT></I> who ruined her virtue and then refused to marry her. <B><FONT color=blue>Knave</FONT></B> is even more archaic in flavour, referring to any liar, cheat, deceiver or scoundrel. Once as strong in condemnation as <I><FONT color=brown>scoundrel</FONT></I>, the word is now weak-sounding and seldom used: a sly <I><FONT color=brown>knave</FONT></I>, always scheming.</P><P>The remaining words are vague about the offences committed by the person referred to; the words may suggest disreputable or unfeeling people rather than those committed to outright immorality or villainy. <B><FONT color=blue>Rascal</FONT></B> suggests an amoral person, usually a man, who treats standards of conduct lightly and is inconsiderate of the feelings of others when these stand in the way of his desires: a <I><FONT color=brown>rascal</FONT></I> who went about cadging drinks from everyone at the bar. The word often suggests an appealing eccentric or curmudgeon and is often used affectionately as a way of accepting the faults of a loved one: never dreaming that the handsome <I><FONT color=brown>rascal</FONT></I> she was going out with would end up marrying her. The word is used also for infants or pets, implying a lovable liveliness or cuteness: obvious by his cries that it was the little <I><FONT color=brown>rascal’s</FONT></I> feeding time; teaching the comical <I><FONT color=brown>rascal</FONT></I> to beg for scraps. <B><FONT color=blue>Scamp</FONT></B> suggests a high-spirited or wandering rake or good-for-nothing who seeks amusement, pleasure or gain regardless of the consequences. Used unfavourably, the word denotes a tricky or evasive fellow ?a schemer and a cheat. Sometimes it is applied endearingly to a playful pet or to a person given to pranks or escapades: The puppies were happy little <I><FONT color=brown>scamps</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scallywag</FONT></B> is now a half-admiring word for any amoral taker of pleasures; one who may disregard niceties or decorum. The word was once more opprobrious, like <I><FONT color=brown>scoundrel</FONT></I>. It was originally a term of contempt suggesting someone who was disloyal, unprincipled and willing to do anything to get ahead. Now, like other words here, it can be used in vague ways as an affectionate term: smiling as she upbraided the darling little <I><FONT color=brown>scallywag</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Rogue</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>knave</FONT></I>, was once strongly disapproving but now has chiefly an archaic flavour that makes it seldom used, except comically or endearingly to describe a zesty, brawling, devil-may-care reveller: a <I><FONT color=brown>rogue</FONT></I> who could always be counted on to cut up at parties and generally cause all sorts of devilment.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Depraved">DEPRAVED</A>, <A href="entry://Mischievous">MISCHIEVOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Unethical">UNETHICAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: gentleman.</P>

<P>These words apply to anything that lacks or eschews frivolity or merriment because of social restraint, unsparing dedication or urgent conditions. The emphasis of both <B><FONT color=blue>sedate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>staid</FONT></B> is on restraint in manners or behaviour. <I><FONT color=brown>Sedate</FONT></I> points to unruffled self-possession and implies an exterior of correctness, politeness and propriety: a <I><FONT color=brown>sedate</FONT></I> gathering of quiet but interesting people; <I><FONT color=brown>sedate</FONT></I> matrons who sit supreme and secure in their church pews. Tow word can sometimes apply critically to people or man-made things that are genteel or too refined: the <I><FONT color=brown>sedate</FONT></I> indifference of well-bred snobs to the miseries of the lower classes. When applied outside the context of human affairs, the word can refer more generally to anything serene or tranquil: the <I><FONT color=brown>sedate</FONT></I> hush after the hymn. <I><FONT color=brown>Staid</FONT></I> is now used most commonly in a way comparable to the negative possibility for <I><FONT color=brown>sedate</FONT></I>, referring to manners that are straitlaced, unbending, prim and pompous: plays that shock the sensibilities of <I><FONT color=brown>staid</FONT></I> ladies who attend avant-garde theatres.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Solemn</FONT></B> once could refer almost exclusively to an extremely formal and awe-inspiring religious ritual: a <I><FONT color=brown>solemn</FONT></I> Requiem Mass. This was extended to other rituals or formalities expressing a total commitment: a <I><FONT color=brown>solemn</FONT></I> oath; a <I><FONT color=brown>solemn</FONT></I> dedication to the cause of freedom. Now the word can refer also to a person or manner that is unleavened by lightheartedness: the <I><FONT color=brown>solemn</FONT></I> faces of wives awaiting the results of the mining disaster. As a word of disapproval, it can point to someone needlessly gloomy or lacking in humour: <I><FONT color=brown>solemn</FONT></I> parents aghast at the most innocuous amusement of their children.</P><P>When applied to a lack of humour, <B><FONT color=blue>serious</FONT></B> is much more neutral in tone; depending upon context, it can be approving, strictly factual or disapproving: a play that he spoke of as the only really <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> attempt at contemporary drama currently to be seen on the stage; promising to give the proposal her <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> consideration; He couldn’t bear people who were so <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> all the time. In a comparable context, <B><FONT color=blue>grave</FONT></B> emphasizes an extremely <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> manner that is intense and unrelieved. It may suggest a concerned, anxious troubled state, as well: She gave him a <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> look that showed how alarmed she was; inspecting his son’s report card with a <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> frown. When both words apply to a state of urgency or crisis, serious suggests an uncertain condition that could well result in danger or failure: in <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> condition following his heart attack. <I><FONT color=brown>Grave</FONT></I>, however, may well suggest a state too far gone to expect full recovery, although the word can be applied for emphasis to less extreme conditions: a <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> lack of food and water in the lifeboat; a <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> problem facing the nation. Both words can also be used for anything thought extremely bad; in this case, <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> is again an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> lack of concern for others; a <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> defiance of the law.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sober</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>earnest</FONT></B> apply more strictly than the foregoing words to human behaviour and attitudes alone. <I><FONT color=brown>Sober</FONT></I> can refer at its most restricted to someone who is free of the influence of alcohol or psychedelic drugs: a test to determine whether the driver was drunk or <I><FONT color=brown>sober</FONT></I>. Used more generally, the word can suggest a wide-eyed, clear-headed approach, particularly in response to a <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> situation: a <I><FONT color=brown>sober</FONT></I> look at a growing political danger. It can also indicate unwavering devotion to a task: a life spent in <I><FONT color=brown>sober</FONT></I> dedication to the advancement of medicine. <I><FONT color=brown>Earnest</FONT></I> stresses this last possibility for <I><FONT color=brown>sober</FONT></I> and adds implications of zeal, selflessness and single-mindedness: the <I><FONT color=brown>earnest</FONT></I> pursuit of his studies; <I><FONT color=brown>earnest</FONT></I> youngsters who express their idealism by joining Australian Volunteers Abroad. The word can apply also to a momentary involvement in which someone is engrossed or becomes impassioned: <I><FONT color=brown>earnest</FONT></I> attention from his originally restless audience; <I><FONT color=brown>earnest</FONT></I> requests for more information during the question period. Neither <I><FONT color=brown>sober</FONT></I> nor <I><FONT color=brown>earnest</FONT></I> is useful in expressing disapproval for someone who is habitually <I><FONT color=brown>solemn</FONT></I> or over-<I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dedicate">DEDICATE</A>, <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Formal">FORMAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: easy-going, flighty, frivolous, <A href="entry://Jaunty">JAUNTY</A>, light-hearted.</P>

<P>These words refer to the moving of objects or materials from one point to another. <B><FONT color=blue>Send</FONT></B> is the least formal and the most general of these words, carrying no implications about what is sent or how: <I><FONT color=brown>sending</FONT></I> ma answer by return mail; <I><FONT color=brown>sending</FONT></I> half-a-dozen trunks ahead by boat. With <I><FONT color=brown>send</FONT></I>, the movement is viewed specifically from the point of origin rather than from its destination: wondering if he ever received the letter I <I><FONT color=brown>sent</FONT></I> a month ago.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dispatch</FONT></B> suggests urgency or speed: <I><FONT color=brown>dispatching</FONT></I> three fire engines to combat the blaze; <I><FONT color=brown>dispatching</FONT></I> a messenger who would give them the news before sundown. The word may also suggest a central agent who assigns vehicles to specific tasks: <I><FONT color=brown>dispatching</FONT></I> a fleet of taxis by radio to all points in the city. With <B><FONT color=blue>deliver</FONT></B>, the movement of an object can be viewed exclusively in terms of the point of destination: Until the advent of the semi-trailer, most manufactured goods were <I><FONT color=brown>delivered</FONT></I> to country areas by rail. But in the context of retail selling, the word is often synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>send</FONT></I>: dealing only with stores that <I><FONT color=brown>deliver</FONT></I>; asking that they <I><FONT color=brown>deliver</FONT></I> the groceries in an hour.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Forward</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>transmit</FONT></B> imply a movement that is less than direct, for varying reasons. <I><FONT color=brown>Forward</FONT></I> suggests an intermediate or incorrect destination from which the object must then travel to its ultimate goal: a variety of Russian goods that are <I><FONT color=brown>forwarded</FONT></I> through Sweden; <I><FONT color=brown>forwarding</FONT></I> the letter to his new address. <I><FONT color=brown>Transmit</FONT></I> may suggest the <I><FONT color=brown>sending</FONT></I> of the contents or equivalent of a document or thing, rather than the original itself: <I><FONT color=brown>transmitting</FONT></I> the details of the high-level conference to the Prime Minister himself; <I><FONT color=brown>transmitting</FONT></I> the message by ship-to-shore telephone. <B><FONT color=blue>Ship</FONT></B> indicates the moving of produce or effects by sea, air, rail or truck. It now usually suggests a commercial operation and, if effects are involved, transportation that is unaccompanied by the owner himself: leaving our furniture to be <I><FONT color=brown>shipped</FONT></I> after us; goods scheduled to be <I><FONT color=brown>shipped</FONT></I> by rail or road transport.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Carry">CARRY</A>, <A href="entry://Go">GO</A>, <A href="entry://Move">MOVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: keep, receive, retain.</P>

<P>These words are comparable but not closely synonymous when used to refer to a response to a stimulus or to the ability to make such a response. In a technical sense, <B><FONT color=blue>sensation</FONT></B> is applicable to an impression originating either from within or from outside the body and conveyed to the nervous system by the organs of seeing, hearing, touching, tasting or smelling. The word does not necessarily imply an identification of the stimulus: to experience a <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I> of warmth. In general usage, the meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I> is extended to include not only sensing but also the attendant emotional and mental responses: to have a <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I> that everyone in the room is staring at you; a recollection that brought a <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I> of sadness.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sense</FONT></B>, as here considered, may refer strictly to the physical agencies (taste, touch, sight, hearing and smell) by or through which a person or animal receives impressions from outside his own organism. In the plural it is applicable to the total awareness of the world about one: After the accident he came to his <I><FONT color=brown>senses</FONT></I> in a hospital bed. Whatever one experiences through the <I><FONT color=brown>senses</FONT></I> is a sensation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Perception</FONT></B> in this context involves interpretation of a stimulus and recognition of the object that produces a <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Perception</FONT></I> is always based on earlier experience and is the process by which one becomes acquainted with his environment. Whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I> does not suggest the agency of the mind, <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I> implies that the stimulus creating a <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I> has been registered, however unconsciously, on the brain ?checked in, as it were, like a guest in a hotel.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Percept</FONT></B>, closely related in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I>, is a term in psychology and is applied to the immediate knowledge and recognition of an external object gained by perceiving it. A dog will have the <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I> of seeing or even of smelling a chair; he knows that it is an obstacle to be walked round, but he will gain no <I><FONT color=brown>percept</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I> of what a chair actually is.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Feeling</FONT></B>, the most general term in the group; is sometimes used loosely in place of <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>sensation</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I>. More precisely, <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I> applies to the faculty by which one perceives <I><FONT color=brown>sensations</FONT></I> of pain, pressure, heat and cold, contact, etc. It may refer also to kinaesthesia ?the perception of muscular movement, tension or tone derived from the functioning of nerves connected with muscle tissue, skin, joints and tendons: After his spinal injury, he had no <I><FONT color=brown>feeling</FONT></I> in his legs.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aware">AWARE</A>, <A href="entry://Emotion">EMOTION</A>, <A href="entry://Observant">OBSERVANT</A>, <A href="entry://Perceive">PERCEIVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words indicate an intelligent and objective approach to problems or behaviour that is temperate, fair and sound. <B><FONT color=blue>Sensible</FONT></B> puts less emphasis on intelligence than on common sense; it suggests an attitude that is prudent, calmly controlled, considerate, understanding and aware of consequences by virtue of distilled experience: the few <I><FONT color=brown>sensible</FONT></I> men who refused to indulge in the foolish fads of the day; a <I><FONT color=brown>sensible</FONT></I> approach to a controversial subject; the plain, <I><FONT color=brown>sensible</FONT></I> people who are the backbone of the nation. <B><FONT color=blue>Reasonable</FONT></B> is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>sensible</FONT></I> in emphasizing the value of distilled experience; but its connotations are slightly different in suggesting an approach or situation that is fair, just, objective or unemotional in its avoidance of extremes: a <I><FONT color=brown>reasonable</FONT></I> price; <I><FONT color=brown>reasonable</FONT></I> neighbours who did not object to the occasional parties he held; asking his son to be <I><FONT color=brown>reasonable</FONT></I> about his demands for the family car. Oddly enough, <B><FONT color=blue>rational</FONT></B> rather than <I><FONT color=brown>reasonable</FONT></I> is the word here that is most emphatic about the value of reason as a guide; this contrasts with the stress on experience implied by the previous words. Most specifically, it points to a problem-solving process of thinking that employs valid or logical methods in reaching conclusions: a <I><FONT color=brown>rational</FONT></I> way of going about the vast tasks involved in city planning; a <I><FONT color=brown>rational</FONT></I> explanation for the enigmatic events surrounding the catastrophe. <I><FONT color=brown>Rational</FONT></I> may also indicate a coherent mind, one that is not mentally unbalanced or at the mercy of overpowering emotions: becoming more <I><FONT color=brown>rational</FONT></I> as the tranquillizer took effect; psychiatrists who debated if the accused man was <I><FONT color=brown>rational</FONT></I> enough to stand trial.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lucid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sane</FONT></B> are both directed to this last meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>rational</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Lucid</FONT></I> indicates a mind free of internal pressures or distortions: <I><FONT color=brown>lucid</FONT></I> intervals between bouts of catatonic depression. It can refer to a <I><FONT color=brown>rational</FONT></I> approach or train of thought that is particularly clear, understandable of helpful in its simplicity: a <I><FONT color=brown>lucid</FONT></I> argument against the theories advanced in the article. <I><FONT color=brown>Sane</FONT></I> is commonly used in both ordinary speech and legal terminology to refer to someone who is not psychotic, but the word has no usefulness to psychologists: declared to have been <I><FONT color=brown>sane</FONT></I> at the time of the murders; struggling to stay <I><FONT color=brown>sane</FONT></I> in a mad world. <I><FONT color=brown>Sane</FONT></I> also has a use akin to <I><FONT color=brown>reasonable</FONT></I> in referring to a fair, just or <I><FONT color=brown>sensible</FONT></I> approach: <I><FONT color=brown>sane</FONT></I> legislation to deal with an increasingly urgent problem; <I><FONT color=brown>sane</FONT></I> attitudes towards disciplining their children.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Acumen">ACUMEN</A>, <A href="entry://Mind">MIND</A>, <A href="entry://Workable">WORKABLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: confused, impractical, incoherent, <A href="entry://Psychotic">PSYCHOTIC</A>, unreasonable.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>sentence</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>condemn</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>convict</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>doom</FONT></B>:

<P>These words have to do with judgement ?the finding of guilt and the imposing of punishment. <B><FONT color=blue>Sentence</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>convict</FONT></B> are legal words, and both may be nouns as well as verbs. To <I><FONT color=brown>sentence</FONT></I> an offender is to state the penalty he must pay for a crime of misemeanour. To <I><FONT color=brown>convict</FONT></I> him is to find him guilty of the offence with which he is charged. A man on trial who has been <I><FONT color=brown>convicted</FONT></I> by a jury is then <I><FONT color=brown>sentenced</FONT></I> by a judge: He was <I><FONT color=brown>convicted</FONT></I> of murder and <I><FONT color=brown>sentenced</FONT></I> to life imprisonment. The noun <I><FONT color=brown>sentence</FONT></I> denotes the penalty imposed on a defendant. A <I><FONT color=brown>sentence</FONT></I> may be pronounced (or a person may be sentenced) in cases where guilt is admitted by the accused, is determined by a judge, or is found by a jury: let off with a suspended <I><FONT color=brown>sentence</FONT></I>; remanded for <I><FONT color=brown>sentence</FONT></I>; the death <I><FONT color=brown>sentence</FONT></I>. The noun <I><FONT color=brown>convict</FONT></I> is a term applied to a person serving a <I><FONT color=brown>sentence</FONT></I> in prison: an escaped <I><FONT color=brown>convict</FONT></I>; an ex-<I><FONT color=brown>convict</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Condemn</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>doom</FONT></B> imply severe or irrevocable judgements. Where <I><FONT color=brown>convict</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>sentence</FONT></I> are factual and neutral, <I><FONT color=brown>condemn</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>doom</FONT></I> can have high emotional connotations because of the degree of punishment or harsh treatment: an innocent man <I><FONT color=brown>condemned</FONT></I> to die; <I><FONT color=brown>doomed</FONT></I> by a tissue of circumstantial evidence. The connotations of these words can be misused by defence counsel or court reporters to win sympathy or to bolster a sensational approach. <I><FONT color=brown>Condemn</FONT></I>, however, has a more neutral use to indicate something that does not measure up to official minimum standards of health and decency: a building <I><FONT color=brown>condemned</FONT></I> as a health hazard. Sometimes, the word’s disapproval in official use has advisory rather than legal force: The bar association <I><FONT color=brown>condemned</FONT></I> the lawyer’s actions but did not disbar him. <I><FONT color=brown>Doom</FONT></I>, referring originally to Doomsday, the day of the last judgement, can still sometimes suggest supernatural powers believed to determine man’s fate: <I><FONT color=brown>doomed</FONT></I> to hell for his profligate life.</P><P>When <I><FONT color=brown>condemn</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>doom</FONT></I> apply more widely, <I><FONT color=brown>condemn</FONT></I> is still likely to carry implications of a conscious and overt man-made judgement that is harsh, excessive and cruel: Jews <I><FONT color=brown>condemned</FONT></I> to concentration camps. <I><FONT color=brown>Doom</FONT></I>, by contrast, stresses hopelessness and inevitability that may be the result of deplorable circumstances as well as covert human callousness: Slum children <I><FONT color=brown>doomed</FONT></I> to lives of poverty.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Confine">CONFINE</A>, <A href="entry://Disapproval">DISAPPROVAL</A>, <A href="entry://Kill">KILL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Exonerate">EXONERATE</A>, free, liberate.</P>

<P>These words refer to emotionalism that is excessive, unrealistic, false or affected. <B><FONT color=blue>Sentimental</FONT></B> once could refer neutrally or approvingly to the capacity for feeling deeply about serious matters; it is occasionally still used approvingly, though even here it applies to more trivial emotions, particularly to nostalgia: She kept the ribbon from her corsage as a <I><FONT color=brown>sentimental</FONT></I> remembrance of her first formal dance. Otherwise, the word is widely understood as disapproving in tone, pertaining to an inappropriate willingness to be moved at the slightest prompting or by situations that do not warrant genuine feeling. The word does not censure all feeling, only that which is trivial, forced or excessive; no one would think it <I><FONT color=brown>sentimental</FONT></I> to weep at the death of a friend; most people, on the other hand, would think it <I><FONT color=brown>sentimental</FONT></I> to supply a funeral and tombstone for, say, a pet canary that had died. <B><FONT color=blue>Romantic</FONT></B> has gone through a similar change, although the split in meaning still exists. It once referred to the expression of deep feeling, or the valuing of feeling above form. As such, it names an artistic era or indicates words of art from any period that displays this legitimate emphasis. Those who legitmately prefer a different emphasis can use the word disapprovingly to point to chaotic or formless emotionality: <I><FONT color=brown>romantic</FONT></I> blithering about originality and artistic freedom. On a much less formal level, the word can refer descriptively or approvingly to things pertaining to love between a man and woman: glances that hinted of his <I><FONT color=brown>romantic</FONT></I> interest in her.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Effusive</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>gushing</FONT></B> both refer to copious displays of any sort of emotion. <I><FONT color=brown>Effusive</FONT></I> may be approving or neutral: <I><FONT color=brown>effusive</FONT></I> in their thanks for their host’s hospitality. More often, it emphasizes excessive or insincere displays: finding his <I><FONT color=brown>effusive</FONT></I> flattery unbearable. With <I><FONT color=brown>gushing</FONT></I>, only disapproval is possible, pointing with more severity to extreme or silly displays: spinsters <I><FONT color=brown>gushing</FONT></I> rapturously over their pet poodles. <B><FONT color=blue>Mushy</FONT></B> at its most informal suggests contempt for romantic love: typical pre-adolescent boys who reject any interest in girls as being <I><FONT color=brown>mushy</FONT></I>. It can suggest also a rejection of trivial or sentimental attitudes towards such emotions: a <I><FONT color=brown>mushy</FONT></I> love story. <B><FONT color=blue>Slushy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sloppy</FONT></B> are even more critical of such attitudes towards love than <I><FONT color=brown>mushy</FONT></I>. They suggest a rejection of love seen as occasions for self-pity, weeping and a <I><FONT color=brown>sentimental</FONT></I> evasion of reality: the standard <I><FONT color=brown>slushy</FONT></I>, sudsy soap opera; <I><FONT color=brown>sloppy</FONT></I>, emotional scenes.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Maudlin</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mawkish</FONT></B> are considerably more formal than the previous pair and more specific in meaning. <I><FONT color=brown>Maudlin</FONT></I> is generally believed to have derived, through Old French Madelaine, from Latin Magdalena, in allusion to Mary Magdalene, who was often depicted with eyes swollen from weeping. The word now suggests strong disapproval for excessive emotionalism, especially of a tearful sort: a <I><FONT color=brown>maudlin</FONT></I> tear-jerker that ran as a serial in a woman’s magazine. <I><FONT color=brown>Mawkish</FONT></I> emphasizes the falsity of excessive emotions, their awkwardness and feebleness, or their offence against good taste. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>maudlin</FONT></I>, it applies to any sort of emotion, and is even stronger in its pejorative overtones: <I><FONT color=brown>mawkish</FONT></I> appeals to the stock responses and prejudices of his audiences.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Banal">BANAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: cynical, <A href="entry://Imperturbable">IMPERTURBABLE</A>, objective, realistic, sardonic, unmoved.</P>

sequence
<B><FONT color=blue>sequence</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>progression</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>series</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>succession</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are alike in denoting a group of things which come or are brought together in some particular order or according to a plan. The words are further alike in that the order they refer to is one in which the things grouped together follow one another. <B><FONT color=blue>Sequence</FONT></B> designates a following in space, time or thought, and suggests that the things brought together are done so according to some logical system: making sure the chassis parts were added in proper <I><FONT color=brown>sequence</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>sequence</FONT></I> of arguments in discourse. <B><FONT color=blue>Succession</FONT></B> emphasizes the following, on after the other, of similar objects or events, without interruption. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>sequence</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>succession</FONT></I> can, but does not necessarily, imply a logical ordering: a <I><FONT color=brown>succession</FONT></I> of hereditary kings; a <I><FONT color=brown>succession</FONT></I> of catastrophes.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Progression</FONT></B> fixes the attention chiefly upon the act, process or state of moving forwards and has particular reference to mathematics and music. A mathematical <I><FONT color=brown>progression</FONT></I> is a <I><FONT color=brown>sequence</FONT></I> of numbers or quantities, each of which is derived from the preceding by a constant relationship. Musical <I><FONT color=brown>progression</FONT></I> can designate either a succession of tones, chords, etc., or the movement from one tone or chord to another.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>series</FONT></B> is a number of things ordered or arranged according to a similarity of nature or on the basis of like relationships. Although it is therefore very much like <I><FONT color=brown>sequence</FONT></I> or succession, <I><FONT color=brown>series</FONT></I> suggests the individuality of the connected things rather than the mere fact that they follow one another: along <I><FONT color=brown>series</FONT></I> of successes in the theatre.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Organize">ORGANIZE</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>sever</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cleave</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>split</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sunder</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the breaking or cutting apart of something by force. <B><FONT color=blue>Sever</FONT></B> is a formal term for any such action, though it often specifically suggests the cutting of a part of from a larger whole: an accident which <I><FONT color=brown>severed</FONT></I> his left leg; being sure to <I><FONT color=brown>sever</FONT></I> auxiliary shoots from a plant so that they will not take strength away from the main stem. <B><FONT color=blue>Sunder</FONT></B> is an even more formal word for forceful separation, but it more often pertains to breaking something into two halves or equals. The word is now rarely used except in metaphorical sense: a civil war that <I><FONT color=brown>sundered</FONT></I> father from son and brother from brother.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Split</FONT></B> may suggest any forceful cutting or tearing action: splitting rails with a sharp axe; <I><FONT color=brown>splitting</FONT></I> his pants when he bent over. In one of its senses, however, it relates closely to <B><FONT color=blue>cleave</FONT></B>, since both words can refer to a voluntary separation within an entity, often into equal halves: the way cells split during mitosis; a varsity club that <I><FONT color=brown>split</FONT></I> up after the group’s graduation. Whereas split is informal, often extremely so, <I><FONT color=brown>cleave</FONT></I> is nearly as formal as the first pair and in most uses sounds archaic. <I><FONT color=brown>Cleave</FONT></I> has a sense of a longer cut than <I><FONT color=brown>split</FONT></I>, so that two large portions fall apart: The huge battle-axe <I><FONT color=brown>cleaved</FONT></I> through the armour and body of the knight and sank into the ground. The word can be confusing, though, since it can apply to clinging fast as well as to breaking apart: Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall <I><FONT color=brown>cleave</FONT></I> unto his wife (Gen. 2:24). In most uses this word, like sunder, appears as a metaphor: the ship’s prow, gaily <I><FONT color=brown>cleaving</FONT></I> the waves. More specifically, the word can refer to the cutting action of such an instrument as a meat cleaver: carefully <I><FONT color=brown>cleaving</FONT></I> the chops of the loin.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Divide">DIVIDE</A>, <A href="entry://Hew">HEW</A>, <A href="entry://Pierce">PIERCE</A>, <A href="entry://Shake">SEPARATE</A>, <A href="entry://Tear">TEAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Connect">CONNECT</A>, fuse.</P>

<P>These words refer to being tied or bound up so that one cannot move freely. <B><FONT color=blue>Shackle</FONT></B> refers literally to the binding of ankles or wrists or both; the bands or straps used can be attached to another person or group so shackled or to a post or stationary object: <I><FONT color=brown>shackled</FONT></I> hand and foot to the prison wall. Figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>shackle</FONT></I> suggests something that frustrates progress along a certain line: youthful minds already <I><FONT color=brown>shackled</FONT></I> by the prejudices of their parents; a government <I><FONT color=brown>shackled</FONT></I> by an inflexible foreign policy.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Manacle</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>fetter</FONT></B> both deal with a separate and specific aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>shackle</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Manacle</FONT></I> refers specifically to the binding of hands or wrists, <I><FONT color=brown>fetter</FONT></I> to the binding of feet. As with <I><FONT color=brown>shackle</FONT></I>, the binding may be by a band or strap; both hands or feet may be <I><FONT color=brown>manacled</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fettered</FONT></I> together, or one of each may be attached to one of another person’s: raising his <I><FONT color=brown>manacled</FONT></I> hands in protest: one hand <I><FONT color=brown>manacled</FONT></I> to the policeman who accompanied him; <I><FONT color=brown>fettered</FONT></I> so that he could walk only with difficulty about his cell; convicts <I><FONT color=brown>fettered</FONT></I> to each other by a heavy chain. In figurative uses, these distinctions are frequently forgotten and both words are used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>shackled</FONT></I>; on this level, fetter suggests less loss of freedom than <I><FONT color=brown>shackle</FONT></I>, and <I><FONT color=brown>manacle</FONT></I> an even greater loss: a slow-moving programme that was <I><FONT color=brown>fettered</FONT></I> by parliamentary caution; an apathetic populace <I><FONT color=brown>manacled</FONT></I> by gross need and squalor. In using any of these three words figuratively, one should remember that the literal image remains strong; ridiculous comparisons should be avoid. [The hand that rocked the cradle was <I><FONT color=brown>fettered</FONT></I> to the home; The current generation is <I><FONT color=brown>shackled</FONT></I> to its lust for speed and rapid changes of pace.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Handcuff</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tether</FONT></B> are still more specifically restricted than the foregoing words. <I><FONT color=brown>Handcuff</FONT></I> refers exclusively to two circles of metal connected by a short chain; as with <I><FONT color=brown>manacle</FONT></I>, both wrists of a person may be <I><FONT color=brown>handcuffed</FONT></I> together or one wrist may be <I><FONT color=brown>handcuffed</FONT></I> to another person’s or to a fixed object. The word is far less often used figuratively than <I><FONT color=brown>manacle</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Tether</FONT></I> suggests, most specifically, an animal tied to a fixed stake by a cord or chain that is attached to the animal at the neck. This gives a limited circle in which the animal may move or graze. Figuratively, the word implies the setting of a limited area within which freedom is permitted but beyond which it is impossible to go: <I><FONT color=brown>tethered</FONT></I> within a four-year programme of required courses; a group <I><FONT color=brown>tethered</FONT></I> to tedious pieties that no longer have any meaning.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chain</FONT></B>, while specifying the material with which the binding is done, is the most general word here in that it can refer to any manner of binding whatever. Unlike these other words, it can also suggest a more complete loss of freedom: <I><FONT color=brown>chained</FONT></I> so that he could neither stand, sit nor lie down at full length.

<P>These words refer to agitated movements that are quick, slight or intense and are often involuntary expressions of strain or discomfort. <B><FONT color=blue>Shake</FONT></B> is the most general and is also unique in this group because it can designate something that is done to as well as by a person or object: <I><FONT color=brown>shaking</FONT></I> his fist in rage; branches <I><FONT color=brown>shaking</FONT></I> in the wind. <B><FONT color=blue>Quiver</FONT></B> is more specific in suggesting a rapid but almost imperceptible vibration: ropes that <I><FONT color=brown>quivered</FONT></I> tautly under his hands; a network of ripples that <I><FONT color=brown>quivered</FONT></I> momentarily across the surface of the still pool; her whole body <I><FONT color=brown>quivering</FONT></I> with delight. <I><FONT color=brown>Quake</FONT></I> suggests specifically a more violent upheaval: the ground <I><FONT color=brown>quaking</FONT></I> beneath them as the artillery barrage began; his heart <I><FONT color=brown>quaking</FONT></I> with panic.</P><P>The remaining words apply best to the involuntary <I><FONT color=brown>shaking</FONT></I> of a persons or animal; when they are used of natural objects an anthropomorphic overtone persists. <B><FONT color=blue>Tremble</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>quiver</FONT></I> in suggesting a quick but slight movement; to this there are added implications of uneasy or nervous discomposure: hands that <I><FONT color=brown>trembled</FONT></I> with eagerness as the opened the letter; leaves <I><FONT color=brown>trembling</FONT></I> in the faint breeze.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shiver</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>tremble</FONT></I> except for specifically suggesting coldness or fear as the cause of the slight, rapid movement: beginning to <I><FONT color=brown>shiver</FONT></I> as the intense cold pervaded the room; <I><FONT color=brown>shivering</FONT></I> inwardly at the thought of having to explain to her mother why she had stayed out so late. <B><FONT color=blue>Shudder</FONT></B> suggests a more intense <I><FONT color=brown>shaking</FONT></I> than either <I><FONT color=brown>tremble</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>shiver</FONT></I>, suggesting horror, revulsion or extreme pleasure as possible causes for the involuntary movement: <I><FONT color=brown>shuddering</FONT></I> at the touch of his leathery hand. Although <I><FONT color=brown>shudder</FONT></I> may be nearly as intense as <I><FONT color=brown>quake</FONT></I>, it may suggest movement less noticeable to an onlooker: <I><FONT color=brown>shuddering</FONT></I> breathlessly in the doorway until his pursuer had raced past.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Totter">TOTTER</A>, <A href="entry://Vibrate">VIBRATE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to imitations or substitutes that are poorly or unconvincingly executed. <B><FONT color=blue>Sham</FONT></B> specifically suggests the hypocritical acting out of roles or the display of pretended virtues so as to result in a deliberate or unconscious travesty of the real thing: <I><FONT color=brown>sham</FONT></I> piety that was shown up by their actual behaviour; a <I><FONT color=brown>sham</FONT></I> though legally certified marriage entered into for financial gain. <B><FONT color=blue>Mock</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>sham</FONT></I> in suggesting an outrageously bad or hypocritical pretence to virtue, especially when done with overblown grandiosity: windy oratory full of <I><FONT color=brown>mock</FONT></I> patriotism. The word, however, has a growing use as a neutral term describe something intended to deceive no one but having a usefulness of its own: <I><FONT color=brown>mock</FONT></I> turtle soup; a <I><FONT color=brown>mock</FONT></I> battle as part of National-Service training.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fake</FONT></B> suggests a copy or substitute which may but need not be intended to deceive: <I><FONT color=brown>fake</FONT></I> loyalty that won his boss’s admiration; buying a <I><FONT color=brown>fake</FONT></I> fur to wear as a second coat in place of her real mink. <B><FONT color=blue>Bogus</FONT></B> stresses the inherent worthlessness of the copy or imitation: <I><FONT color=brown>bogus</FONT></I> sentiment; <I><FONT color=brown>bogus</FONT></I> currency. <B><FONT color=blue>Phony</FONT></B>, aside from its simple pejorative use for a deliberate deception, stresses conscious hypocrisy that is never self-deceiving: a <I><FONT color=brown>phony</FONT></I> scholar who freely made up both his quotations and his sources. <I><FONT color=brown>Phony</FONT></I> is the most informal word of this group and perhaps most pejorative in its assault of priggishness and especially pretentiousness: a <I><FONT color=brown>phony</FONT></I> show-off.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artificial">ARTIFICIAL</A>, <A href="entry://Spurious">SPURIOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Genuine">GENUINE</A>.</P>

<P>These words express various shades of meaning implicit in the general idea of feeling or of making others feel uncomfortable in situations or under circumstances that involve a loss of self-esteem. <B><FONT color=blue>Shame</FONT></B>, the strongest of them, implies a painful sense of guilt or of degradation arising from a consciousness of acting in an unworthy or dishnourable way. [They <I><FONT color=brown>shamed</FONT></I> him by their courage in the emergency; He was <I><FONT color=brown>shamed</FONT></I> by his failure to pass the final test.] <B><FONT color=blue>Mortify</FONT></B> is somewhat milder, suggesting humiliation or chagrin resulting from an unpleasant experience: The teacher was <I><FONT color=brown>mortified</FONT></I> by her pupil’s poor showing. (Note that in this sense it can sometimes be replaced by ashamed of: <I><FONT color=brown>mortified</FONT></I> by or ashamed of one’s behaviour.) It may also signify punishment or decay: to <I><FONT color=brown>mortify</FONT></I> the flesh by fasting; the <I><FONT color=brown>mortification</FONT></I> of gangrenous tissue.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Embarrass</FONT></B> means to make self-conscious or uncomfortable: a young lady <I><FONT color=brown>embarrassed</FONT></I> by her escort’s drunken behaviour at a party. It may also denote the checking or hindering of thought, speech or a course of action: an <I><FONT color=brown>embarrassing</FONT></I> setback to his plans; to <I><FONT color=brown>embarrass</FONT></I> an opponent by awkward questions. <B><FONT color=blue>Abash</FONT></B> is to confuse or disconcert, as by arousing a sudden consciousness of inferiority. [The child was <I><FONT color=brown>abashed</FONT></I> by his mother’s reproof; No amount of scorn or ridicule could <I><FONT color=brown>abash</FONT></I> him.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Discomfit</FONT></B> still carries its former military sense of defeating or routing an enemy: It was a great satisfaction to have discomfited his rival. More loosely, it can be used, instead of <I><FONT color=brown>embarrass</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>abash</FONT></I>, to suggest dejection short of actual humiliation or defeat: discomfited because he forgot the address. <I><FONT color=brown>Discomfit</FONT></I> is often confused with "discomfort," which means to make uneasy or uncomfortable. This may have little relationship with shame, but unfortunately the words are homophones. <B><FONT color=blue>Faze</FONT></B> is a colloquial American expression meaning to worry, vex or disturb and is generally used only in the negative sense: He was not <I><FONT color=brown>fazed</FONT></I> by the attacks made on his character. <B><FONT color=blue>Rattle</FONT></B>, another colloquial expression, implies a state of emotional confusion or agitation: The speaker was <I><FONT color=brown>rattled</FONT></I> by constant interruptions from the audience.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Embarrassment">EMBARRASSMENT</A>, <A href="entry://Upset">UPSET</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Uphold">UPHOLD</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to conduct or a condition that violates the prevailing standards of probity or morality. <B><FONT color=blue>Shameful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>disgraceful</FONT></B> express strong disapproval and often shock at someone else’s transgressions. Both terms are commonly used for emphasis to reveal profound indignation on the part of the speaker or writer, and are more meaningful in suggesting attitude than in objectively describing shocking situations: a <I><FONT color=brown>disgraceful</FONT></I> exhibition of poor sportsmanship; a <I><FONT color=brown>shameful</FONT></I> display of ingratitude. Strictly speaking, a <I><FONT color=brown>shameful</FONT></I> act would bring shame or obloquy upon the doer and a <I><FONT color=brown>disgraceful</FONT></I> act would bring disgrace; but this distinction is not commonly observed, and all that can be said is that <I><FONT color=brown>disgraceful</FONT></I> usually indicates a greater degree of indignation than <I><FONT color=brown>shameful</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Shameful</FONT></I> may also suggest a note of sadness rather than contempt, as at an unfortunate condition: It was <I><FONT color=brown>shameful</FONT></I> how badly out of shape the former athlete allowed himself to become. <I><FONT color=brown>Disgraceful</FONT></I> would be too strong in this context: it is limited more usually to acts that are felt to be outrageous: <I><FONT color=brown>disgraceful</FONT></I> misuse of company funds.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dishonourable</FONT></B>, though also revealing a highly critical attitude, has more objective relevance than either <I><FONT color=brown>shameful</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>disgraceful</FONT></I>, and retains more of its original sense of imputing dishonour. It is a formal word of high seriousness and would not, as the other words here considered, ever be applied to comparatively trivial circumstances involving manners or the like. <I><FONT color=brown>Dishonourable</FONT></I> applies to one’s character and to one’s good name. [It was <I><FONT color=brown>dishonourable</FONT></I> of him take credit for having written a book he had not written; The soldier was convicted of wilful desertion and was given a <I><FONT color=brown>dishonourable</FONT></I> discharge from the army.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ignominious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scandalous</FONT></B> are both closely related to shameful. <I><FONT color=brown>Ignominious</FONT></I> suggests behaviour that subjects one to humiliation; <I><FONT color=brown>scandalous</FONT></I> suggests sensational actions that flagrantly violate accepted standards of morality and hence stimulates reactions of intense revulsion or contempt. [She had a series of <I><FONT color=brown>scandalous</FONT></I> affairs that shocked the community; The police sergeant’s career came to an <I><FONT color=brown>ignominious</FONT></I> end when he was dismissed from the force for frequent drunkenness on duty.] <I><FONT color=brown>Ignominious</FONT></I> is now widely used to refer to anything that diminishes one’s self-respect: He suffered through an <I><FONT color=brown>ignominious</FONT></I> silence when asked to explain his absence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bad">BAD</A>, <A href="entry://Disgrace">DISGRACE</A>, <A href="entry://Embarrassment">EMBARRASSMENT</A>, <A href="entry://Ignoble">IGNOBLE</A>, <A href="entry://Outrageous">OUTRAGEOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Reprehensible">REPREHENSIBLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: exemplary, glorious, honourable, proud, reputable, upright, upstanding.</P>

<P>These words pertain to the coming together of two or more people to accomplish a common task or pleasure. <B><FONT color=blue>Share</FONT></B> is the most general of these and is relatively informal. It may suggest the mere dividing of a portion or activity: <I><FONT color=brown>sharing</FONT></I> the profits; <I><FONT color=brown>sharing</FONT></I> the clean-up job to make it go faster. Often an added note of friendliness or warmth of feeling is present: <I><FONT color=brown>sharing</FONT></I> together an intense, unspoken sympathy. <B><FONT color=blue>Join</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>share</FONT></I> in its informality; it may also stress good fellowship, especially in the sense of banding together for a common activity: neighbours who <I><FONT color=brown>joined</FONT></I> together in building a new house for the stricken family; spontaneously <I><FONT color=brown>joining</FONT></I> in the refrain of the song. This note of voluntary good will, however, may be totally absent: ordering them to <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> in digging the mass grave. The word often suggests the action of a person who becomes part of an already existing group: <I><FONT color=brown>joining</FONT></I> the excursion in Rome.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Participate</FONT></B>, although considerably more formal, is like one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> in specifically suggesting a <I><FONT color=brown>joining</FONT></I> or taking part in group activity: a shy student who only with difficulty learned to <I><FONT color=brown>participate</FONT></I> in the group discussions. The word implies a more active role than is necessarily the case with share or <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I>: members who <I><FONT color=brown>join</FONT></I> the club and share in its ideals but still do not <I><FONT color=brown>participate</FONT></I> in the club’s activities. <B><FONT color=blue>Partake</FONT></B> is closer in meaning to share than to join or <I><FONT color=brown>participate</FONT></I>, although it is more formal than any of these words. It might, in fact, seem excessively formal in some cases. It suggests, most specifically, the receiving or taking of portions, especially of food: picnickers who unloaded their baskets and <I><FONT color=brown>partook</FONT></I> of a sumptuous though improvised feast. Sometimes the emphasis on food is felt so strongly that the word is used even for a person eating along: <I><FONT color=brown>partaking</FONT></I> of her solitary meal.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Commune</FONT></B> is more like another aspect of share in emphasizing an intense give-and-take of quiet but warm feeling: <I><FONT color=brown>communing</FONT></I> together with wordless, unhurried glances. Like partake, the word may be used of a single person, in which case an internal dialogue may be suggested or a silent responsiveness to one’s surroundings, especially a natural setting: an old woman who sat <I><FONT color=brown>communing</FONT></I> with times long past; <I><FONT color=brown>communing</FONT></I> with nature. The last example is a stock phrase illustrating a certain preciousness that may be present when the word appears in this context.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Relates</FONT></B> in current usage has become a fad word referring to interpersonal relationships: an autistic child completely unable to relate to anyone; people who <I><FONT color=brown>relate</FONT></I> to others only on the safest and most superficial of levels.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Associate">ASSOCIATE</A>.</P>

sheer
<B><FONT color=blue>steep</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>abrupt</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>precipitous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sheer</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to terrain that rises or drops away sharply or that approaches the vertical. <B><FONT color=blue>Steep</FONT></B>, while indicating a relatively sharp inclination or a considerable departure from the horizontal, is alone among these words in indicating a gradual or steadily increasing slope, usually one that is difficult to negotiate. The word’s relativity can be seen by the fact that a grade too <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I> for a locomotive might be considered a gentle rise for someone on foot; terrain that was too <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I> for a horse to climb might not be <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I> enough to interest mountain climbers. Another even more subtle connotation of the word, not always present, is its special suitability for a rise viewed from below.</P><P>By comparison, <B><FONT color=blue>abrupt</FONT></B>, while referring to a much sharper slope, very often suggests an incline viewed from above. [We were winded by our long climb upwards along the <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I> path; They were confronted by an <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> chasm as they emerged from the forest.] This distinction does not always hold. <I><FONT color=brown>Abrupt</FONT></I> suggests sudden discontinuities in a terrain rather than the gradual change implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I>; consequently, a sharp contrast with surrounding topography is a special point of the word; the <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> and dramatic looming up of the huge rock out of the level plain. In a related, more common use, <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> refers to a sudden change: an <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> stop as they came upon the accident; an <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> change of plans.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I>, the remaining words pertain to a nearly vertical incline. <B><FONT color=blue>Precipitous</FONT></B> has special relevance to an incline viewed from above. <I><FONT color=brown>Precipitous</FONT></I> also brings to mind suddenness or unexpectedness in referring to a nearly vertical incline that is clifflike. The unique point of this word may be its suggestion of an <I><FONT color=brown>abrupt</FONT></I> drop that is dangerous or perilous: a frail rope bridge over the <I><FONT color=brown>precipitous</FONT></I> chasm. The word can be used without this implication: looking up at the <I><FONT color=brown>precipitous</FONT></I> rise of lofty buildings along both sides of the street. <B><FONT color=blue>Sheer</FONT></B> is related to <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I> in suggesting an incline viewed from below, but it is more intense than <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>sheer</FONT></I> often refers to a nearly vertical surface that may be impossible, not merely difficult, to negotiate: the <I><FONT color=brown>sheer</FONT></I> face of the high wall that stood between him and his freedom. The word also has a special implication that concerns the vertical face itself, suggesting one without break, foothold or cranny: the <I><FONT color=brown>sheer</FONT></I> surface of the cliff where not even a blade of grass had found a place to lodge.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Climb">CLIMB</A>, <A href="entry://Descend">DESCEND</A>, <A href="entry://High">HIGH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: flat, gentle, gradual, level, low, plain.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in their denotation of reducing the length, extent or duration of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Shorten</FONT></B> means to make or seem to make short or shorter, and can refer either to dimension or duration: angry with the demands of fashion that made it necessary for her to <I><FONT color=brown>shorten</FONT></I> so many pieces of her wardrobe; forced to <I><FONT color=brown>shorten</FONT></I> his lunch hour because of a heavy work schedule; trying to <I><FONT color=brown>shorten</FONT></I> the waiting time at the dentist’s by reading a magazine.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Curtail</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cut</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>lop</FONT></B> imply shortening through removal of a part of the whole. <I><FONT color=brown>Curtail</FONT></I> suggests a lessening, as in quality or effectiveness, because of the removal of some important part: a department store whose business suffered when it <I><FONT color=brown>curtailed</FONT></I> its services to suburban customers. <I><FONT color=brown>Cutting</FONT></I>, which suggests an editing process, may or may not remove something important: Some movies seen on TV suffer when they are <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> badly to fit into a shortened time slot. <I><FONT color=brown>Cut</FONT></I> may be used very generally for any shortening or reducing process: a <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> in expenditure. <I><FONT color=brown>Lop</FONT></I>, in its literal sense, refers to the shortening or <I><FONT color=brown>cutting</FONT></I> off of something which juts out, especially of tree limbs: They <I><FONT color=brown>lopped</FONT></I> the branches that poked over the fence.

To <I><FONT color=brown>abbreviate</FONT></I>, generally used in reference to words or phrases, implies shortening by the compression or omission of parts, the remainder standing for the whole: to <I><FONT color=brown>abridge</FONT></I> a novel for its inclusion in a magazine; the <I><FONT color=brown>abbreviated</FONT></I> name of an advertising agency.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compact">COMPACT</A>, <A href="entry://Decrease">DECREASE</A>, <A href="entry://Lessen">LESSEN</A>, <A href="entry://Reduce">REDUCE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Extend">EXTEND</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the revealing, demonstrating or making clear of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Show</FONT></B> is the most informal and general of these, with an extremely wide range of possible uses: <I><FONT color=brown>showing</FONT></I> her teeth when she smiled; <I><FONT color=brown>showing</FONT></I> off his new ability on the high diving board.

It can refer to a great or brilliant display, and in this sense may characterize such things as beauty, ability, technique, performance or achievement: a <I><FONT color=brown>showy</FONT></I> floral arrangement, done with originality and imagination; a pianist with a <I><FONT color=brown>showy</FONT></I> technique and a mastery of the romantic repertoire. In its pejorative sense, <I><FONT color=brown>showy</FONT></I> suggests a cheap display and is used to describe persons or things that in some way are offensive to good taste: a <I><FONT color=brown>showy</FONT></I> team of ballroom dancers whose performance was more gymnastic than graceful; the <I><FONT color=brown>showy</FONT></I> furniture chosen by someone whose knowledge of interior decoration was much more limited than her bank account.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Colourful</FONT></B> may suggest an abundance of colour or colours, usually bright and vivid, often contrasting: a <I><FONT color=brown>colourful</FONT></I> bedspread that had been crocheted by her grandmother and which was so beautiful that she used it as a wall hanging. <I><FONT color=brown>Colourful</FONT></I> can also describe something that is picturesque and full of variety: a <I><FONT color=brown>colourful</FONT></I> account of life in Samoa. Finally, it can characterize a person who draws attention to himself by his striking, individualistic or even eccentric manner: my <I><FONT color=brown>colourful</FONT></I>, crotchety old grandfather; a <I><FONT color=brown>colourful</FONT></I> character actor whose off-stage life was as flamboyant as his style of acting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Loud</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ostentatious</FONT></B> are more definitely pejorative in connotation than <I><FONT color=brown>showy</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>colourful</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Loud</FONT></I>, in the sense being compared here, is synonymous with the critical meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>showy</FONT></I>. In reference to objects, it denotes flashiness and offensively bad taste: a <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I> sports shirt with clashing colours and a jarring pattern. When it describes a person or his behaviour, it suggests crudity and vulgarity: a <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I>, coarse businessman whose back-slapping jocularity of manner failed to hide his ruthlessness of purpose. <I><FONT color=brown>Ostentatious</FONT></I> is not as pejorative as <I><FONT color=brown>loud</FONT></I>, but is nonetheless critical in its depiction of vain pretence or uncalled-for exhibition. It suggests the over-elaborate, flashy display that fails to impress because of its very excess: an <I><FONT color=brown>ostentatious</FONT></I> copy of an English Tudor house that looked ridiculous in its outback setting.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Elegant">ELEGANT</A>, <A href="entry://Gaudy">GAUDY</A>, <A href="entry://Vulgar">VULGAR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Modest">MODEST</A>, plain, quiet, simple.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>shrew</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bitch</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>harridan</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>scold</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>termagant</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>virago</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>vixen</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to vexatious, fault-finding, abusive and quarrelsome women. <B><FONT color=blue>Shrew</FONT></B> is the most inclusive in the list of faults that it may attribute to such a woman. Because of Shakespeare’s <I><FONT color=brown>The Taming of the Shrew</FONT></I>, the word is often used specifically to refer to a henpecking, domineering wife who nags her husband. <B><FONT color=blue>Scold</FONT></B>, now rarely used, emphasizes only one fault to the exclusion of others, referring to someone who is unceasingly fault-finding and who uses harsh, abusive language. While the word often applies to a woman, and may certainly apply to a wife, it is the only word here that is not necessarily restricted to women alone: not able to decide who was the worse <I><FONT color=brown>scold</FONT></I>, his boss at the office or his wife at home. <B><FONT color=blue>Virago</FONT></B> is more like <I><FONT color=brown>scold</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>shrew</FONT></I> in emphasizing a person given to ill-tempered tirades. Here the word is limited to describing a nosy, sharp-tongued woman whose talk may be harsh and incessant but not necessarily devoted solely to abuse, as is the case with <I><FONT color=brown>scold</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>virago</FONT></I> who punished her husband with a constant volley of hysterical chatter. <I><FONT color=brown>Virago</FONT></I> comes from a Latin root referring to a mannish woman, and sometimes this is reflected in the word’s use in reference to a woman of extraordinary size or Amazonian courage: often picturing Judy as a <I><FONT color=brown>virago</FONT></I> of frightening prowess and Punch as a helpless pip-squeak of a man.</P><P>With the remaining words, greater disapproval is expressed for more extremely distasteful sorts of women, often outside the context of marriage. <B><FONT color=blue>Harridan</FONT></B> refers specifically to an old woman who is hateful and vicious: <I><FONT color=brown>harridans</FONT></I> who sit bejewelled in their theatre boxes but have never entertained a kind or compassionate sentiment in their entire lives. <B><FONT color=blue>Vixen</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggests animal-like ferocity not commonly associated with advanced age. The word’s other application ?to a female fox ?supplies overtones here of a sleek, cunning woman, perhaps specifically unmarried, who is out for self-aggrandizement at whatever cost to others: a regular <I><FONT color=brown>vixen</FONT></I> who could slink about seductively one moment and lash out with tooth and claw the next. Such a woman who directs her viciousness at males is now often referred to as a castrating female. In more general use, though carrying considerable taboo, is <B><FONT color=blue>bitch</FONT></B> ?another word associated with a female animal. <I><FONT color=brown>Bitch</FONT></I> tends to embrace all the distasteful and vicious qualities of language and behaviour; she could be quite nice at times but a real <I><FONT color=brown>bitch</FONT></I> when she liked. Strangely enough, the word is not as taboo in this application as when used loosely.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Termagant</FONT></B> is the fiercest of all these words, emphasizing greater malice and suggesting a greater range of quixotic, bad-tempered, irrational hostility, indicating a woman who vents these qualities upon any who happen to cross her path, whether within or outside the domestic situation: a <I><FONT color=brown>termagant</FONT></I> who stamped into the meeting, pounded on the table and insisted that her denunciation of the chairman be given instant recognition.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Controversy">CONTROVERSY</A>, <A href="entry://Fault-finding">FAULT-FINDING<A>, <A href="entry://Wrong">WRONG</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to poor health or to a particular episode of bad health. <B><FONT color=blue>Sickness</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>illness</FONT></B> are the most informal of these terms; both refer to an episode of bad health, no matter what its duration. While the words are used interchangeably, <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> might be the more usual and general choice, <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I> the slightly more formal one. Also, since <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> can sometimes refer specifically to nausea alone, <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I> is sometimes used to avoid this implication when it would be inappropriate: overcome with <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> shortly after eating the contaminated food; an <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I> that can result in total blindness if left untreated. Furthermore, <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> can sometimes imply an episode that temporarily makes one unable to function, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I> can imply a longer-lasting siege that is accompanied by impairment but not cessation of normal functioning: a <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> that kept him in bed for two weeks; an <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I> that caused him little difficulty in his youth but began to take its toll as he reached middle age. <I><FONT color=brown>Sickness</FONT></I> can suggest external causation of the acute episode, while <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I> can suggest inherent weakness or malfunctioning as the source of chronic poor health. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I> is the word of choice for all mental disturbance, form mild neurosis to severe psychosis: the growing incidence of mental <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I>. When <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> is substituted for this neutral use of <I><FONT color=brown>illness</FONT></I>, an emotional colouration is added, implying greater seriousness or urgency or suggesting an attitude of condemnation: These monstrous crimes should be testimony enough to the killer’s <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I>. With a similar emphasis, <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> is often used in a more general way: a pervasive <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> in society that predisposes people to violence as a cure-all for their frustrations and discontents.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disease</FONT></B> is often popularly thought to apply only to sickness that is infectious or communicable: <I><FONT color=brown>disease</FONT></I> bred by poor sanitation and improper sewage disposal. But <I><FONT color=brown>disease</FONT></I> can refer as widely as sickness or illness to any kind of bad health, with the advantage that its very generality yield no implications as to whether the <I><FONT color=brown>sickness</FONT></I> is acute or chronic, mild or harsh, or long or short in duration: a form of heart <I><FONT color=brown>disease</FONT></I> caused by a genetic defect; a case of Parkinson’s <I><FONT color=brown>disease</FONT></I>; cancer and other <I><FONT color=brown>diseases</FONT></I> whose ultimate causes are still unknown; such mild viral <I><FONT color=brown>diseases</FONT></I> as the common cold. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>disorder</FONT></B> usually refers to a malfunction of mind or body that may be mild or serious, infectious or inherent, but is seen in some imbalance, as a metabolic or chemical defect, or in the improper working of some mechanism: hormonal <I><FONT color=brown>disorders</FONT></I> such as cretinism; a mental <I><FONT color=brown>disorder</FONT></I> typified by delusions of grandeur and aural hallucinations. The word can be useful because it leaves the question of cause open and points strictly to symptoms indicating that something is awry.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Malady</FONT></B> is a more formal synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>disease</FONT></I> that may seem outdated in descriptive use, although it has an emotional note of alarm that makes it useful in metaphorical situations: the denial of female sexuality that is a <I><FONT color=brown>malady</FONT></I> endemic to Western civilization. <B><FONT color=blue>Malaise</FONT></B> refers to an indefinable sense of ill-being: a predictable <I><FONT color=brown>malaise</FONT></I> that is the first sign of the onset of the disease. It aptly describes a psychological state in which someone feels ill at ease or disquieted for whatever reason: an abiding <I><FONT color=brown>malaise</FONT></I> that jaundiced his whole view of world affairs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Infirmity</FONT></B> applies most concretely to a weakness of mind or body, but nowadays it may sound too genteel as a substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>disease</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>disorder</FONT></I>; this is true, as well, in its extended uses: an <I><FONT color=brown>infirmity</FONT></I> that kept him in a wheelchair for a number of years; needless cruelty that mocks at the infirmities of others; his tendency to exaggerate ?the one infirmity in an otherwise admirable personality. <B><FONT color=blue>Ailment</FONT></B> can refer to a symptom or collection of symptoms that causes noticeable discomfort to someone: What exactly is your <I><FONT color=brown>ailment</FONT></I>? This word, too, can sound outdated, although sometimes it can have an informal or regional thrust: His lumbago is the one <I><FONT color=brown>ailment</FONT></I> that keeps him on edge day in, day out. The word formerly focused more clearly on the enervation or depletion of one’s sense of well-being. <B><FONT color=blue>Complaint</FONT></B> now functions as an informal substitute for symptom: Frequent faintness was a <I><FONT color=brown>complaint</FONT></I> she learned to live with. Sometimes, the word can specifically indicate symptoms that are confided to one’s doctor: cards on which he carefully noted every <I><FONT color=brown>complaint</FONT></I> of his patients.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Communicable">COMMUNICABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Flaw">FLAW</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: health.</P>

<P>These words refer to factors that are outstanding or crucial, or that have considerable force or effect. <B><FONT color=blue>Significant</FONT></B> suggests something that is outstanding because it is especially meaningful or excellent ?although no urgency or forcefulness is necessarily suggested: a <I><FONT color=brown>significant</FONT></I> trend in the public-opinion polls; a <I><FONT color=brown>significant</FONT></I> but often overlooked masterpiece of Hellenistic art. <B><FONT color=blue>Consequential</FONT></B> stresses that something is meaningful, cannot be overlooked or has considerable impact on succeeding events, especially of a negative nature: a <I><FONT color=brown>consequential</FONT></I> contribution to the theory of cultural diffusion; a <I><FONT color=brown>consequential</FONT></I> decision to grant the Aborigines representation in Parliament. In another context, the word can often refer merely to the possessing of wealth or status: the town’s two or three most <I><FONT color=brown>consequential</FONT></I> businessman.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Important</FONT></B>, the most general of these words, is also considerably less formal than the preceding words. As its root "<I><FONT color=brown>important</FONT></I>" suggests, it may refer to something that is rife with meaning, but it can also suggest almost every sense that any other word here more specifically points to. In any case, the word has been weakened by over-use, especially in the superlative, referring now to anything mildly interesting, noteworthy or of value: one of the most important battles of the war; an <I><FONT color=brown>important</FONT></I> new talent; an <I><FONT color=brown>important</FONT></I> trend towards smaller families.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Momentous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vital</FONT></B> both refer to things that are crucial or essential. <I><FONT color=brown>Momentous</FONT></I> stress the great and immediate impact of an event, though it also points to significant ramifications or results, like <I><FONT color=brown>consequential</FONT></I>, but without any suggestion that these need be undesirable: a <I><FONT color=brown>momentous</FONT></I> turning point in evolution; the <I><FONT color=brown>momentous</FONT></I> decision to drop the atom bomb on Hiroshima. <I><FONT color=brown>Vital</FONT></I>, in contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>momentous</FONT></I>, can indicate an element that is organic and essential to the well-being or functioning of the whole: a <I><FONT color=brown>vital</FONT></I> organ of the body; raw materials <I><FONT color=brown>vital</FONT></I> to the war effort. Deriving from the Latin word for life, it often means crucial or of life-and-death importance: a <I><FONT color=brown>vital</FONT></I> error; a <I><FONT color=brown>vital</FONT></I> question. It can also describe something dynamic, full of life and energy: a <I><FONT color=brown>vital</FONT></I> young executive; a fresh, <I><FONT color=brown>vital</FONT></I> work of art.</P><P>With <B><FONT color=blue>grave</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>serious</FONT></B>, the emphasis moves to something that is urgent or crucial and that promises to have an extremely undesirable outcome. <I><FONT color=brown>Grave</FONT></I> is the more restricted of the two, specifically suggesting something that may well have a fatal conclusion: a <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> illness; a pilot in <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> danger. Occasionally the word can refer more generally to something ponderous or solemn, with no suggestion of a negative outcome: addressing me with a <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> manner; a <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I> treatise on the new science of ethology. <I><FONT color=brown>Serious</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>important</FONT></I>, is considerably less formal and more general than the other words here. It does suggest the crucial, ponderous or solemn, like <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I>, but with less emphasis on urgency and even less on negative eventualities. Like <I><FONT color=brown>important</FONT></I>, the word has been weakened by over-use, especially in the superlative: one of the most <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> flaws in his character. Categorically, the word can distinguish the sober from the pleasant, light or comic: a <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> expression on his face; a <I><FONT color=brown>serious</FONT></I> discussion. In this use, it is milder substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>grave</FONT></I>; here, neither word necessarily suggests something usually meaningful or effective.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Weighty</FONT></B> refers to factors that are not easily disregarded: <I><FONT color=brown>weighty</FONT></I> considerations that militated against an immediate counter-attack. But it can refer also to a decisive preponderance or to presentations that are excessively lengthy, abstruse or solemn: <I><FONT color=brown>weighty</FONT></I> data that disproved the argument for spontaneous generation; a <I><FONT color=brown>weighty</FONT></I> treatment of the origins of Roman fertility cults.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conclusive">CONCLUSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Crucial">CRUCIAL</A>, <A href="entry://Outstanding">OUTSTANDING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: insignificant, <A href="entry://Marginal">MARGINAL</A>, <A href="entry://Trivial">TRIVIAL</A>, unimportant.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>silent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>noiseless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>quiet</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>still</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are comparable when they are applied to persons or things that make no sound. <B><FONT color=blue>Silent</FONT></B> simply means refraining from speech or being without noise; it does not necessarily suggest serenity or motionlessness: His <I><FONT color=brown>silent</FONT></I> reproach was accompanied by vigorous gestures; a <I><FONT color=brown>silent</FONT></I> film; a <I><FONT color=brown>silent</FONT></I> conversation between deaf-and-dumb people who communicated by sign language. Because it implies only the absence of sound, <I><FONT color=brown>silent</FONT></I> can be more emphatic than any of the other words: The crowd fell <I><FONT color=brown>silent</FONT></I> at the news that the Prime Minister was dead.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Quiet</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>still</FONT></B>, although denoting silence, have different implications. <I><FONT color=brown>Quiet</FONT></I> implies freedom from activity or commotion; still suggests an unruffled or tranquil state, and often implies that the calm is an interlude between periods of noise or agitation. In most contexts, therefore, <I><FONT color=brown>silent</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>quiet</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I> are not interchangeable without changing the sense: a <I><FONT color=brown>quiet</FONT></I> street; a <I><FONT color=brown>quiet</FONT></I> neighbourhood; a <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I> forest. Note that there is a sense of permanence about <I><FONT color=brown>quiet</FONT></I> but none about <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I>, which indeed suggests the potentiality of the opposite of stillness: a <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I> moment when they eye of the storm passed overhead. On the other hand, when referring simply to the absence of speech, and especially if used predicatively, the three words may be interchangeable: a child who keeps <I><FONT color=brown>silent</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>quiet</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I>). Even here <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I> is ambiguous, since it may simply suggest the absence of fidgeting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Noiseless</FONT></B> is used in commerce, usually to refer to machines that are inherently noisy, such as typewriters, air-conditioners and the like, in order to persuade consumers to purchase a particular brand that is supposed to be quieter than others. Like most advertising claims, it must be taken as a relative term, in this case meaning comparatively <I><FONT color=brown>quiet</FONT></I>. In more precise contexts <I><FONT color=brown>noiseless</FONT></I> means literally without any noise: the <I><FONT color=brown>noiseless</FONT></I> flight of an owl; the <I><FONT color=brown>noiseless</FONT></I> tread of a cat. In this sense it is synonymous with silent, which is also weakened in this way on occasions: What a <I><FONT color=brown>silent</FONT></I> engine this car has.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Speechless">SPEECHLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Taciturn">TACITURN</A>, <A href="entry://Tranquil">TRANQUIL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Loud">LOUD</A>, <A href="entry://Talkative">TALKATIVE</A>.</P>

<P>These words are used to describe persons or things that in some way or to some extent resemble on another. <B><FONT color=blue>Similar</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>alike</FONT></B> are close in that both mean resemblance in whole or part. [My shoes are <I><FONT color=brown>similar</FONT></I> to the ones you had on yesterday; The two office buildings are <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I> in size and shape.] The difference between <I><FONT color=brown>similar</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I> has to do with the extent of resemblance they indicate. Both words can be used in reference to a slight degree of likeness. [I don’t understand how you could have mistaken one car for the other, since only their colours are <I><FONT color=brown>similar</FONT></I>; The cousins are <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I> in age, but otherwise as different as day and night.] But when a complete correspondence is to be designated, the word with this denotation is <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I>. [All the houses in this project are <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I>.] In this connection it is interesting to note that, by the use of modifiers, <I><FONT color=brown>similar</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I> may be made to express more or less resemblance: somewhat <I><FONT color=brown>similar</FONT></I> in taste; not at all <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I> in price. Even with modifiers, however, identity can be expressed only by <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I>, since we can speak of two things being exactly <I><FONT color=brown>alike</FONT></I> but not exactly <I><FONT color=brown>similar</FONT></I>.</P><P>Those things are <B><FONT color=blue>comparable</FONT></B> that are capable or worthy of being examined together with reference to their likeness or unlikeness, or in order to ascertain their relative excellence or defects.

<P>These words describe things that are made, done, understood, etc., without undue difficulty, but they are not close synonyms. <B><FONT color=blue>Simple</FONT></B> and easy are the most general terms. In this context <I><FONT color=brown>simple</FONT></I> refers to something that is not complicated or intricate and is therefore capable of being quickly grasped by the mind. <B><FONT color=blue>Easy</FONT></B>, on the other hand, points to that which requires little effort to do: a <I><FONT color=brown>simple</FONT></I> problem in long division; the <I><FONT color=brown>easy</FONT></I> job of preparing a meal from pre-cooked frozen foods. In popular usage the words are often used interchangeably and their connotations tend to become blurred: twelve <I><FONT color=brown>easy</FONT></I> lessons in Italian for the tourist; a task so <I><FONT color=brown>simple</FONT></I> that a child could perform it.</P><P>In its most precise sense, <B><FONT color=blue>elementary</FONT></B> is applied to rudiments or first principles, as of a branch of learning or of a skill, and is therefore concerned with basic or introductory material which may not necessarily be easy or simple: <I><FONT color=brown>elementary</FONT></I> electronics; <I><FONT color=brown>elementary</FONT></I> Greek. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>elementary</FONT></I> is occasionally used as a synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>simple</FONT></I> in implying the absence of complexity, but here the meaning tends to merge with that of fundamental.

It may describe that which is superficial in a bad sense or even spurious: the <I><FONT color=brown>facile</FONT></I> smile of the hard-sell salesman. <I><FONT color=brown>Facile</FONT></I> is also used of something which shows signs of having been done with too little expenditure of effort or with undue haste. It further suggests the careless or undisciplined use of skill or dexterity: a <I><FONT color=brown>facile</FONT></I>, flowing prose style in which the author has very little to say. <I><FONT color=brown>Facile</FONT></I>, in an extended sense, points also to glibness and thoughtlessness of speech: the <I><FONT color=brown>facile</FONT></I> tongue of the born gossip. <I><FONT color=brown>Effortless</FONT></I>, while it can mean making no effort or being passive, is more often used to describe action or activities which appear easy to perform, but whose smoothness conceals a mastery achieved by long practice and control: the pianist’s <I><FONT color=brown>effortless</FONT></I> playing of a difficult sonata; the trapeze artist’s <I><FONT color=brown>effortless</FONT></I> somersaulting forty feet in the air. <I><FONT color=brown>Effortless</FONT></I> may also refer to natural endowments impossible for others to emulate: the <I><FONT color=brown>effortless</FONT></I> climbing flight of the eagle; the spectacular, but <I><FONT color=brown>effortless</FONT></I>, leaps of the antelope.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Simplified</FONT></B> means rendered less intricate or difficult and thus capable of being more easily understood, performed or used. The term presupposes an original condition of complexity that has been reduced to bare essentials: <I><FONT color=brown>simplified</FONT></I> English spelling in which the words are written as they sound; the teaching of fractions <I><FONT color=brown>simplified</FONT></I> by cutting apples into halves, thirds and quarters; a <I><FONT color=brown>simplified</FONT></I> process for making steel. <I><FONT color=brown>Simplified</FONT></I> may also have a pejorative meaning when used to describe something that suffers from being made simple to the point of distortion or uselessness: the candidate’s <I><FONT color=brown>simplified</FONT></I>, cliché-ridden suggestions for solving the complex problems of the poor.

<P>These words refer to acts that violate religious, ethical or moral standards. <B><FONT color=blue>Sin</FONT></B> has an exclusively religious connotation, referring to any act specifically proscribed by religious doctrine: a sect that considers going to the pictures a <I><FONT color=brown>sin</FONT></I>. It may be used metaphorically for any act judged improper or outrageous: a <I><FONT color=brown>sin</FONT></I> to come to your party so late; a <I><FONT color=brown>sin</FONT></I> against humanity. <B><FONT color=blue>Transgression</FONT></B> is often used as a fancier word for <I><FONT color=brown>sin</FONT></I>, as though its weightier syllables more clearly indicated opprobrium. In other uses it may suggest any violation of an agreed-upon set of rules: a clear <I><FONT color=brown>transgression</FONT></I> of the cease-fire agreement.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Wrong</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>misdeed</FONT></B> refer to evil or unjust actions; both may imply either a religious context or, more vaguely, a wider ethical context. <I><FONT color=brown>Wrong</FONT></I> suggests the giving of hurt or injury to someone: those who would unthinkingly do a <I><FONT color=brown>wrong</FONT></I> to their neighbours. The wrongful act implied by misdeed does not necessarily suggest hurt to others, but the word often seems euphemistic when used for sin: repenting his <I><FONT color=brown>misdeeds</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Error</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>fault</FONT></B> also sound euphemistic when substituted either for <I><FONT color=brown>sin</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>wrong</FONT></I>. Except in such clichés as "the <I><FONT color=brown>error</FONT></I> of his ways," <I><FONT color=brown>error</FONT></I> seems to suggest that a <I><FONT color=brown>sin</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>wrong</FONT></I> is an unintentional mistake rather than a deliberate choice. <I><FONT color=brown>Fault</FONT></I> suggests an imperfect result, a flaw or a blemish; when used euphemistically for <I><FONT color=brown>sin</FONT></I>, it seems to excuse bad conduct by suggesting that perfection, however much desired, is impossible. <B><FONT color=blue>Indiscretion</FONT></B>, most strictly, refers to an unwise or improper action, but it ahs become a vogue word for such sins as adultery, as though to minimize the <I><FONT color=brown>wrong</FONT></I> committed by attributing it to a momentary lack of judgement: a wife who was guilty of an <I><FONT color=brown>indiscretion</FONT></I> while travelling alone.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Crime">CRIME</A>, <A href="entry://Flaw">FLAW</A>, <A href="entry://Mistake">MISTAKE</A>, <A href="entry://Unethical">UNETHICAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: benefaction, good deed, <A href="entry://Goodness">GOODNESS</A>, kindness.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>sincere</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>dinkum</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>dinky-di</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>genuine</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>heart-felt</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>honest</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>open</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unfeigned</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>whole-hearted</FONT></B>:

<P>These words mean free from pretence, concealment, reservation or falsehood. <B><FONT color=blue>Sincere</FONT></B> is the most general of these and the most positive in tone, suggesting a complete absence of hypocrisy and an exact identity between appearance and reality, with added implications of friendliness, interest and kindness: a <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> expression of gratitude that went beyond mere formality. <B><FONT color=blue>Honest</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>genuine</FONT></B> stress truthfulness. <I><FONT color=brown>Honest</FONT></I> may be considerably more neutral than sincere and may describe an isolated instance of truth-telling as easily as it suggests an unvarying character trait: even the least <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> hypocrite occasionally makes an <I><FONT color=brown>honest</FONT></I> statement. <I><FONT color=brown>Genuine</FONT></I> is closer to <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> than honest in its positive warmth of tone, emphasizing that a person or thing is really what it seems: He showed <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> regret. In another sense, someone may be <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> and neither honest nor <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> confidence man.</P><P>The Australian term <B><FONT color=blue>dinkum</FONT></B> and the rarer <B><FONT color=blue>dinky-di</FONT></B> seem to be going out of general use, but have been preserved colloquially in certain contexts. When applied to persons, they are almost synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>genuine</FONT></I> in the implication of being what one seems; He is a <I><FONT color=brown>dinkum</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>dinky-di</FONT></I>) Aussie. Occasionally they may be applied to things when the above connotation of genuine is intended: This is a <I><FONT color=brown>dinkum</FONT></I> black opal. The most frequent present use of <I><FONT color=brown>dinkum</FONT></I> is adverbial, when the sense of truly or really is suggested: He will be here tomorrow ?<I><FONT color=brown>dinkum</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Open</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unfeigned</FONT></B> suggest, negatively, a refusal to play roles that might conceal one’s true nature and positively, a willingness to risk exposure and to tell all one knows. Open emphasizes telling the whole truth: begging her to be <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> with him, even if she disapproves of him. It suggests fearlessness of the consequences and can veer over into suggesting an unnecessary or hurtful frankness: to show <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I> hostility. <I><FONT color=brown>Unfeigned</FONT></I> does not necessarily suggest that the complete truth is told or expressed, but it does indicate a lack of posturing or archness: <I><FONT color=brown>unfeigned</FONT></I> delight in being with him, despite her suspicions about his behaviour. Sometimes it may suggest a sudden or unwilling revelation of one’s true feelings: an irrepressible outburst of <I><FONT color=brown>unfeigned</FONT></I> disgust.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Heart-felt</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>whole-hearted</FONT></B> stress that aspect of sincere that pertains to warmth of concern and deepness of kind or friendly feelings. <I><FONT color=brown>Heart-felt</FONT></I> can indicate a rare inward intensity that is assented to completely: giving her his <I><FONT color=brown>heart-felt</FONT></I> sympathy. The word is in some danger of seeming too flowery in many instances. <I><FONT color=brown>Whole-hearted</FONT></I> escapes this danger, with its suggestion of thoroughgoing dedication without reservation, or an undivided response to experience: giving the proposal our <I><FONT color=brown>whole-hearted</FONT></I> approval. The word also suggests emotional exuberance or enthusiasm: <I><FONT color=brown>whole-hearted</FONT></I> merrymaking.</P><P>Often, <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> appears linked with another word here as a clarifying intensification, as though the word were limited in its force. "<I><FONT color=brown>Sincere</FONT></I> and<I><FONT color=brown> genuine</FONT></I>" seems to suggest that even sincerity by itself can be pretended; "<I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> and<I><FONT color=brown> honest</FONT></I>" suggests that one can be sincere in one’s intentions and yet be in error or fail to give the whole truth; "<I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> and<I><FONT color=brown> open</FONT></I>" suggests that one could be concerned and <I><FONT color=brown>honest</FONT></I> and still be shy and reserved or hold back something of importance. Light is also cast on the felt limitations of sincere by another common type of doublet: <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> but mistaken; <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> but misguided; <I><FONT color=brown>sincere</FONT></I> but ill-tempered. These phrases imply that one may mean well and still fail to do the right thing because of a lack of knowledge, understanding or control of one’s emotions.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Brusque">BRUSQUE</A>, <A href="entry://Candid">CANDID</A>, <A href="entry://Genuine">GENUINE</A>, <A href="entry://Outspoken">OUTSPOKEN</A>, <A href="entry://Overt">OVERT</A>, <A href="entry://Truthful">TRUTHFUL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: affected, dishonest, dissemble, feigned, half-hearted, hypocritical, insincere, pretended, put-on, <A href="entry://Spurious">SPURIOUS</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer primarily to ways of uttering a succession of articulate musical sounds, especially with the human voice. In <B><FONT color=blue>singing</FONT></B>, the sound of the words differs from speech sound in that the vowels are lengthened and the pitches clearly defined. <I><FONT color=brown>Sing</FONT></I> has also come to mean to produce any succession of musical sounds. One says that a bird <I><FONT color=brown>sings</FONT></I>, that a brook <I><FONT color=brown>sings</FONT></I>, or that a skilled performer can make his violin <I><FONT color=brown>sing</FONT></I>. By extension, a poem or a piece of imaginative prose may be said to <I><FONT color=brown>sing</FONT></I> when read aloud, because the cadences are pleasing to the ear in the dame way that music is.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>hum</FONT></B> is to <I><FONT color=brown>sing</FONT></I> a tune, usually with the lips closed and without articulating the words. On the other hand, any somewhat monotonous, murmuring sound may be referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>humming</FONT></I>. [Bees <I><FONT color=brown>hum</FONT></I> as they fly from flower to flower; They flywheel in the power station <I><FONT color=brown>hums</FONT></I> softly as it spins; The streets of the city <I><FONT color=brown>hum</FONT></I> with traffic.]</P><P>Similar to <I><FONT color=brown>hum</FONT></I>, but involving singing as well, is <B><FONT color=blue>croon</FONT></B>. In general, this word means to sing or speak in a low, murmuring tone in a manner inducing quiet and repose: The mother <I><FONT color=brown>crooned</FONT></I> softly as she rocked the baby to sleep. During and since the 1930s crooning developed as a professional style of low-pitched <I><FONT color=brown>singing</FONT></I> that involved some <I><FONT color=brown>humming</FONT></I> or other individual variations.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>intone</FONT></B> are closely related and mean to sing in a solemn and somewhat uniform cadence a piece of repetitive music such as a plainsong, a psalm or a canticle. <I><FONT color=brown>Intone</FONT></I> suggests more gravity and less resemblance to music than does <I><FONT color=brown>chant</FONT></I>. [A priest <I><FONT color=brown>intones</FONT></I> the words of the Mass, but a group of choirboys will <I><FONT color=brown>chant</FONT></I> the responses.] In its more extended meaning, to <I><FONT color=brown>chant</FONT></I> is to recite something repetitiously or monotonously in a sing-song manner.

<P>These words all denote regions, localities or particular portions of space. <B><FONT color=blue>Site</FONT></B> is almost always restricted to an area of ground, small or large. It may be one that has been set aside for a particular use of activity: a building <I><FONT color=brown>site</FONT></I>; a factory <I><FONT color=brown>site</FONT></I>; a recreation <I><FONT color=brown>site</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>site</FONT></I> may be a circumscribed locale where some event has occurred: the <I><FONT color=brown>site</FONT></I> of Captain Cook’s landing at Botany Bay; the <I><FONT color=brown>site</FONT></I> of the beheading of Anne Boleyn.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>location</FONT></B> is usually a site considered in relation to its surroundings or noteworthy for some specific feature. [The <I><FONT color=brown>location</FONT></I> of the house is near the highway; The prison guards could not discover the <I><FONT color=brown>location</FONT></I> of the escape tunnel; A post office should be built in a central <I><FONT color=brown>location</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Place</FONT></B> is the most general term and may be substituted in an indefinite sense for all the others. <I><FONT color=brown>Place</FONT></I> may mean a small, circumscribed area: to take one’s <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> in line; hanging one’s coat in the proper <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I>; to find a parking <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I>. Buildings, dwellings, cities, towns or larger localities are all loosely called <I><FONT color=brown>places</FONT></I>. [The bank is his <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> of business; We are furnishing our <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> with antiques; He comes from a small <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> near Dunedin; She sent postcards from many faraway <I><FONT color=brown>places</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Setting</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scene</FONT></B> are both <I><FONT color=brown>places</FONT></I> or surroundings in which events (whether real or imaginary) occur or have occurred, and in this <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> they may be used interchangeably. However, <I><FONT color=brown>setting</FONT></I>, rather than scene, is often limited in meaning to the <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> in which the incidents of a play or narrative are laid. [The <I><FONT color=brown>setting</FONT></I> of Macbeth is Scotland; India is the <I><FONT color=brown>scene</FONT></I> of many of Kipling’s short stories.] <I><FONT color=brown>Scene</FONT></I> is more likely to be used of places in which actual events have occurred, but it suggests a less definite area than does <I><FONT color=brown>site</FONT></I>. [The meadow at Runnymede was the <I><FONT color=brown>scene</FONT></I> of the signing of the Magna Carta; A dark lane was the <I><FONT color=brown>scene</FONT></I> of the murder.] A <I><FONT color=brown>scene</FONT></I> may also be a wide or even panoramic landscape or view. [The wild mountain <I><FONT color=brown>scene</FONT></I> lay spread before our hotel.] In a spatial sense, <I><FONT color=brown>setting</FONT></I> suggests a scenic environment or one with special characteristics: a cabin in a woodland <I><FONT color=brown>setting</FONT></I>.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>spot</FONT></B> is a specific <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I>, either indoors or outdoors, of limited extent: a beautiful <I><FONT color=brown>spot</FONT></I> in which to have a picnic; finding a <I><FONT color=brown>spot</FONT></I> to plant the new shrub.</P><P>In the sense treated here, a <B><FONT color=blue>point</FONT></B> is a particular <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> without reference to the size or shape of the space occupied. It suggests a fixed location from which position and distance may be reckoned, as when one says that he sails from point to point during a cruise. Otherwise, <I><FONT color=brown>point</FONT></I> is simply a <I><FONT color=brown>place</FONT></I> of definite, though unstated, size: to visit <I><FONT color=brown>points</FONT></I> of interest in London.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Section">SECTION</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to taking the measure of something large or small in quantity or degree, or in a plane or solid space. <B><FONT color=blue>Size</FONT></B> is the most general, being applicable in all these situations: a country of great <I><FONT color=brown>size</FONT></I>; a small watermelon the <I><FONT color=brown>size</FONT></I> of your head; the <I><FONT color=brown>size</FONT></I> of the city’s population; the <I><FONT color=brown>size</FONT></I> of the rate increase. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>area</FONT></B> and expanse restrict themselves most specifically to surface measurements. <I><FONT color=brown>Area</FONT></I> is most often used in neutral description or to focus attention on a particular region: pinpointing <I><FONT color=brown>areas</FONT></I> of discontent in South-East Asia; a small <I><FONT color=brown>area</FONT></I> of tenderness just behind the left ear. <B><FONT color=blue>Expanse</FONT></B> suggests a larger space than <I><FONT color=brown>area</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>expanse</FONT></I> of virgin timberlands; an inflamed <I><FONT color=brown>expanse</FONT></I> of skin across his chest and stomach. <I><FONT color=brown>Area</FONT></I> is also used to indicate a certain portion of an abstract whole: an often overlooked <I><FONT color=brown>area</FONT></I> of anthropological research.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Volume</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bulk</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mass</FONT></B> all specifically refer to three-dimensional spaces. <I><FONT color=brown>Volume</FONT></I> may be used in indicating the exact amount of cubic space something takes up or the exact quantity needed to fill a container: a room with a <I><FONT color=brown>volume</FONT></I> of a thousand cubic feet; estimating the <I><FONT color=brown>volume</FONT></I> of water needed to fill the pool. It is used also for amplitude of sound and arbitrarily for some other measurements: an increasing <I><FONT color=brown>volume</FONT></I> of trunk calls per annum. By contrast, bulk does not suggest exactness of measure, but does refer to a considerable size that may not be proportionate to its weight: breakfast food packages of deceptive <I><FONT color=brown>bulk</FONT></I>. The word has a special use for indicating a major portion: taking on the <I><FONT color=brown>bulk</FONT></I> of the work himself. In scientific usage, <I><FONT color=brown>mass</FONT></I> refers to a quantification of matter underlying gravity and weight. In ordinary use, the word emphasizes weight, density or quantity, and may specifically suggest a large <I><FONT color=brown>bulk</FONT></I> of uneven outline: <I><FONT color=brown>masses</FONT></I> of debris left from the explosion. Less specifically, it may suggest a great amount: a <I><FONT color=brown>mass</FONT></I> of exam papers to correct and mark.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Extent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scope</FONT></B> both may be used to indicate linear or plane distances like <I><FONT color=brown>area</FONT></I> or more generally to indicate degree. In surface measurement, <I><FONT color=brown>extent</FONT></I> suggests an effort to determine the distance something reaches to, especially a linear distance that is subject to change: estimating the <I><FONT color=brown>extent</FONT></I> of river made brackish by the backing up of salt water from the ocean; reports on the <I><FONT color=brown>extent</FONT></I> of the newly captured territory. Used to indicate degree, it is more flexible in application but less specific in meaning, only vaguely suggesting a metaphor of physical penetration: the <I><FONT color=brown>extent</FONT></I> to which he had made a study of structural grammar. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>extent</FONT></I> implies a linear distance, <I><FONT color=brown>scope</FONT></I> implies a two-dimensional area that something has mastered or controls: bulletins on the <I><FONT color=brown>scope</FONT></I> of the flood’s destructiveness. Much more commonly, <I><FONT color=brown>scope</FONT></I> is used figuratively to indicate degree of mastery or breadth of concern: a book of immense-range and <I><FONT color=brown>scope</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>extent</FONT></I> of his reach; the <I><FONT color=brown>scope</FONT></I> of his mind.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boundary">BOUNDARY</A>, <A href="entry://Part">PART</A>, <A href="entry://Section">SECTION</A>, <A href="entry://Site">SITE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to ability that may be the result of training, talent, perceptivity or a combination of some or all of these qualities. <B><FONT color=blue>Skill</FONT></B> is the least formal of these, the most general and the most clear-cut in reference. It may refer, most simply, to relatively commonplace abilities gained largely through training: <I><FONT color=brown>skill</FONT></I> at taking dictation. But it may refer also to ability that training alone could not account for without considerable natural talent: the <I><FONT color=brown>skill</FONT></I> of the prima ballerina. Even in this situation, the word would suggest a necessary adjunct of artistic accomplishment rather than its life-blood. With <B><FONT color=blue>artistry</FONT></B>, the situation is quite the reverse. Here all the imponderables that go into exquisite performance and accomplishment are indicated, and, while training, talent and taste play their part, they work in concert with other less common qualities: the <I><FONT color=brown>artistry</FONT></I> of a great violinist. Because of the strong praise conferred by the word, it is often used hyperbolically of non-artistic acts to suggest how creatively even a seemingly mechanical task may be approached: the <I><FONT color=brown>artistry</FONT></I> with which the waiter tossed the salad.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deftness</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>adroitness</FONT></B> are much nearer <I><FONT color=brown>skill</FONT></I> than <I><FONT color=brown>artistry</FONT></I> in their implications. <I><FONT color=brown>Deftness</FONT></I> may suggest simple manual dexterity when this natural ability has been highly trained: her <I><FONT color=brown>deftness</FONT></I> in handling the complicated tabulator. Less concretely, it can suggest a trained ability to handle any sort of difficult situation: the <I><FONT color=brown>deftness</FONT></I> of a good diplomat in avoiding embarrassing incidents. <I><FONT color=brown>Adroitness</FONT></I> also may pertain to <I><FONT color=brown>skill</FONT></I> at physical manipulation, but it is better able than deftness to suggest knowledgeable appropriateness of behaviour in potentially charged situations: the <I><FONT color=brown>adroitness</FONT></I> of a good hostess in turning a conversation away from disagreeable topics. It is more likely than <I><FONT color=brown>deftness</FONT></I> to refer to an artistic act at a higher level than technical <I><FONT color=brown>skill</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>adroitness</FONT></I> with which the author managed the fugal structure of his novel.</P><P>Just as the previous pair are more closely related to skill, so <B><FONT color=blue>finesse</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>flair</FONT></B> are more closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>artistry</FONT></I>, though they suggest aspects of artistry rather than equivalents to it. <I><FONT color=brown>Finesse</FONT></I> pertains to unusually excellent formal technique that joins to ordinary skill such imponderables as exuberance, taste, perceptivity, wit or cleverness: the chess champion’s <I><FONT color=brown>finesse</FONT></I> in both defensive and offensive play. Someone crediting an artist with his quality rather than <I><FONT color=brown>artistry</FONT></I> would be suggesting a lack of emotional depth or maturity: the flawless but shallow <I><FONT color=brown>finesse</FONT></I> of the young pianist. <I><FONT color=brown>Flair</FONT></I> is the one word here that need not suggest thorough training; what it points to instead is a natural talent that is surprising in its forcefulness, whimsy, colourfulness or vivacity: a <I><FONT color=brown>flair</FONT></I> for watercolours that is all the more impressive considering his lack of experience in the medium. In reference to admittedly trained people, the word can suggest work with zest or dramatic impact that goes beyond mere <I><FONT color=brown>adroitness</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>finesse</FONT></I>: writing with flair despite the rigid limitations of the heroic couplet. Less exaltedly, the word can refer to anything that is very striking about someone’s personal taste: a way of dressing that showed a <I><FONT color=brown>flair</FONT></I> for exploiting bold patterns and colours within the bounds of good taste.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mastery</FONT></B> is ambivalent in that it can apply to simple training, like <I><FONT color=brown>skill</FONT></I>, or to the highest of attainments, like <I><FONT color=brown>artistry</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>mastery</FONT></I> of her job on the assembly line; magnificent murals that are the apex of Michelangelo’s <I><FONT color=brown>mastery</FONT></I> as a painter.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Acumen">ACUMEN</A>, <A href="entry://Attainment">ATTAINMENT</A>, <A href="entry://Genius">GENIUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: clumsiness, incompetence, ineptitude.</P>

<P>These words describe specific types of rapid, energetic motion of people, animals and sometimes inanimate objects. <B><FONT color=blue>Skip</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bound</FONT></B> both emphasize a series of motions. To <I><FONT color=brown>skip</FONT></I> is to move in a sprightly, nimble fashion by stepping, jumping lightly and sliding on each foot in turn. It suggests lightheartedness and is commonly done by children or some young animals: to <I><FONT color=brown>skip</FONT></I> down the street to the sweet shop; goats <I><FONT color=brown>skipping</FONT></I> across the pasture. <I><FONT color=brown>Skip</FONT></I> is used also as a transitive verb to describe light, bouncing motions, especially across a surface: to <I><FONT color=brown>skip</FONT></I> a flat stone on the surface of the water.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Bound</FONT></I> describes a more energetic motion than skip and involves longer and more rapid strides. <I><FONT color=brown>Bound</FONT></I> suggests high spirits and excitement: boys <I><FONT color=brown>bounding</FONT></I> down the beach after a ball; to <I><FONT color=brown>bound</FONT></I> across the room to answer the telephone. <I><FONT color=brown>Bound</FONT></I> may also imply fear or urgency: As we came near the scrub, a startled wallaby <I><FONT color=brown>bounded</FONT></I> across the road.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Leap</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>spring</FONT></B> are closely related in meaning and are more precise than <I><FONT color=brown>bound</FONT></I> in that both involve rising and projecting oneself suddenly and vigorously upwards from the ground or other supporting surface and then darting forwards: to <I><FONT color=brown>leap</FONT></I> over a gate; to <I><FONT color=brown>spring</FONT></I> out of bed. Usually, <I><FONT color=brown>spring</FONT></I> indicates a more vigorous and catapulting motion than <I><FONT color=brown>leap</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Spring</FONT></I> is used also in describing the sudden elastic or recoiling action of certain devices.

<P>These terms refer to congeries of specialized and non-standard words and expressions used by a subculture or subdivision within a larger group sharing a common language, especially when such expressions would be thought illiterate, odd or unintelligible by the average user of the language. <B><FONT color=blue>Slang</FONT></B> refers to the extremely informal language used by the members of an in-group in place of more usual expressions; <I><FONT color=brown>slang</FONT></I> may include abbreviated or made-up words, novel expressions, grammatical distortions and other violations or departures from accepted usage.

<B><FONT color=blue>slave</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bondmaid</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bondman</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>peon</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>serf</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>thrall</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>vassal</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to someone deprived of liberty, serving involuntarily or otherwise at the mercy of a master. <B><FONT color=blue>Slave</FONT></B> is the most common of these, the one with the widest range of uses. Specifically, it refers to someone who is owned by another and has no civil rights himself, particularly someone who serves involuntarily or is given no remuneration for his services. Most countries now prohibit the possession of <I><FONT color=brown>slaves</FONT></I>, a practice endemic throughout history, as in the case of conquerors who commonly made <I><FONT color=brown>slaves</FONT></I> of conquered peoples. Trade in <I><FONT color=brown>slaves</FONT></I> still persists in such places as Africa and the Middle East. In a more general sense, the word is often used today in informal speech to refer to anyone victimized by someone or something: a paternalistic company that not only expected its employees to work like <I><FONT color=brown>slaves</FONT></I>, but to be grateful for the chance; a <I><FONT color=brown>slave</FONT></I> to her own narrow egotism.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bondman</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bondmaid</FONT></B> are now archaic except in a historical context; they refer to a man or woman bound to serve without wages. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>slave</FONT></I>, these words could suggest a contractual agreement which might last for a certain term only and in which a degree of freedom was permitted to the <I><FONT color=brown>bondman</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>bondmaid</FONT></I>. On the literal level, <B><FONT color=blue>thrall</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vassal</FONT></B> are also archaic, but, unlike the previous pair, both have surviving figurative uses. Thrall once indicated someone bound to personal service in a household; <I><FONT color=brown>vassal</FONT></I>, by contrast, indicated someone who was the master of his own affairs but pledged to serve his lord in was in exchange for protection within the lord’s domain. Thus, in its literal historical meaning, <I><FONT color=brown>vassal</FONT></I> contrasts sharply with these other words, since it could apply to people of any intermediate rank between the <I><FONT color=brown>slave</FONT></I> and the absolute master: barons who rebelled against being kept as <I><FONT color=brown>vassals</FONT></I> to their king. Because of legends in which the use of black magic could make one an unwilling <I><FONT color=brown>thrall</FONT></I> to an evil person, the word can suggest figurative enchantment, particularly a state of involuntary fascination: held in <I><FONT color=brown>thrall</FONT></I> by the exquisite music. <I><FONT color=brown>Vassal</FONT></I>, by comparison, is more often used to refer to any kind of forced allegiance or dependency: Iron Curtain countries that are no longer strict <I><FONT color=brown>vassals</FONT></I> of the Soviet Union.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Serf</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>bondman</FONT></I>, is now mostly archaic except in historical reference. Under feudalism, a <I><FONT color=brown>serf</FONT></I> was bound to an estate and could not leave it; whoever owned the land was perforce his master. Nevertheless the <I><FONT color=brown>serf</FONT></I> did have rights, unlike the <I><FONT color=brown>slave</FONT></I>, in that no one could drive him from the land or deny his right to be there. <I><FONT color=brown>Serf</FONT></I> can be used loosely for anyone in servile subjection, but this use can sound imprecise or far-fetched. In Latin America, <B><FONT color=blue>peon</FONT></B> once referred most specifically to someone held in involuntary servitude until he had paid a debt. Since this arrangement often proved permanent in practice, the word now refers to anyone so ridden by poverty as to be virtually a <I><FONT color=brown>serf</FONT></I>, or loosely, to any poorly paid labourer.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Boss">BOSS</A>, lord.</P>

<P>These words indicate a failure to pay the proper attention or respect to something. <B><FONT color=blue>Slight</FONT></B> makes the failure a matter of degree; the word suggests that whatever attention or respect has been given is totally inadequate to the situation at hand: deliberately <I><FONT color=brown>slighting</FONT></I> the ambassador by placing him at the far end of the table. <B><FONT color=blue>Snub</FONT></B> is more restricted in emphasizing that aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>slight</FONT></I> that pertains exclusively to manners and propriety; in this case the lack of respect is unsubtle and overt rather than implied. It also usually suggests a single, dramatic action rather than a gradual process of attrition: deliberately <I><FONT color=brown>snubbing</FONT></I> him by turning and walking away in the middle of his sentence. <B><FONT color=blue>Cut</FONT></B> is very similar to snub except that it usually involves no initial contact or communication at all: When she met me in the street she <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> me dead by looking in another direction. Whether or not a person has been <I><FONT color=brown>slighted</FONT></I> may be a matter of interpretation; there can be no doubt about someone’s having been <I><FONT color=brown>snubbed</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Neglect</FONT></B> is mainly restricted to that aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>slight</FONT></I> that suggests an inequitable division of attention, except that in this case the amount of attention given is even less than is true for <I><FONT color=brown>slight</FONT></I>. The word may suggest either an intentional or unintentional failure of attention, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>slight</FONT></I> and especially <I><FONT color=brown>snub</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I>, where the failure is most clearly conscious and deliberate: a research project that caused him not merely to treat his student casually but to <I><FONT color=brown>neglect</FONT></I> them altogether in his usual absentminded way. <I><FONT color=brown>Neglect</FONT></I> in its very generality can apply also to situations where courtesy or propriety is the issue: a hostess who never <I><FONT color=brown>neglects</FONT></I> the slightest expression of uneasiness on the part of any of her guests.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disregard</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ignore</FONT></B> are like <I><FONT color=brown>neglect</FONT></I> in applying to the more general context of failures in attention, but both words suggest a complete-failure rather than a partial one. In this case, <I><FONT color=brown>ignore</FONT></I> particularly stresses an intentional refusal to take account of a warning: <I><FONT color=brown>ignoring</FONT></I> the detour signs until he pulled up at the wrecked bridge. <I><FONT color=brown>Disregard</FONT></I> implies a denial of attention to something because of superior knowledge or more pressing considerations: asking the jurors to <I><FONT color=brown>disregard</FONT></I> her evidence as false and contradictory. While <I><FONT color=brown>ignore</FONT></I> suggests that something has been rejected without any conscious consideration, <I><FONT color=brown>disregard</FONT></I> can suggest a careful, wholly conscious evaluation that results in dismissal: eager to show that however he might <I><FONT color=brown>disregard</FONT></I> her advice, he would never <I><FONT color=brown>ignore</FONT></I> it. When these two words apply to manners, <I><FONT color=brown>ignore</FONT></I> compares with snub in stressing deliberate act, <I><FONT color=brown>ignore</FONT></I> refers to the omission of even minimal courtesies: <I><FONT color=brown>ignoring</FONT></I> the guest of honour all evening. In this context, <I><FONT color=brown>disregard</FONT></I> her public outburst as inconsequential and unworthy of an answer.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Contemptuous">CONTEMPTUOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Despise">DESPISE</A>, <A href="entry://Forget">FORGET</A>, <A href="entry://Neglect">NEGLECT</A>, <A href="entry://Scoff">SCOFF</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: attend, cherish, consider, heed, prize, tend, value.</P>

<P>These words all designate forms of advertising, the notices or announcements which direct the attention of the public to a product, brand, institution or service. <B><FONT color=blue>Slogan</FONT></B> refers in advertising parlance to some striking phrase designed to catch the eye or ear and to linger as a reminder of a product, service, etc. <I><FONT color=brown>Slogans</FONT></I> are probably the kind of advertisement with which we are all most familiar because constant repetition is the technique used to fix a <I><FONT color=brown>slogan</FONT></I> in the memory.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Message</FONT></B> is the most general term in this list, denoting any group of words used by an advertiser to sell or promote something: "And now, a brief <I><FONT color=brown>message</FONT></I> from our sponsor," are familiar words to radio and television listeners everywhere. A <B><FONT color=blue>cry</FONT></B> is the oldest kind of advertisement under discussion. It designates the words, and hence the <I><FONT color=brown>message</FONT></I>, used by a vendor in announcing his wares: the <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I> of the rabbit-seller in the street. Once a colourful and important selling technique, the <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I> has been all but totally displaced by modern methods of advertising and merchandising.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Commercial</FONT></B> is the general term for any advertising <I><FONT color=brown>message</FONT></I> that is broadcast during a radio or television programme or between programmes.

<P>These words refer to extremely dull, unresponsive dull, unresponsive or inactive states due to laziness, sluggish health or mental depression. Classically one of the seven deadly sins, <B><FONT color=blue>sloth</FONT></B> stresses extreme inaction due to laziness, a state amenable to a simple effort of the will. The word is sharp in its disapproval and suggests the unpleasant concomitants of sloppiness, untidiness or uncleanliness: filthy, dishevelled rooms that gave eloquent testimony to his life of <I><FONT color=brown>sloth</FONT></I> and debauchery. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>sloth</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>torpor</FONT></B> may be applied to animals, people or in fact to anything lying quiescent. Also, the word does not necessarily suggest a voluntary condition and is consequently less disapproving. <I><FONT color=brown>Torpor</FONT></I> does point to a more lasting or deep-seated state near to that of sleep or hibernation and may suggest an unbroken outward uneventfulness: a <I><FONT color=brown>torpor</FONT></I> in which he merely stared out the window for days on end.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Accidie</FONT></B> (or <B><FONT color=blue>acedia</FONT></B>), now obsolete, once added to the connotations of the previous pair the suggestion of a state of mental unresponsiveness. <I><FONT color=brown>Accidie</FONT></I> sometimes replaced <I><FONT color=brown>sloth</FONT></I> in lists of the seven deadly sins, but the word became more widely thought of as referring to a state of mental depression, implying a despair so profound that no action or attitude is thought possible or desirable. <B><FONT color=blue>Apathy</FONT></B> is a much more informal substitute for this use, suggesting emotionless unresponsiveness that may stem from discouragement or low morale: looking upon his parents?quarrels with growing pessimism and <I><FONT color=brown>apathy</FONT></I>. Often the word is used sociologically to refer to a limp, passive attitude towards injustice among groups of people: slum children who face their constricted future with understandable <I><FONT color=brown>apathy</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>apathy</FONT></I> of the German middle classes when faced with the rise of Hitler.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Anomie</FONT></B> is specifically used in a sociological context to refer to a widespread social <I><FONT color=brown>apathy</FONT></I> that results in alienation, breakdowns in communication, hostility and the weakening of norms of conduct: the new delinquency among children of well-to-do parents, reflecting a wide-spread <I><FONT color=brown>anomie</FONT></I> among the affluent. Sometimes the word can suggest a breakdown of norms that sets the stage for chaotic or anarchic violence; in this sense, its suggestion of action puts it in sharp contrast with the other words here. By comparison, the more general <B><FONT color=blue>indolence</FONT></B> is limited to no particular technical context, and refers strictly to an aversion to exertion or work. While this could conceivably give the word a sociological context, more often it is used as a more formal substitute for simple laziness, emphasizing a deliberately chosen state of inactivity: the pampered <I><FONT color=brown>indolence</FONT></I> of the Edwardian gentry. But the word need not always be disapproving: a glorious week of <I><FONT color=brown>indolence</FONT></I> at the beach.</P><P>The remaining pair of words are both highly formal and technical terms from psychiatry. Both describe extremely withdrawn states of mental unresponsiveness. <B><FONT color=blue>Autism</FONT></B> at its most general can indicate a tendency towards daydreaming and introspection; at its most concrete it is used specifically to describe an extreme withdrawal in children that retards or destroys the development of such normal functions as speech: the years of intensive face-to-face effort involved in curing a single case of <I><FONT color=brown>autism</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Catatonia</FONT></B> indicates a similar kind of extreme withdrawal in schizophrenic adults in which the psychosis takes the from of <I><FONT color=brown>apathy</FONT></I>, complete passivity and inability to initiate the simplest actions: patients who, afflicted with <I><FONT color=brown>catatonia</FONT></I>, sit in the same uncomfortable positions for hours rather than shifting to a more comfortable posture.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Impassive">IMPASSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Listless">LISTLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Uninvolved">UNINVOLVED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: activity, concern, diligence, industriousness, interest, involvement, liveliness.</P>

<P>These words refer to people or things of relatively reduced dimensions. <B><FONT color=blue>Small</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>little</FONT></B> are the most general and informal of these words. Both may be used loosely and interchangeably, but <I><FONT color=brown>little</FONT></I> without doubt suggests the most extreme departure from a norm: a <I><FONT color=brown>small</FONT></I> man; a <I><FONT color=brown>little</FONT></I> man. <I><FONT color=brown>Small</FONT></I> may suggest a slight reduction of proportions that is noticeable but not necessarily objectionable: a <I><FONT color=brown>small</FONT></I> house that would do perfectly for the two of them. <I><FONT color=brown>Little</FONT></I>, by contrast, suggests a reduction in scale that may be drastic: a <I><FONT color=brown>little</FONT></I> doll’s hose. <I><FONT color=brown>Small</FONT></I> may be used figuratively to indicate a pettiness in outlook or attitude: What a <I><FONT color=brown>small</FONT></I>-minded person he is.</P><P>When <I><FONT color=brown>small</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>little</FONT></I> refer to the physical proportions of a person, they suggest an overall reduction of scale, with <I><FONT color=brown>little</FONT></I> the most extreme. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>short</FONT></B> is restricted to a reduction in the scale of normal physical height: the <I><FONT color=brown>shortest</FONT></I> boy in the class; a man who appeared to be <I><FONT color=brown>shorter</FONT></I> than he actually was when he stood beside his tall wife. In this sense <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I> may be applied also to parts of a human or animal body: a dwarf with <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I> arms and legs attached to a trunk of normal size; The zebra has a <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I> neck compared with that of the giraffe. In reference to things, <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I> is applied to that which has relatively little linear extension or vertical length: a <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I>, dead-end street containing three houses; skirts that could not possibly be <I><FONT color=brown>shorter</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Short</FONT></I> may also emphasize that something does not measure up to a standard or need in some way: a rope that was too <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I> to reach from one bank of the stream to the other; cheating by playing with a <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I> pack of cards. <B><FONT color=blue>Squat</FONT></B> is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>short</FONT></I>, referring particularly to something that is of reduced vertical height but is not comparably reduced in its other dimensions, giving a low, wide silhouette: Romanesque churches, that look <I><FONT color=brown>squat</FONT></I> beside their soaring Gothic counterparts; a heavy, <I><FONT color=brown>squat</FONT></I> man who waddled along.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Diminutive</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>petite</FONT></B> are intensifications of the meanings implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>small</FONT></I>. Both are much more formal and both are particularly used to refer to women’s figures when they are pleasingly trim and compact: a shortage of <I><FONT color=brown>petite</FONT></I> sizes in day dresses; showing off the diminutive figure she had earned by dieting. While <I><FONT color=brown>petite</FONT></I> would seem affected when applied to things other than women’s figures, <I><FONT color=brown>diminutive</FONT></I> can be used for anything or reduced overall proportions: <I><FONT color=brown>diminutive</FONT></I> apples.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tiny</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wee</FONT></B> are intensifications of <I><FONT color=brown>little</FONT></I>, suggesting such a drastic reduction of scale as to put the thing described outside established norms. <I><FONT color=brown>Tiny</FONT></I> may suggest a miniature or model of something: <I><FONT color=brown>tiny</FONT></I> toy soldiers that were exquisitely carved. In another use, the word can more simply express surprise at something extremely <I><FONT color=brown>small</FONT></I>, even when this is its normal size: a <I><FONT color=brown>tiny</FONT></I> baby; a <I><FONT color=brown>tiny</FONT></I> insect that lit on the palm of her hand. <I><FONT color=brown>Wee</FONT></I> almost inevitably sounds precious or "cute," except possibly in children’s literature: a <I><FONT color=brown>wee</FONT></I> lamb; a <I><FONT color=brown>wee</FONT></I> elf. Used euphemistically by adults, it suggests a humorous intent: wondering if they might have a <I><FONT color=brown>wee</FONT></I> drink, just the two of them, before going on to the party.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compact">COMPACT</A>, <A href="entry://Minute">MINUTE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://High">HIGH</A>, <A href="entry://Large">LARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Massive">MASSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Tremendous">TREMENDOUS</A>.</P>

<P>These nouns denote that which is perceived through the nose by means of the olfactory sense. <B><FONT color=blue>Smell</FONT></B> is the most general word, including all the rest, and <B><FONT color=blue>odour</FONT></B> is its closest synonym. These two words are often used interchangeably, and both may be applied to pleasant, unpleasant or neutral sensations. But <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> is the more nearly neutral word, being freer of connotations than <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> and better suited to scientific contexts. <I><FONT color=brown>Odour</FONT></I> tends to take its character from the words that qualify it: a pungent <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I>; a foul <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Smell</FONT></I> has a character of its own ?a simple, hearty, forthright quality better suited to the kitchen than to the laboratory: cooking <I><FONT color=brown>smells</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Odour</FONT></I> may sometimes signify a more delicately pleasing perception than <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I>: the clean <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> of soap; the spicy <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> of incense. And whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> may sometimes be a blend of separate emanations, an <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> is more commonly traceable to a single source: the <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> of the sick room; the <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> of formaldehyde.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>aroma</FONT></B> is an <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> both pleasing and distinctive, such as that given off by an appetizing food as it cooks or by good pipe tobacco as it burns. An <I><FONT color=brown>aroma</FONT></I> may be savoury or smoky, permeating the air, or it may be delicate or spicy; but it is always stimulating to the senses: the <I><FONT color=brown>aroma</FONT></I> of fresh coffee. <B><FONT color=blue>Bouquet</FONT></B> is applied primarily to the delicate <I><FONT color=brown>aroma</FONT></I> that distinguishes a fine wine: He lifted the wine glass and sniffed the <I><FONT color=brown>bouquet</FONT></I> appreciatively.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>scent</FONT></B> is any <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I>, natural or artificial, that is or may be faintly diffused through the air. A <I><FONT color=brown>scent</FONT></I> is always delicate and often pleasing: the <I><FONT color=brown>scent</FONT></I> of a sachet. <B><FONT color=blue>Perfume</FONT></B> is the same as <I><FONT color=brown>scent</FONT></I> except that it has more elegance, and so is synonymous with <B><FONT color=blue>fragrance</FONT></B>, which is a sweeter, fresher, more pervasive <I><FONT color=brown>scent</FONT></I>: the lingering <I><FONT color=brown>fragrance</FONT></I> of lilacs. <I><FONT color=brown>Scent</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>perfume</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fragrance</FONT></I> are the words properly applied to dusting powder and other toiletries. <I><FONT color=brown>Smell</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> seem inelegant and inappropriate in such contexts, except when <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> is used with simple sincerity, as by a child: He liked the <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> of his mother’s talcum powder.</P><P>Applied to the natural emanations of human beings, <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> often signify something unpleasant or offensive, though the words are not limited in this way: the <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> of sweat; <I><FONT color=brown>body</FONT></I> odour. <B><FONT color=blue>Fragrance</FONT></B> is used only of women and often occurs in popular writing, connoting a fresh, clean <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>fragrance</FONT></I> of her hair. <I><FONT color=brown>Scent</FONT></I> denotes the characteristic odour of an animal ?a faint residual <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> that lingers along the ground over which the animal has passed. A natural human <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> is referred to as a <I><FONT color=brown>scent</FONT></I> only when the person in question is being tracked down like an animal: Bloodhounds followed the <I><FONT color=brown>scent</FONT></I> of the escaped prisoner. <I><FONT color=brown>Scent</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> may also denote the olfactory sense itself; but <I><FONT color=brown>scent</FONT></I> is usually reserved for animals, especially dogs, and suggests an unusually sharp sense of <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I>: the keen <I><FONT color=brown>scent</FONT></I> of the foxhound.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stink</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stench</FONT></B> are strong words and are applied to foul, offensive <I><FONT color=brown>odours</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>smells</FONT></I> that make a person hold his nose or that turn him sick to the stomach. Of the two, stink suggests a sharper sensation; <I><FONT color=brown>stench</FONT></I>, a more sickening one: the <I><FONT color=brown>stink</FONT></I> of sweaty feet; the <I><FONT color=brown>stench</FONT></I> of gangrene. Both words apply to what is rotting or decaying, but <I><FONT color=brown>stench</FONT></I> denotes the stronger and more overpowering <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>stench</FONT></I> of a battlefield after a slaughter.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Bouquet</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>stench</FONT></I>, being the most specific of these words, are seldom used figuratively. But <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>stink</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> are often so used. [There was an <I><FONT color=brown>odour</FONT></I> of fear in the air; He made quite a <I><FONT color=brown>stink</FONT></I> about it; It had the <I><FONT color=brown>smell</FONT></I> of foul play.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Savoury">SAVOURY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a facial expression in which the mouth is silently widened and its corners are upturned in order to convey such emotions as affection, amusement, confidence, irony, polite approval or disdain. <B><FONT color=blue>Smile</FONT></B> is the most general here, referring to any such expression regardless of the emotion being conveyed: giving the child a tender <I><FONT color=brown>smile</FONT></I>; swaggering down the street with a bright <I><FONT color=brown>smile</FONT></I>; unable to suppress a <I><FONT color=brown>smile</FONT></I> at his naïveté; the bitter <I><FONT color=brown>smile</FONT></I> he wore during his opponent’s rebuttal. Because the expression itself suggests pleasure or approval more readily than other emotions, the word can even refer to the stereotyped mannerism that is put on automatically for other people in the absence of sincere emotion of any sort: the maddening and invariable <I><FONT color=brown>smile</FONT></I> that some air hostesses wear in response to every request or complaint.</P><P>The remaining words restrict themselves in reference to particular emotions or situations that motivate the <I><FONT color=brown>smile</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Grin</FONT></B> indicates a greater widening of the mouth than <I><FONT color=brown>smile</FONT></I>, especially one that exposes the teeth, and suggests spontaneity, greater emotional intensity, and implies friendly warmth, pleasure, mirth or high-spirited amusement: giving her his best devil-may-care <I><FONT color=brown>grin</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>grin</FONT></I> with which she greeted her old school-friend. The word is derived from a root referring to howling or groaning, and the word is sometimes used for a less amicable or even ferocious baring of the teeth; the <I><FONT color=brown>grin</FONT></I> of a snarling wolf; the wounded soldier’s <I><FONT color=brown>grin</FONT></I> of pain. In this use, the word may be a colourful substitute for grimace, which is more precise.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Simper</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>smirk</FONT></B> are sometimes equated as indicating the same sort of silly or fatuous expression, but strikingly different connotations surround each word. <I><FONT color=brown>Simper</FONT></I> suggests smugness and self-righteousness and may even imply primness: the Wife of Bath’s complaisant <I><FONT color=brown>simper</FONT></I>; a sort of mutual admiration society in which they could exchange simpers of superiority as they faced the uninitiated. <I><FONT color=brown>Smirk</FONT></I> may be used with precisely these same overtones. But where <I><FONT color=brown>simper</FONT></I> may suggest the reflection of an abiding self-consciousness and inward feeling of hypocritical superiority, <I><FONT color=brown>smirk</FONT></I> suggests more often a momentary outward expression of derision or hostility: a teacher who tricks his students into giving incorrect answers and then greets them with a <I><FONT color=brown>smirk</FONT></I>; a man in handcuffs regarding his captors with a <I><FONT color=brown>smirk</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Leer</FONT></B> is a more forceful word than <I><FONT color=brown>smirk</FONT></I> and suggests a glance and <I><FONT color=brown>grin</FONT></I> showing cunning, viciousness or lasciviousness: slouched against the wall <I><FONT color=brown>leering</FONT></I> at unescorted girls.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Laugh">LAUGH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Frown">FROWN</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>smutty</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bawdy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pornographic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ribald</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the expression or representation of sexual desire or lust. <B><FONT color=blue>Smutty</FONT></B> is the informal and <B><FONT color=blue>pornographic</FONT></B> the formal word for frank allusions to or portrayals of sexual acts. Both can refer disapprovingly to literature or art preoccupied with this subject matter: a <I><FONT color=brown>smutty</FONT></I> series of drawings; a <I><FONT color=brown>pornographic</FONT></I> novel; a <I><FONT color=brown>smutty</FONT></I> film. Both words imply work designed to invoke a leer or outright sexual arousal, often of a neurotic kind. <I><FONT color=brown>Smutty</FONT></I> is more general and more charged with a feeling of abhorrence; it can refer also to suggestive remarks or dirty jokes: He was constantly making <I><FONT color=brown>smutty</FONT></I> comments that embarrassed everyone in the room. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>pornographic</FONT></I> is a more technical term referring strictly to literary, art or photographic work. The word suggests something that has no redeeming social or artistic worth and is designed to arouse prurient feelings in the average person.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bawdy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ribald</FONT></B> may once have been as condemnatory as the foregoing, though they have always applied more widely to actions as well as to works or remarks. Now both may sometimes be used to characterize sexual behaviour or references that are frank or earthy, but not necessarily <I><FONT color=brown>smutty</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Bawdy</FONT></I> derives from a word referring to a procurer or prostitute, as can still be seen in the phrase, <I><FONT color=brown>bawdy</FONT></I> house. But the word refers more widely to sexual behaviour that is exuberant, lively, riotous or promiscuous: a <I><FONT color=brown>bawdy</FONT></I> novel about Elizabethan England; a <I><FONT color=brown>bawdy</FONT></I> brawling, amoral hulk of a man. While bawdy may suggest good humour, <I><FONT color=brown>ribald</FONT></I> specifically stresses an approach to sexuality that is both comic and <I><FONT color=brown>bawdy</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>ribald</FONT></I> stories in Balzac’s <I><FONT color=brown>Droll Tales</FONT></I>. In reference to behaviour, the word adds a note of with or merriment: a <I><FONT color=brown>ribald</FONT></I> party thrown by the jet set, at which strip-tease films were shown in mixed company.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A>, <A href="entry://Erotic">EROTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Lewd">LEWD</A>, <A href="entry://Suggestive">SUGGESTIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bland">BLAND</A>, bowdlerized, euphemistic, genteel, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words pertain to various political theories that propose the government ownership of a country’s means of production. <B><FONT color=blue>Socialism</FONT></B>, in its generic sense, is a term of neutral force under which to group all such philosophies, but the word is blurred at the outset in that the adherents of many of these systems will argue that only their particular philosophy is the "true" <I><FONT color=brown>socialism</FONT></I>. On the other hand, advocates of an opposing economic system, capitalism, use the word socialism in an equally inexact way ?as a general term of a nation’s economic life.</P><P>Political scientists, in attempting to keep the word useful as a neutral term of description, must cope also with the fact that socialism has been used to describe both democratic and totalitarian systems. The first of these uses applies to the politico-economic systems of such countries as Australia, Britain, New Zealand, Sweden, etc., in which democratic elective processes are combined with government welfare programmes and government control or ownership of selected industries. This specific meaning of socialism (often called democratic socialism) is brought into play as a means of contrasting these countries with those commonly thought of as communist and in which free, elective representative government is not maintained.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Collectivism</FONT></B> is a generic term that is useful because it does not contain the ambiguities inherent in the word <I><FONT color=brown>socialism</FONT></I>. It refers, not to a particular systematic ideology, but rather to any tendency towards the centralizing or power in the hands of a controlling bureaucracy. It can be applied with equal accuracy to any nation with a strong central government, whether democratic or totalitarian, capitalist or socialist. It is often used to the socialistic tendencies of any government ?in which case the word carries an overtone of disapproval: The century saw the rise of <I><FONT color=brown>collectivism</FONT></I> in all its various forms, with a corresponding decline in the importance put upon the worth of the individual.</P><P>All the remaining terms pertain to a particular kind of <B><FONT color=blue>communism</FONT></B>. This term itself, while the most general, is least open to a precise definition because of its constant redefinition by propagandists of all persuasions. Karl Marx and others founded <B><FONT color=blue>Marxism</FONT></B>, which advocated seizures of power by workers in violent revolution. Marx predicted that after this seizure the state would "wither away," leaving a perfect, classless society. Until this condition of ideal <I><FONT color=brown>communism</FONT></I> could be reached, post-revolutionary man would approach it through the institution of a proletarian, socialist dictatorship. Because <I><FONT color=brown>communism</FONT></I> is imagined as a future perfection, some communists call their present system <I><FONT color=brown>socialism</FONT></I>, causing much confusion to those not acquainted with Marx’s apocalyptic prophecies.</P><P>Nikolai Lenin, the first revolutionary leader of the Soviet Union, made basic changes in <I><FONT color=brown>Marxism</FONT></I> that gave rise to <B><FONT color=blue>Leninism</FONT></B>, or <I><FONT color=brown>Marxist-Leninism</FONT></I> as it is sometimes called. He attempted to explain why the communist revolution had succeeded first in a backward country like Russia rather than, as Marx had predicted, in one of the most developed capitalist countries. Stalin subsequently developed this argument in a strongly rationalistic direction, proposing that the interests of the Soviet state should take priority over the task of fostering revolutions in other counties. Leon Trosky challenged this position of Stalin’s, giving rise to <B><FONT color=blue>Trotskyism</FONT></B>, which stressed the need for continuous world-wide revolutionary activity. This dispute gave rise to the term revisionism, meaning any departure in ideology from the original tenets of "pure" <I><FONT color=brown>Marxism</FONT></I>. It is still widely used in intro-communist debates to refer to a communist doctrine with which the given writer or speaker does not agree.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Maoism</FONT></B> is used to refer to the most militant present-day version of communism, as espoused by the founder of communist China, Mao Tse-tung. It specifically implies a harsh intransigence in rejecting the possibility of co-existence with capitalistic states: Young radicals seem more attracted to <I><FONT color=brown>Maoism</FONT></I> than to democratic <I><FONT color=brown>socialism</FONT></I> or even the <I><FONT color=brown>Leninism</FONT></I> that has evolved in the Soviet Union.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Castroism</FONT></B> (or sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>Fidelism</FONT></I>) is usually applied to the revolutionary tendency of radicals in Latin America, after Fidel Castro, the leader who established a revolutionary government in Cuba. The word carries no implication as to what brand of <I><FONT color=brown>socialism</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>communism</FONT></I> the revolutionist might prefer: He argued that <I><FONT color=brown>Castroism</FONT></I> could gain no foothold in those countries where genuinely democratic reforms were being made.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anarchism">ANARCHISM</A>, LEFT-WINGER.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: capitalism.</P>

<P>These words mean to make or become unclean, impure or stained with foreign matter. As implying the degree of uncleanness and its undesirability, <B><FONT color=blue>soil</FONT></B> is somewhat milder than <B><FONT color=blue>dirty</FONT></B> and refers largely to the inevitable staining with dust and grime, especially of clothing and linen, that occurs from ordinary use: to <I><FONT color=brown>soil</FONT></I> a towel by not thoroughly washing one’s <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> hands; a shirt collar <I><FONT color=brown>soiled</FONT></I> with sweat. In this context <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> is often substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>soil</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> usually suggests creating an unclean condition that not only offends the aesthetic sense but may be injurious to health. Something that has been <I><FONT color=brown>soiled</FONT></I>, though <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> is now generally restricted to domestic uses: Don’t <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> the floor!; He will <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> the sofa if he puts his muddy shoes on it.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Smudge</FONT></B> means to soil literally by begriming, as with soot, or by smearing, as with ink or dirty fingers. It often implies a degree of uncleanness as mild as, or milder than, that implied by <I><FONT color=brown>soil</FONT></I>, and suggests not making something <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> as much as it does spotting or staining it: Be careful not to <I><FONT color=brown>smudge</FONT></I> the drawing.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Dirty</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>soil</FONT></I> are sometimes used figuratively in the moral context of character assassination: to <I><FONT color=brown>soil</FONT></I> a young girl’s spotless reputation; to <I><FONT color=brown>dirty</FONT></I> an honoured name.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Besmirch</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sully</FONT></B>, now found largely in literature of the past, have virtually lost all their earlier meanings of <I><FONT color=brown>soiling</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>dirtying</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>smudging</FONT></I> in a physical sense. Rather, <I><FONT color=brown>besmirch</FONT></I> is used as meaning to damage or dim the lustre of, as one’s honour or good repute: a reputation undeservedly <I><FONT color=brown>besmirched</FONT></I> by vicious gossip and slander. <I><FONT color=brown>Sully</FONT></I> is used in the same way, but carries a hint of greater injury and condemnation: his fame and standing as a diplomat <I><FONT color=brown>sullied</FONT></I> by the publicizing of his many romances.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Dirty">DIRTY</A> (adj.), <A href="entry://Discolour">DISCOLOUR</A>, <A href="entry://Pollute">POLLUTE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: bleach, <A href="entry://Clean">CLEAN</A>, purify.</P>

<P>These words agree in denoting a troubled state of mind. <B><FONT color=blue>Solicitude</FONT></B>, the most formal term, often implies anxious attention or devotion to another’s welfare: The <I><FONT color=brown>solicitude</FONT></I> shown him by his neighbours after the robbery touched him deeply. <I><FONT color=brown>Solicitude</FONT></I> is especially used when the involvement of others is disinterested, stemming from feelings of charity or brotherhood rather than from intimacy or blood relationship: the <I><FONT color=brown>solicitude</FONT></I> of kings over the well-being of their subject.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Care</FONT></B> arises from responsibility or affection for others, and may vary from mild <B><FONT color=blue>concern</FONT></B> to profound <B><FONT color=blue>worry</FONT></B>: <I><FONT color=brown>care</FONT></I> for one’s children. <I><FONT color=brown>Concern</FONT></I> is the absence of indifference, and hence implies voluntary involvement: <I><FONT color=brown>concern</FONT></I> for the nation’s welfare. <I><FONT color=brown>Worry</FONT></I> implies an oppressive and fretful anxiety, and is often needless or excessive: distraught with <I><FONT color=brown>worry</FONT></I> over his daughter’s late hours. <I><FONT color=brown>Worry</FONT></I> is the most personal and most intensely felt of these words, although it is sometimes used of impersonal situations to indicate irrational concern: burdened with all the <I><FONT color=brown>worries</FONT></I> of the world. <I><FONT color=brown>Care</FONT></I> implies an intimate and often deep attachment. <I><FONT color=brown>Concern</FONT></I> is more detached, and may indicate only a formal response to an impersonal situation: The Prime Minister expressed his <I><FONT color=brown>concern</FONT></I> over the threatened postal strike.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>, <A href="entry://Fear">FEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Love">LOVE</A>, <A href="entry://Worry">WORRY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: aloofness, indifference, <A href="entry://Neglect">NEGLECT</A>, unmindfulness.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>solve</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>decipher</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>decode</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unravel</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the working out or making clear of a puzzle or mystery. <B><FONT color=blue>Solve</FONT></B> means to answer a question or work out a problem, often one deliberately set, as an exercise: <I><FONT color=brown>solving</FONT></I> the ten mathematical equations set for homework. The word can refer also to explaining any set of events by finding a workable way of dealing with them or by seeing the deeper meaning behind them: <I><FONT color=brown>solving</FONT></I> the problem of peace through world diplomacy; <I><FONT color=brown>solving</FONT></I> the dilemma of accounting for the national debt by viewing it in terms of the national balance of payments. <B><FONT color=blue>Unravel</FONT></B> functions most nearly like this general sense of <I><FONT color=brown>solve</FONT></I>. The emphasis is on the untangling of a knotty problem, especially by means of research or analysis: an investigating body at work to <I><FONT color=brown>unravel</FONT></I> the motives of the assassin; an essay attempting to <I><FONT color=brown>unravel</FONT></I> the meaning of the difficult poem.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Decipher</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>decode</FONT></B> are alike in specifically referring to the act of making intelligible a message that has been systematically garbled to confuse an unwanted reader: <I><FONT color=brown>deciphering</FONT></I> the radioed messages of the enemy; <I><FONT color=brown>decoding</FONT></I> the message by feeding it through the computer programmed to turn it into English again. In this context, <I><FONT color=brown>decipher</FONT></I> refers to translating messages scrambled according to a key or pre-arranged scheme, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>decode</FONT></I> refers to translating agree-upon symbols that may be arbitrary or random. Thus <I><FONT color=brown>decoding</FONT></I> normally requires a code book in which the plain text and encoded equivalents are listed; <I><FONT color=brown>deciphering</FONT></I> involves only knowledge of the key or system, e.g., 1 for A, 2 for B, etc. <I><FONT color=brown>Decipher</FONT></I> is more often used than <I><FONT color=brown>decode</FONT></I> in a metaphorical way, in which case it refers to explaining puzzling or enigmatic signs: finally <I><FONT color=brown>deciphering</FONT></I> the odd expression he had given her a minute before.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clarify">CLARIFY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: baffle, <A href="entry://Confuse">CONFUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Puzzle">PUZZLE</A>, stump.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>sophistry</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>casuistry</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hair-splitting</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>sophism</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to over-subtle argumentative techniques that place more emphasis on form than content, often with the intent of misleading or deceiving an audience. <B><FONT color=blue>Sophistry</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sophism</FONT></B> both derive from a Greek word for wisdom and relate to the Sophists, a pre-Socratic school of philosophers interested in the logical expression of philosophical truth. In Socrates?day, the name was taken over by paid philosophers who taught logical and rhetorical techniques and were concerned more with persuasive forms of discourse than the search for truth. Thus, both words now indicate false argument intentionally used to deceive. While the difference between the two words is slight, <I><FONT color=brown>sophistry</FONT></I> might be most useful as a generic term, <I><FONT color=brown>sophism</FONT></I> as a reference to specific examples: campaign oratory filled with <I><FONT color=brown>sophistry</FONT></I>; a statement on taxes that was a <I><FONT color=brown>sophism</FONT></I> pure and simple.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Casuistry</FONT></B> has a Christian theological rather than classical Greek background; it refers to the science or doctrine of ambiguous or special cases of conscience, balance against prevailing rules of religion and morality, thus determining questions of moral right and wrong. The reasoning involved in this sort of argument was often so subtle, quibbling and complicated that the word has come to be used with the same pejorative tone that <I><FONT color=brown>sophistry</FONT></I> has acquired. It still applies particularly to disputes about ethics or morals: a politician who has abandoned the <I><FONT color=brown>casuistry</FONT></I> surrounding arguments over capital punishment. <B><FONT color=blue>Hair-splitting</FONT></B> is more specific than these other words in applying to any sort of argumentative discourse in which finicky or petty attention is given to fine points of method or substance in such a way as to lose slight of more significant questions: descending to <I><FONT color=brown>hair-splitting</FONT></I> about side issues whenever his opponent managed to present a convincing statement on the main issue.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Controversy">CONTROVERSY</A>, <A href="entry://Deception">DECEPTION</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to wavering coruscations of light, whether reflected from a moving surface or emitted unsteadily by the source of light itself. <B><FONT color=blue>Sparkling</FONT></B> would seem to suggest the throwing off of sparks, but as now used it is almost exclusively restricted to uneven, bright flashes reflected from light-catching objects: <I><FONT color=brown>sparkling</FONT></I> diamonds. <B><FONT color=blue>Glittering</FONT></B> is close to sparkling in meaning; <I><FONT color=brown>sparkling</FONT></I> perhaps suggests intenser stabs of more fleeting light, while <I><FONT color=brown>glittering</FONT></I> might suggest a larger mass of reflecting material that can be seen over a longer period of time and that casts reflections not so dependent on an exact perspective: a <I><FONT color=brown>sparkling</FONT></I> drop of dew; the whole <I><FONT color=brown>glittering</FONT></I>, rain-washed garden. In more general uses, <I><FONT color=brown>sparkling</FONT></I> suggests exuberance or animation, while <I><FONT color=brown>glittering</FONT></I> may have negative connotations of gaudiness, cheapnee or evil: her <I><FONT color=brown>sparkling</FONT></I> smile; <I><FONT color=brown>glittering</FONT></I> trinkets; <I><FONT color=brown>glittering</FONT></I> generalities; the <I><FONT color=brown>glittering</FONT></I> avarice in his eyes.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Flashing</FONT></B>, when used for sources of light, suggests most strongly regular on-and-off alternation of light and darkness: the <I><FONT color=brown>flashing</FONT></I> red of the level-crossing light. Used for reflected light, it does not suggest regularity so much as intensity; it may not even suggest wavering light at all: the flashing, sunlit windows. Like sparkling, flashing may suggest liveliness, but more often of an unpleasant nature: the <I><FONT color=brown>flashing</FONT></I> eyes of rage. Both <B><FONT color=blue>twinkling</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scintillating</FONT></B> describe, most specifically, starlight that appears to waver because of the moving atmosphere through which we see it. <I><FONT color=brown>Twinkling</FONT></I> can seem coy outside its nursery-rhyme context, but may escape this in descriptive uses: the <I><FONT color=brown>twinkling</FONT></I> lights of the city far below. In an extended use it may describe a quick, short movement or series of movements: the <I><FONT color=brown>twinkling</FONT></I> feet of the tap dancer. <I><FONT color=brown>Scintillating</FONT></I> has overtones of brilliance and has been over-used in figurative contexts to suggest elegance and wit: <I><FONT color=brown>scintillating</FONT></I> conversation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Flickering</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>glimmering</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>shimmering</FONT></B> all suggest a subdued or dim wavering of light. <I><FONT color=brown>Flickering</FONT></I> relates mostly to sources rather than reflections of light, but suggests a more sporadic or irregular wavering than the earlier words: patches of clouds that let through only flickering sunlight. The word has been over-used to describe firelight: <I><FONT color=brown>flickering</FONT></I> logs in the fireplace. <I><FONT color=brown>Shimmering</FONT></I>, in contrast, stresses reflected light that undulates quickly in a soft or dazzling blur: <I><FONT color=brown>shimmering</FONT></I> water. <I><FONT color=brown>Glimmering</FONT></I> may apply either to sources or the reflections; more than either of its two companion words, it stresses fitfulness and dimness, suggesting a source fainter than for <I><FONT color=brown>flickering</FONT></I> and slower undulations than for <I><FONT color=brown>shimmering</FONT></I>: the last coals of the <I><FONT color=brown>glimmering</FONT></I> fire; traces of moonlight in the <I><FONT color=brown>glimmering</FONT></I> darkness of the room.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bright">BRIGHT</A>, <A href="entry://Luminous">LUMINOUS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dull, <A href="entry://Gloomy">GLOOMY</A>, lacklustre.</P>

<P>These words refer to pole-like weapons, usually with pointed heads, that are thrown or used to stab. In a historical context, <B><FONT color=blue>spear</FONT></B> can indicate any weapon of this kind, from the crudest tot he most highly refined; it most readily calls to mind a primitive weapon, such as one made of wood: the Roman soldier who wounded Christ’s side with his <I><FONT color=brown>spear</FONT></I>; photographing a tribal dance of warriors carrying <I><FONT color=brown>spear</FONT></I> and shield. The word still occurs as a term in present-day <I><FONT color=brown>spear</FONT></I> fishing, however, where it indicates a forged, barbed instrument, usually made of steel. <B><FONT color=blue>Lance</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pike</FONT></B> are forms of <I><FONT color=brown>spear</FONT></I> that were outmoded by the development of gunpowder. <I><FONT color=brown>Lance</FONT></I>, as it refers to the medieval weapon, suggests a long heave piece, one used by a mounted soldier to joust with, rather than one designed to be thrown. In the same period, <I><FONT color=brown>pike</FONT></I> indicated a larger, heavier weapon than <I><FONT color=brown>lance</FONT></I>, used by a foot soldier for bludgeoning or stabbing, rather than for throwing or jousting.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Harpoon</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>javelin</FONT></B> both refer to specialized types of <I><FONT color=brown>spears</FONT></I> still in use. <I><FONT color=brown>Harpoon</FONT></I> can refer to a weapon particularly designed for catching fish, whether used as something to be thrown or to stab with. It has long referred to a steel-headed <I><FONT color=brown>spear</FONT></I> hurled to wound or kill such sea animals as whales, and still functions in this context, but now it often refers to any sort of pronged or barbed instrument that may be shot, as from a gun designed for the purpose. In a context similar to that for <I><FONT color=brown>lance</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>pike</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>javelin</FONT></I> once referred to a light weapon for throwing in battle: it survives now to indicate a specially made, long <I><FONT color=brown>spear</FONT></I> that is thrown in athletic events: working out with both the discus and <I><FONT color=brown>javelin</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Arms">ARMS</A>, <A href="entry://Knife">KNIFE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to someone watching any sort of event. <B><FONT color=blue>Spectator</FONT></B> can indicate someone present at a sporting event or other happening; no direct participation is implied, but the word often suggests that a spectator has made the effort to attend or be a member of the audience: <I><FONT color=brown>spectators</FONT></I> at the tennis match; <I><FONT color=brown>spectators</FONT></I> lined up to watch the procession. Less often, the word can suggest the opposite: millions of people who unexpectedly became <I><FONT color=brown>spectators</FONT></I> to the world’s first televised murder. <B><FONT color=blue>Onlooker</FONT></B>, by contrast, more often suggests an accidental or chance viewing of some event: <I><FONT color=brown>onlookers</FONT></I> who happened to be present when the Ferris wheel collapsed. The word may also suggest someone who has deliberately withdrawn from events he might well have participated in: He chose to remain an <I><FONT color=brown>onlooker</FONT></I> during most of his family’s protracted quarrels.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fan</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>barracker</FONT></B> are more informal than the foregoing, but both specifically suggest the interested and voluntary viewing of something. <I><FONT color=brown>Fan</FONT></I> relates to <I><FONT color=brown>spectator</FONT></I> in particularly emphasizing the ardent advocacy of a given artist, performer or team: They performed in a hall that held thousands of screaming <I><FONT color=brown>fans</FONT></I>; booed by <I><FONT color=brown>fans</FONT></I> for the home team. The word need not imply a physical gathering at all: a <I><FONT color=brown>fan</FONT></I> of the prolific mystery writer; a pre-sold market of <I><FONT color=brown>fans</FONT></I> for every new record they made. A <I><FONT color=brown>barracker</FONT></I> is the same as a <I><FONT color=brown>fan</FONT></I>, but, while a <I><FONT color=brown>fan</FONT></I> can be silent, a <I><FONT color=brown>barracker</FONT></I> is one who urges his man or team by loud shouts and cheering, as well as looking on: He was always a <I><FONT color=brown>barracker</FONT></I> for the winning team. In another verbal sense, it can signify a vocal attack: The crowd <I><FONT color=brown>barracked</FONT></I> the opening batsmen for slow play.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Peeping Tom</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>voyeur</FONT></B> refer to onlookers who deliberately spy on others. <I><FONT color=brown>Peeping Tom</FONT></I>, the more informal of the two, may sometimes suggest devious attempt to gain information, but more often it suggests a mentally disturbed person who gets erotic pleasure from spying on unsuspecting people who are not fully dressed: a <I><FONT color=brown>peeping Tom</FONT></I> who kept watch on the bedrooms of the adjacent flats. <I><FONT color=brown>Voyeur</FONT></I> is the technical psychiatric term for such a person, although here the word includes, as well, any sort of erotic pleasure derived from looking rather than active involvement, even where stealth is not present: permissive parents whose open intimacies tend to make <I><FONT color=brown>voyeurs</FONT></I> of their children.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Observer</FONT></B> is uniquely relevant to someone specifically assigned the role of watching rather than participating, particularly someone who remains impartial and has no authority to affect the outcome: U.N. <I><FONT color=brown>observers</FONT></I> deployed as members of the peace-keeping mission in the truce zone. The word can indicate also he role assumed by someone, such as a commentator or critic, who is a perceptive viewer of events and reports them to or analyses them for others: a keen <I><FONT color=brown>observer</FONT></I> of the modern art scene. In this case, it is the <I><FONT color=brown>observer</FONT></I> who may have the audience, whereas the things he reports may not. <B><FONT color=blue>Witness</FONT></B> may suggest accidental viewing, like <I><FONT color=brown>onlooker</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>witness</FONT></I> to the accident. It may also suggest someone who deliberately experiences something in order to report it: a crusading <I><FONT color=brown>witness</FONT></I> to racial injustice. It may, in fact, refer to the report itself; bearing false <I><FONT color=brown>witness</FONT></I>. The word, in the legal context, can refer either to onlookers or anyone else called to give evidence in court or to people called upon to observe and certify a transaction: <I><FONT color=brown>witness</FONT></I> who gave conflicting testimony; needing two <I><FONT color=brown>witness</FONT></I> to make the ceremony legal.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://See">SEE</A>, <A href="entry://Vision">VISION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: participant, <A href="entry://Performer">PERFORMER</A>.</P>

<P>These nouns apply to public speaking, denoting talks delivered before an audience. <B><FONT color=blue>Speech</FONT></B> is the most general and least formal word. A <I><FONT color=brown>speech</FONT></I> may be either extemporaneous or prepared; it may express feelings, ideas or opinions, impart information, related experiences, set forth a programme or outline a position: a campaign <I><FONT color=brown>speech</FONT></I>; a prepared <I><FONT color=brown>speech</FONT></I>; an impromptu <I><FONT color=brown>speech</FONT></I>; an after-dinner <I><FONT color=brown>speech</FONT></I>. An <B><FONT color=blue>address</FONT></B> is a carefully prepared, formal speech; as one delivered by a distinguished speaker or made on a ceremonial occasion: an inaugural <I><FONT color=brown>address</FONT></I>; a graduation <I><FONT color=brown>address</FONT></I>. Also whereas <I><FONT color=brown>speech</FONT></I> emphasizes the act of talking, <I><FONT color=brown>address</FONT></I> stresses the fact that an audience is in attendance: a malcontent making <I><FONT color=brown>speeches</FONT></I> on street corners; the chairman’s annual <I><FONT color=brown>address</FONT></I> to the shareholders.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>oration</FONT></B> is an eloquent <I><FONT color=brown>address</FONT></I> meant to stir the emotions of a group or mass of people. It treats some important subject in a dignified style and manner, according to the rules of oratory, and is usually delivered on a special occasion, as at a celebration or a funeral: Mark Antony’s <I><FONT color=brown>oration</FONT></I> over the body of Caesar; Lincoln’s Gettysburg <I><FONT color=brown>Address</FONT></I> was an <I><FONT color=brown>oration</FONT></I>. Since true orators are rare, the term <I><FONT color=brown>oration</FONT></I> may be applied also to a pompous speech designed for showy, oratorical effect: a small-town Anzac Day <I><FONT color=brown>oration</FONT></I>. A <B><FONT color=blue>harangue</FONT></B> is a long, loud, vehement speech, appealing to passions or prejudices. It may be an extemporaneous tirade and is often intended to inflame those to whom it is addressed and to spur them to action of some sort: the <I><FONT color=brown>harangues</FONT></I> of a demagogue. In a looser sense, <I><FONT color=brown>harangue</FONT></I> may apply to any long, bombastic speech, typically a tiresome one: endless <I><FONT color=brown>harangues</FONT></I>.</P><P>Where <I><FONT color=brown>oration</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>harangue</FONT></I> emphasize the character of an <I><FONT color=brown>address</FONT></I>, the remaining nouns stress content and purpose. A <B><FONT color=blue>discourse</FONT></B> is a fairly long, carefully prepared, well-organized <I><FONT color=brown>speech</FONT></I> on a definite subject: a <I><FONT color=brown>discourse</FONT></I> on Virgil; a collection of religious <I><FONT color=brown>discourse.</FONT></I> A <B><FONT color=blue>lecture</FONT></B> is the kind of <I><FONT color=brown>speech</FONT></I> given by a university teacher to a class. It is a <I><FONT color=brown>discourse</FONT></I> on a given topic, designed to inform and instruct a group of students or some similar audience: a lecture course as distinguished from a series of seminars; adult-education <I><FONT color=brown>lectures</FONT></I> on modern art. <I><FONT color=brown>Lecture</FONT></I> derives from a Latin verb meaning to read. The most effective lectures are not read, but giving a <I><FONT color=brown>lecture</FONT></I> does imply extensive previous preparation, including the writing down of what is to be said.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>sermon</FONT></B> (the general word) and <B><FONT color=blue>homily</FONT></B> (the more erudite term) may mean an instructive religious <I><FONT color=brown>discourse</FONT></I> delivered by a clergyman to a congregation. Originally, a homily was a discourse or lecture explaining a Biblical text, while a <I><FONT color=brown>sermon</FONT></I> was an <I><FONT color=brown>address</FONT></I> from the pulpit dealing with dogma or ethics. Now the opposite distinction is sometimes made ?that a <I><FONT color=brown>sermon</FONT></I> takes its theme from Scripture while a <I><FONT color=brown>homily</FONT></I> gives practical ethical guidance. In the Middle Ages, <I><FONT color=brown>homilies</FONT></I> written by eloquent and learned early churchmen were often read in churches, being used as approved <I><FONT color=brown>sermons</FONT></I>. Hence the branch of theological study that treats of the art of planing, writing and delivering <I><FONT color=brown>sermons</FONT></I> is called "homiletics."</P><P>In informal use, <I><FONT color=brown>lecture</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>sermon</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>harangue</FONT></I> may all imply didactic moral instruction, referring to formal reproofs, stern rebukes, lengthy reprimands or earnest exhortations to duty. [He gave the boy a <I><FONT color=brown>lecture</FONT></I> on his lateness; She was subjected to a <I><FONT color=brown>harangue</FONT></I> on her supposed ingratitude; "All right, I'll do it," he said; "you don’t have to preach me a <I><FONT color=brown>sermon</FONT></I> about it.] </P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Spiel</FONT></B>, originally an Americanism, refer to a special kind of talk in which the speaker might be quite garrulous, aggressive or dogmatic. Essentially, a <I><FONT color=brown>spiel</FONT></I> presents a "line" or type of sales talk in a rather set, identifying pattern: His <I><FONT color=brown>spiel</FONT></I> was too long-winded and exaggerated to be convincing; What a <I><FONT color=brown>spiel</FONT></I> he has! It is sometimes used in a slangy way for talk in general.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conversation">CONVERSATION</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer either to an inability or unwillingness to speak or produce sound or to be intelligible. <B><FONT color=blue>Speechless</FONT></B> often refers to a transitory inability to speak because of shock or powerful emotions: struck <I><FONT color=brown>speechless</FONT></I> by the news. In a similar way one is often <B><FONT color=blue>tongue-tied</FONT></B> by nervousness or embarrassment and simply cannot get the words out: He stood <I><FONT color=brown>tongue-tied</FONT></I> before the huge audience. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>speechless</FONT></I> can indicate an impairment of speech functions: The brain damage resulted in an aphasia that rendered her husband totally <I><FONT color=brown>speechless</FONT></I>. Much more commonly, however, <B><FONT color=blue>dumb</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>mute</FONT></B> refer to any such sort of permanent inability to speak. <I><FONT color=brown>Dumb</FONT></I> may refer to this inability when caused by some defect of the speech organs, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>mute</FONT></I> is often the word of choice when the inability results, instead, from never having heard speech sounds, as in deafness sustained since infancy: a child who was dumb because of deformed vocal cords; a technique for teaching <I><FONT color=brown>mute</FONT></I> children to speak in spite of their deafness. Sometimes mute is substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I>, regardless of cause, since <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I> can also apply informally as a pejorative word for mental dullness. This linking of two unrelated deprivations may once have been deliberate but it is now felt to be both inaccurate and cruel. <I><FONT color=brown>Dumb</FONT></I> can also function like <I><FONT color=brown>speechless</FONT></I> to indicate a temporary loss of speech, though it can refer as well to an inability to make any sort of sound because of shock or emotion: <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I> with fright. In this context, mute more often refers to a deliberate refusal to speak: She answered his question with mute contempt; a prisoner who stolidly remained mute under the most excruciating tortures they could devise. When the reference is not to people, <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I> refers to a possibly natural or normal incapacity for speech but not necessarily to an inability to produce sound: <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I> animals. In a similar situation, <I><FONT color=brown>mute</FONT></I> may refer to complete soundlessness: the <I><FONT color=brown>mute</FONT></I> hush of the forest at dusk. The verb form of the word is of interest here, since it refers to altered or subdued sound: <I><FONT color=brown>muted</FONT></I> trumpets.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inarticulate</FONT></B> can be a vague and confusing word, since it can refer to what is soundless, <I><FONT color=brown>speechless</FONT></I>, unintelligible, confused or halting ?at times rather like <I><FONT color=brown>tongue-tied</FONT></I>, which is far more colloquial. Only context can make clear which notion is intended: His mouth worked to form words, but he remained completely <I><FONT color=brown>inarticulate</FONT></I>; gasping in inarticulate fright; lines in the play that were lost because of <I><FONT color=brown>inarticulate</FONT></I> mumbling; an <I><FONT color=brown>inarticulate</FONT></I> presentation of his idea; simple lessons that help stutters to be less <I><FONT color=brown>inarticulate</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Incoherent</FONT></B> can sometimes be substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>speechless</FONT></I>, but most often it clearly implies confused statements or halting speech: an <I><FONT color=brown>incoherent</FONT></I> essay filled with circumlocution and digression; stammered accusations and <I><FONT color=brown>incoherent</FONT></I> outcries.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Silent">SILENT</A>, <A href="entry://Stutter">STUTTER</A>, <A href="entry://Taciturn">TACITURN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: articulate, <A href="entry://Talkative">TALKATIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Verbose">VERBOSE</A>.</P>

spendthrift
<B><FONT color=blue>spendthrift</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>improvident</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>prodigal</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>thriftless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>wasteful</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the extravagant or imprudent spending or use of one’s resources. <B><FONT color=blue>Spendthrift</FONT></B> is the most informal of these words and the most clear and specific. It points exclusively to the spending of one’s money in ways that are excessive, unwise or unnecessary: putting their children on strict allowances to cure them of being <I><FONT color=brown>spendthrift</FONT></I>. The word by itself carries no implications about the money available to such a spender or about the consequences of such spending: a legendary <I><FONT color=brown>spendthrift</FONT></I> millionaire; the penurious rich and the <I><FONT color=brown>spendthrift</FONT></I> poor. The word was once, perhaps, more disapproving than it necessarily is now: uncomplaining when he was hard up, but <I><FONT color=brown>spendthrift</FONT></I> with his windfalls.</P><P>Of the remaining words, <B><FONT color=blue>prodigal</FONT></B> is closest in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>spendthrift</FONT></I>, though it refers beyond the spending of money to any lavish or foolish extravagance, often one of awesome proportions: a <I><FONT color=brown>prodigal</FONT></I> shopping spree; the <I><FONT color=brown>prodigal</FONT></I> extravaganzas that Hollywood turns out. The word may be used without disapproval for extreme generosity: <I><FONT color=brown>prodigal</FONT></I> in the time she spent with any student who needed extra help. In any case, the word emphasizes the quantity of expenditure involved, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>spendthrift</FONT></I> can conceivably suggest the unconcerned spending of what one has, regardless of the amount. Sometimes, <I><FONT color=brown>prodigal</FONT></I> is understood as referring to someone who, after having wasted all his substance, returns home in repentance, after the Biblical parable of the <I><FONT color=brown>prodigal</FONT></I> son.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Improvident</FONT></B>, the most formal of these words, indicates the unwise use of anything, with a specific emphasis on failing to foresee or provide for the future: the <I><FONT color=brown>improvident</FONT></I> grasshopper in the fable who, unlike the industrious ant, had failed to lay in supplies against the winter; <I><FONT color=brown>improvident</FONT></I> bon vivants who live only for the moment, with no thought for tomorrow. <B><FONT color=blue>Thriftless</FONT></B> relates to <I><FONT color=brown>improvident</FONT></I> in pointing to someone unable to save money or to manage his affairs economically, but the emphasis on the future is not, necessarily present: the average bachelor’s <I><FONT color=brown>thriftless</FONT></I> hit-and-miss budgeting of income. The word is distinct from <I><FONT color=brown>spendthrift</FONT></I> in that no squandering need be implied in this case. An impoverished family could not be <I><FONT color=brown>prodigal</FONT></I>, though it might or might not be <I><FONT color=brown>spendthrift</FONT></I> with what resources it had; it would most likely be compelled to be <I><FONT color=brown>thriftless</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Wasteful</FONT></B> is the most general of these in applying widely beyond the context of spending money; it suggests an unwise or reckless misuse of resources that fails to get the full benefit from them: <I><FONT color=brown>wasteful</FONT></I> to spend so much on a dress you'll wear only once; <I><FONT color=brown>wasteful</FONT></I> of the company’s times, though miserly with his own; tragically <I><FONT color=brown>wasteful</FONT></I> of natural resources that can never be replaced.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Generous">GENEROUS</A>, <A href="entry://Reckless">RECKLESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cautious">CAUTIOUS</A>, frugal, miserly, niggardly, thrifty.</P>

<P>These words refer to actions that are taken on the spur of the moment or without forethought. <B><FONT color=blue>Spontaneous</FONT></B> includes both these ideas and may often include, as well, suggestions of naturalness, frankness and good humour: the child’s <I><FONT color=brown>spontaneous</FONT></I> answers to all out questions. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>spontaneous</FONT></I> is deliberately contrasted with such words as routine or conformist: the <I><FONT color=brown>spontaneous</FONT></I> exuberance of teenagers when they feel free to be themselves. In another use, the word is sometimes restricted in reference to voluntary rather than coerced action or to action that comes about by general agreement arising out of immediate circumstances: a committee; a <I><FONT color=brown>spontaneous</FONT></I> protest demonstration that began with a few disgruntled students and ended in a march on one of the administration buildings. <B><FONT color=blue>Impulsive</FONT></B> is far less positive in its implications as compared to spontaneous. It may, in fact, suggest someone governed by or at the consequently, lacks the overtone of good humour present in <I><FONT color=brown>spontaneous</FONT></I> and can apply to ugly or disruptive actions as well as to pleasant ones: an <I><FONT color=brown>impulsive</FONT></I> generosity that alternates fitfully with equally <I><FONT color=brown>impulsive</FONT></I> temper tantrums. In some cases, the word can be used to describe actions occurring on the spur of the moment: supermarkets that display their wares to encourage customers to make <I><FONT color=brown>impulsive</FONT></I> purchases of items not on their shopping lists.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unplanned</FONT></B> is the most neutral of these words in stressing only the lack of forethought and carrying no emotional overtones about the quality of the action: an <I><FONT color=brown>unplanned</FONT></I> stop-over in Djakarta because of questions in depth. <B><FONT color=blue>Unpremeditated</FONT></B> is the most technical of these words; in legal terminology, it refers to an <I><FONT color=brown>impulsive</FONT></I> crime committed without forethought and therefore <I><FONT color=brown>unplanned</FONT></I>. This would be less serious than the same crime devised in advance. Except in a legal context, it would sound stiff as a substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>unplanned</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>impulsive</FONT></I>, unless a comic touch were intended: a party that turned out to be an <I><FONT color=brown>unpremeditated</FONT></I> disaster.</P><P>The remaining words pertain mostly to a context of public speaking or musical and theatrical performance. <B><FONT color=blue>Extemporaneous</FONT></B> refers specifically to a speech delivered on the spur of the moment without notes, but especially without a written version of the speech to be given: ministers long used to working up overnight an <I><FONT color=brown>extemporaneous</FONT></I> Sunday sermon; the question-and-answer period of the television debate that by its very nature had to be <I><FONT color=brown>extemporaneous</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Impromptu</FONT></B> pertains, most specifically, to a kind of musical performance in which the music played is invented as the performer goes along: an overblown piano fantasy that was surely <I><FONT color=brown>impromptu</FONT></I>. The word is often used also of speeches delivered on short notice: <I><FONT color=brown>impromptu</FONT></I> speeches tacked on the each seconding motion. In this area, the word can be distinguished from <I><FONT color=brown>extemporaneous</FONT></I> in that the latter may be a matter of choice, even when the speech has been set long in advance, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>impromptu</FONT></I> suggests being called on to speak when one is not expecting it and is therefore of necessity unprepared. [The teacher gave the same <I><FONT color=brown>extemporaneous</FONT></I> reprimand, word for word, to every student caught cheating; nor did he flicker an eyelid as he listened to their <I><FONT color=brown>impromptu</FONT></I> replies.]</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>unrehearsed</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>improvised</FONT></B> can be used in either a musical or a theatrical context. <I><FONT color=brown>Unrehearsed</FONT></I>, here, may suggest that a set piece is to be performed, but that the players have not previously played it through. In this context, <I><FONT color=brown>improvised</FONT></I> would suggest a basic structure within which the players have considerable opportunities for <I><FONT color=brown>spontaneous</FONT></I> invention. Although <I><FONT color=brown>improvised</FONT></I> is generally used in a neutrally descriptive way, <I><FONT color=brown>unrehearsed</FONT></I> can sometimes suggest a negative judgement: Jazz is necessarily <I><FONT color=brown>improvised</FONT></I>, but it is ridiculous to think of it as <I><FONT color=brown>unrehearsed</FONT></I>. In a more general context, <I><FONT color=brown>unrehearsed</FONT></I> approaches <I><FONT color=brown>spontaneous</FONT></I> in its implications, stressing a voluntary and <I><FONT color=brown>unplanned</FONT></I> telling or acting out: He asked bluntly if the witness’s evidence was freely given and <I><FONT color=brown>unrehearsed</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Improvised</FONT></I> can suggest a rough-and-ready substitute for something lacking or the making of decisions as one goes along: an <I><FONT color=brown>improvised</FONT></I> tent-pole made from a stripped branch; an <I><FONT color=brown>improvised</FONT></I> tour, taking them from place to place as the spirit moved them.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Vague">VAGUE</A>, <A href="entry://Wander">WANDER</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: definite, forced, <A href="entry://Formal">FORMAL</A>, stylized.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>spread</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>circulate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>distribute</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>propagate</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the gradual gaining of ground by something. <B><FONT color=blue>Spread</FONT></B> is the most informal and general of these, with particular usefulness in referring to the ground gained by a species, a disease, an idea or a cultural mannerism: deciduous trees that slowly <I><FONT color=brown>spread</FONT></I> over most of the world; rats that <I><FONT color=brown>spread</FONT></I> bubonic plague throughout Europe; a rash <I><FONT color=brown>spreading</FONT></I> over most of her body; ideas that <I><FONT color=brown>spread</FONT></I> more rapidly in an age of instant communications; Carnaby Street fashions that <I><FONT color=brown>spread</FONT></I> quickly from London to Australia. <B><FONT color=blue>Propagate</FONT></B> also refers to something that gains ground or adherents. It suggests a conscious, laborious effort to stimulate the healthy growth of something: <I><FONT color=brown>propagating</FONT></I> a new species of seedless grapefruit. It can apply also to an insidious or harmful <I><FONT color=brown>spreading</FONT></I> of information: <I><FONT color=brown>propagating</FONT></I> the myth of racial superiority for his own devious ends.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Distribute</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>circulate</FONT></B> lack both the negative implications possible for <I><FONT color=brown>propagate</FONT></I>. They are both most often neutral in their concentration on techniques for the wide <I><FONT color=brown>spreading</FONT></I> of something through space. <I><FONT color=brown>Distribute</FONT></I> emphasizes easy access and is particularly relevant in reference to periodicals: paper vans that distribute the day’s newspapers throughout the city. The point of the word may be the availability of something to everyone concerned or the parcelling out of a given quantity among a group: <I><FONT color=brown>distributing</FONT></I> a copy of the new health-insurance plan to everyone in the office. <I><FONT color=brown>Circulate</FONT></I> is less concrete in reference than <I><FONT color=brown>distribute</FONT></I>. It, too, may refer to <I><FONT color=brown>distributing</FONT></I> periodicals [a paper that is <I><FONT color=brown>circulated</FONT></I> to the whole metropolitan area], but more often this word, as a verb, refers to actual movement through a mass: arterial blood that <I><FONT color=brown>circulates</FONT></I> oxygen throughout the body. The word may point also to a movement of ideas or mannerisms among a circle of people: conservative notions that <I><FONT color=brown>circulate</FONT></I> among the company’s power elite.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Permeate">PERMEATE</A>, <A href="entry://Escalate">ESCALATE</A>, <A href="entry://Scatter">SCATTER</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accumulate">ACCUMULATE</A>, <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, <A href="entry://Gather">GATHER</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote imaginary creatures of folklore, especially European folklore, who are human in form but have no souls. They are usually invisible and are capable of working either good or evil magic against mankind. <B><FONT color=blue>Sprite</FONT></B>, which is derived from the same source as "spirit," is much a creature who is ethereal or disembodied and who lives in the air rather than on the earth, as Ariel of Shakespeare’s <I><FONT color=brown>Tempest</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fairy</FONT></B> is the most generalized term for these beings. In the narrow sense, a <I><FONT color=brown>fairy</FONT></I> is thought of as diminutive, graceful and fair of face, but able to assume other shapes at will. <I><FONT color=brown>Fairies</FONT></I> may sometimes be masculine, but are more usually feminine. They inhabit woods, forests and fields, but maintain a close relationship with human beings towards whom they act in both an annoying or friendly fashion. Nowadays, the word has become a pejorative slang term to describe those male homosexuals thought to be effeminate or fey in manner or appearance.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Elf</FONT></B> is the word in English for the fairy of Teutonic folklore. <I><FONT color=brown>Elves</FONT></I> are popularly pictured as tiny, childlike beings with pointed ears, who are comical or quaint in appearance rather than delicate and beautiful. E<I><FONT color=brown>l</FONT></I>f suggests more of the spirit of playfulness and mischief than does <I><FONT color=brown>fairy</FONT></I>.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>gnome</FONT></B> is one of a group of dwarfish fairies typically resembling little old men with beards. They live underground in caves to guard buried treasure or mines containing precious metals. <I><FONT color=brown>Gnomes</FONT></I> are often skilled artisans able to fashion magical weapons and armour.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Goblin</FONT></B> suggests a misshapen elf of repulsive appearance who is always conceived of as being malevolent towards human beings. A night creature, he is the companion of witches and the Devil.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hobgoblin</FONT></B> is another word for <I><FONT color=brown>goblin</FONT></I>, although the <I><FONT color=brown>hobgoblin</FONT></I> is more often thought of as being annoying or impish in his behaviour towards people rather than evil. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>hobgoblin</FONT></I> has come to mean anything that elicits unfounded and unreasonable dread: closed-in spaces are his <I><FONT color=brown>hobgoblins</FONT></I>.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>gremlin</FONT></B> is a strictly modern <I><FONT color=brown>fairy</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>gnome</FONT></I> who is a trouble-maker. The term applies especially to a supernatural being who is blamed by pilots for virtually anything that can go unexpectedly and violently wrong with or in an aircraft. It is said that <I><FONT color=brown>gremlin</FONT></I> was coined after the beginning of World War II by an R.A.F. squadron-leader.

<B><FONT color=blue>spurious</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>apocryphal</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>brummy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>counterfeit</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>forged</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>shoddy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>snide</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to something that is false or worthless, particularly when it is passed off as being genuine or valuable. <B><FONT color=blue>Spurious</FONT></B>, the most general of these words, derives ultimately from a Latin word for bastard. It is harshly condemnatory in tone, whether or not an attempt to deceive is implied. It rarely now refer to illegitimacy: a <I><FONT color=brown>spurious</FONT></I> heir. More often it refers to something that has been mistaken for the real item: <I><FONT color=brown>spurious</FONT></I> paintings attributed to old masters. The word generally leaves no doubt that deception is involved: a political candidate who made <I><FONT color=brown>spurious</FONT></I> promises in order to get elected. But when the word applies to reason or logic, a deliberate attempt to mislead need not necessarily be involved: False assumptions lead to <I><FONT color=brown>spurious</FONT></I> conclusions; an attempt to demonstrate that his opponent’s argument was <I><FONT color=brown>spurious</FONT></I> in every detail.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Counterfeit</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>forged</FONT></B> are exclusively focused on deliberate attempts to deceive or defraud. Most typically, <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I> pertains to false money, forged to false signatures, as on a cheque: <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I> ten-dollar notes; a <I><FONT color=brown>forged</FONT></I> endorsement on the traveller’s cheque. Both words can apply also to anything that is made to pass for something authentic or of value: a <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I> painting; <I><FONT color=brown>forged</FONT></I> passports. Usually, <I><FONT color=brown>forged</FONT></I> retains some implication of a false signature that seems to make good a product or document, but <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I> applies more widely to anything insincere: an attempt to deceive the public with their <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I> optimism over the results of the government action; the <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I> concern that she lavished on her husband in public.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shoddy</FONT></B> can still occasionally refer to a fabric of reclaimed wool. By extension, it now refers universally to anything that is inferior in materials or construction: <I><FONT color=brown>shoddy</FONT></I> housing developments destined to become the slums of the future. The word can point also to any vulgar or pretentious imitation or anything cheap that purports to be of superior quality: <I><FONT color=brown>shoddy</FONT></I> nightclubs whose meretricious glitter is designed to trap unwary tourists. It refers also to base behaviour or meanness of character: No woman deserves that sort of <I><FONT color=brown>shoddy</FONT></I> treatment. Sometimes the stress of the word is on whatever is unsavoury, low-grade or of dubious reputation: the tramp’s <I><FONT color=brown>shoddy</FONT></I> clothes; the <I><FONT color=brown>shoddy</FONT></I> quarter of town; a <I><FONT color=brown>shoddy</FONT></I> trickster.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brummy</FONT></B>, a shortened form of <I><FONT color=brown>brummagem</FONT></I>, which in turn is a vulgar form of <I><FONT color=brown>Birmingham</FONT></I>, is an informal word for <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I>. It has the special sense of a <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I> coin but applies widely to objects ?particularly of metal ?that are cheap imitations: I bought some <I><FONT color=brown>brummy</FONT></I> horse brasses, which were just like the real thing. The word is used loosely for anything cheap, false or sham, in which sense it is very similar to <I><FONT color=brown>shoddy</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Snide</FONT></B> also has the basic notion of counterfeit but, while associated with <I><FONT color=brown>spurious</FONT></I> currency, it seems to have been used mainly in the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>counterfeit</FONT></I> jewellery. Like <I><FONT color=brown>brummy</FONT></I>, it is now used in a more general way for <I><FONT color=brown>shoddy</FONT></I>, but, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>brummy</FONT></I>, it can apply to underhand or mean behaviour: Such a <I><FONT color=brown>snide</FONT></I> character that no one trusted him; making <I><FONT color=brown>snide</FONT></I> remarks.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Apocryphal</FONT></B> is the most restricted of these words in that it always applies to accounts of the past whose truth or accuracy cannot be determined. In reference to disputed theological documents, the implication is that such works have been rejected from the accepted or official cannon: the <I><FONT color=brown>apocryphal</FONT></I> sayings of Jesus that are excluded from the New Testament. Outside this context, the word can refer to what is legendary or unprovable: an <I><FONT color=brown>apocryphal</FONT></I> story about Lincoln as a young boy. Here, the word can refer to any body of myth and anecdote that grows up spontaneously around an object of reverence or curiosity: <I><FONT color=brown>apocryphal</FONT></I> feats attributed to Ned Kelly.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artificial">ARTIFICIAL</A>, <A href="entry://Deception">DECEPTION</A>, <A href="entry://Sham">SHAM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Accurate">ACCURATE</A>, authentic, <A href="entry://Genuine">GENUINE</A>, <A href="entry://Sincere">SINCERE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote a person who secretly gathers information about persons or about countries other than his own, usually for destructive purposes. <B><FONT color=blue>Spy</FONT></B> is the most general term. In a narrow sense, a spy is one engaged in espionage ?that is, his is sent secretly into another country to obtain military or political information wanted by his own country. If captured, especially in time of war, a <I><FONT color=brown>spy</FONT></I> is subject to death by firing squad. In a wider sense the word is derogatory and is applied to one who uses underhand and furtive means to observe the activities of others, usually for personal gain: The director has <I><FONT color=brown>spies</FONT></I> in every department.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>secret agent</FONT></B> are now preferred to spy when signifying a person employed by a government to engage in espionage. An <I><FONT color=brown>agent</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>secret agent</FONT></I> enters a foreign country under a disguise and usually resides there for a time. His work is to learn the military secrets and other facts about that country which will be of use to his own government. An <I><FONT color=brown>agent</FONT></I> may also be sent within the borders of a belligerent power to commit acts of sabotage that will weaken the defences of the enemy. <I><FONT color=brown>Agent</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>secret agent</FONT></I> may be applied also to investigators within a government who probe into treasonable activities, counterfeiting and other infringements of the law: a Security Organization <I><FONT color=brown>agent</FONT></I>.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>counterspy</FONT></B> is an agent who spies on the <I><FONT color=brown>secret agents</FONT></I> of the enemy, often within his own country, in order to thwart their activities and destroy their efficiency.</P><P>The <B><FONT color=blue>double agent</FONT></B>, or "<I><FONT color=brown>double spy</FONT></I>," is employed simultaneously by two opposing countries and engages in espionage against both of them while pretending to be working for only one. A <I><FONT color=brown>double agent</FONT></I> may actually be loyal to one country or he may practise deception towards both sides. <I><FONT color=brown>Double agents</FONT></I> often make effective <I><FONT color=brown>counterspies</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agent provocateur</FONT></B> is a French term designating a <I><FONT color=brown>spy</FONT></I> who is planted in a trade union, political party or other organization in which there are conflicting loyalties. His method is to gain the trust of the members of the group and to stir them to actions or declarations that will incur punishment. <I><FONT color=brown>Agent provocateur</FONT></I> carries also a suggestion of opprobrium, since, unlike the espionage agent, the <I><FONT color=brown>agent provocateur</FONT></I> may be acting against and betraying his own kind.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Overhear">OVERHEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Spectator">SPECTATOR</A>, <A href="entry://Stealthy">STEALTHY</A>.</P>

<P>These words are imitative of the shrill cries made by certain birds, insects or animals. All may be used as either nouns or verbs, and most apply to human sounds as well, and have other, extended applications. A <B><FONT color=blue>squeal</FONT></B> is a shrill, high-pitched, somewhat prolonged nasal cry, the sort of sound that is made by a young pig. <B><FONT color=blue>Squeak</FONT></B> denotes a shorter, weaker cry ?a very high-pitched, thin, sharp, penetrating sound, such as the little piping noise made by a mouse. One may <I><FONT color=brown>squeal</FONT></I> out of surprise, excitement, fright, pain, anger or protest: children <I><FONT color=brown>squealing</FONT></I> with delight; to <I><FONT color=brown>squeal</FONT></I> in terror at a horror film. One may <I><FONT color=brown>squeak</FONT></I> because of a high-pitched voice or laryngitis: The boy’s voice was changing and would go from a deep tone to a shrill <I><FONT color=brown>squeak</FONT></I> without warning.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Screech</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>squawk</FONT></B> refer to shrill, harsh cries or to sounds that are strident or raucous. A <I><FONT color=brown>screech</FONT></I> is a long, harsh, piercing sound ?a grating scream or shriek: a small owl that <I><FONT color=brown>screeches</FONT></I> weirdly. One may <I><FONT color=brown>screech</FONT></I> out of pain, terror or anguish: a <I><FONT color=brown>screeching</FONT></I> woman trapped in a burning building. <I><FONT color=brown>Screech</FONT></I> is also disdainfully applied to a loud, high singing voice that sounds terribly forced and strained: That soprano isn’t singing ?she’s <I><FONT color=brown>screeching</FONT></I>! A <I><FONT color=brown>squawk</FONT></I> is a shrill, harsh cry such as is made by a parrot or a frightened hen. <I><FONT color=brown>Squawk</FONT></I> is applied also to any sound reminiscent of such a cry: a <I><FONT color=brown>squawking</FONT></I> radio.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chirp</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>cheep</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>peep</FONT></B> denote the high, thin, pointed sounds made by young birds. A <I><FONT color=brown>chirp</FONT></I> is a clear, bright sound ?a short, sharp, high-pitched cry, such as one made repeatedly by a bird or insect: <I><FONT color=brown>chirping</FONT></I> sparrows; the cricket’s <I><FONT color=brown>chirp</FONT></I>. A person may make a somewhat similar sound (or chirrup) by drawing the breath through the closed lips or tongue and teeth, as in greeting an infant or urging on a horse. A <I><FONT color=brown>cheep</FONT></I> is a faint, shrill sound ?a weak, feeble <I><FONT color=brown>chirp</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>squeak</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>cheep</FONT></I> of a chicken. A <I><FONT color=brown>peep</FONT></I> is the kind of tiny cry made by young or very small creatures: the <I><FONT color=brown>peep</FONT></I> of a frightened mouse. Applied to human utterance, <I><FONT color=brown>chirp</FONT></I> means to talk or say in a quick, vivacious way, to cry out cheerfully with birdlike enthusiasm: "Good morning," <I><FONT color=brown>chirped</FONT></I> the children.</P><P>Applied to things, <I><FONT color=brown>squeak</FONT></I> designates a shrill, creaking sound indicative of stiffness or friction: the <I><FONT color=brown>squeak</FONT></I> of new shoes; a <I><FONT color=brown>speaking</FONT></I> hinge. <I><FONT color=brown>Squeal</FONT></I> refers to a loud, drawn-out, nasal sound that is reminiscent of a hurt, protesting cry: <I><FONT color=brown>squealing</FONT></I> brakes. <I><FONT color=brown>Screech</FONT></I> implies a harsher, more earsplitting noise: The underground train <I><FONT color=brown>screeched</FONT></I> to a stop.</P><P>In idiomatic speech, to <I><FONT color=brown>squeak by</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>squeak through</FONT></I> is to make it by a hair’s-breadth, to succeed by an extremely narrow margin: He just managed to <I><FONT color=brown>squeak through</FONT></I>, but he passed the course. In slang usage, to <I><FONT color=brown>squeal</FONT></I> is to turn informer, betraying one'?confederates, as in crime: You’d better not <I><FONT color=brown>squeal</FONT></I> if you know what’s good for you. To <I><FONT color=brown>squawk</FONT></I> is to complain or protest loudly in a harsh, shrill way: He really <I><FONT color=brown>squawked</FONT></I> when he found the hotel didn’t have his reservation. A <I><FONT color=brown>peep</FONT></I> is the slightest sound that one can make, especially a sign of dissatisfaction: I don’t want to hear a <I><FONT color=brown>peep</FONT></I> out of you.</P><P>There are also many words relating to the cries of specific animals or birds which cannot be given in full here. Thus we have the <B><FONT color=blue>caw</FONT></B> of a crow, <B><FONT color=blue>coo</FONT></B> of a dove and <B><FONT color=blue>hoot</FONT></B> of an owl. These are usually restricted far more than the above terms, although <I><FONT color=brown>hoot</FONT></I> is part of the idiom "does not give a <I><FONT color=brown>hoot</FONT></I>," which means does not care at all.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chatter">CHATTER</A>, <A href="entry://Cry">CRY</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable when they indicate a point of view or conviction about a practical matter, usually one expressed in words. <B><FONT color=blue>Stand</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>position</FONT></B> both refer to definite, expressed convictions about single issues that are the focal points of disagreement, debate or controversy. Stand often implies an emotional commitment, although it does not exclude intellectual or rational grounds for one’s feeling: to take a strong <I><FONT color=brown>stand</FONT></I> in favour of amending the abortion law. <I><FONT color=brown>Position</FONT></I> implies a more dispassionate and restrained attitude, often one decided upon after lengthy deliberation. [My <I><FONT color=brown>position</FONT></I> on civil liberties is sell known; He took the <I><FONT color=brown>position</FONT></I> that salvation depended upon good deeds as well as piety.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Policy</FONT></B> implies a definite structure of decisions and programme for action based on an assessment of one’s needs, interests, goals or principles: The United States government follows a <I><FONT color=brown>policy</FONT></I> of containing Communism in South-East Asia. In less formal contexts policy may mean any general rule of conduct: It’s a bad <I><FONT color=brown>policy</FONT></I> to lend money to friends. <B><FONT color=blue>Posture</FONT></B> in recent years has come to mean policy in a formal sense: the defence <I><FONT color=brown>posture</FONT></I> of ANZUS. But <I><FONT color=brown>posture</FONT></I> may indicate also the actual disposition of forces: a military <I><FONT color=brown>posture</FONT></I> that embraced the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles at key places on the periphery of the Soviet Union. In its several implications, <I><FONT color=brown>posture</FONT></I> may include also the sense of <B><FONT color=blue>attitude</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Attitude</FONT></I> is a more general term than the others here considered, and indicates a personal or institutional feeling, often unexpressed and vague in nature. In this it is at the other pole from <I><FONT color=brown>policy</FONT></I>, which represents a clearly formulated and precise enunciation of one’s view: The sympathetic <I><FONT color=brown>attitude</FONT></I> of the Cuban government to rebels in South and Central America has evolved, it is charged, into a <I><FONT color=brown>policy</FONT></I> of abetting and possibly fomenting insurrection in Latin American countries. <I><FONT color=brown>Posture</FONT></I> is therefore useful in suggesting a hardening of <I><FONT color=brown>attitude</FONT></I> without going so far as to imply a firm <I><FONT color=brown>policy</FONT></I>: the neutral <I><FONT color=brown>posture</FONT></I> of Britain in the Vietnam war; the belligerent <I><FONT color=brown>posture</FONT></I> of India towards the Chinese resulting from violent and unresolved border disputes.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Opinion">OPINION</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to sets of rules, formulas or principles by which to evaluate the quality of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Standard</FONT></B> implies an objective, impartial rule or set of rules that have actually been worked out in advance: the army’s <I><FONT color=brown>standards</FONT></I> for physical fitness; research that does not meet our <I><FONT color=brown>standard</FONT></I> for accuracy.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gauge</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>measure</FONT></B> may both suggest an actual physical tool to determine the dimensions or attributes of a product: a <I><FONT color=brown>gauge</FONT></I> for determining the thickness of wire; an anemometer or other <I><FONT color=brown>measure</FONT></I> of wind velocity. Rather than the yes-or-no evaluation suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>standard</FONT></I>, these two words suggest an objective assessment of attributes. In more metaphorical uses, <I><FONT color=brown>measure</FONT></I> is the less formal of the two: agricultural production as a <I><FONT color=brown>gauge</FONT></I> of the economy’s effectiveness; an honour system that will be a <I><FONT color=brown>measure</FONT></I> of our students?honesty.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Test</FONT></B> emphasizes the act of evaluation. The previous words suggest that means for evaluation and for assessment exist, without necessarily implying that they will be used. <I><FONT color=brown>Test</FONT></I> strongly implies an actual application of these means: combat as a <I><FONT color=brown>test</FONT></I> of the soldier’s bravery. [The <I><FONT color=brown>standards</FONT></I> applied so rigorously in our shoe factory are nothing compared to the real <I><FONT color=brown>test</FONT></I> to which consumers put each pair of shoes in actual day-to-day use.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Criterion</FONT></B>, the most formal of all these words, suggests the independent existence of <I><FONT color=brown>standards</FONT></I> that stress excellence. The implication is less strong that the discriminations suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>criterion</FONT></I> have been spelt out. The word, therefore, may suggest implicit taste as a more important part of the test than the mechanical application of an objective measure or gauge: candidates who feel that the sole <I><FONT color=brown>criterion</FONT></I> for office is the ability to win votes; Each individual is required to state the <I><FONT color=brown>criteria</FONT></I> on which his judgements are based.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Touchstone</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>yardstick</FONT></B> are metaphorical in suggesting something against which any attempt may be contrasted. Yardstick, the most informal of any of these words, implies a <I><FONT color=brown>standard</FONT></I> of comparison based on common sense, easy to apply, and giving a cut-and fired answer: a low rate of unemployment as the least ambiguous <I><FONT color=brown>yardstick</FONT></I> of a country’s well-being. <I><FONT color=brown>Touchstone</FONT></I> gives an entirely different feeling from <I><FONT color=brown>yardstick</FONT></I>; it suggests a set of imponderable values that cannot be measured absolutely so much as embodied in an earlier work against which the work in question is compared: Greek and Elizabethan tragedies that are the <I><FONT color=brown>touchstones</FONT></I> for all later theatrical effort. The word suggests a rarefied level of aesthetic discrimination based on tradition and precedence; it might even suggest preciosity: new artists who shattered the <I><FONT color=brown>touchstones</FONT></I> of Victorian sensibility.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Control">CONTROL</A>, <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>position</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rank</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>standing</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>status</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the relative degree of respect that someone is given by society in general or that someone attains by virtue of his accomplishments. <B><FONT color=blue>Position</FONT></B> is the most general, indicating one’s relative acceptance by society, one’s recognized professional attainments or one’s place in any structured order: families of wealth and <I><FONT color=brown>position</FONT></I>; a scholar of unimpeachable position in the academic world; assuming the <I><FONT color=brown>position</FONT></I> of treasurer for the club. <B><FONT color=blue>Standing</FONT></B> is a good deal m ore vague than <I><FONT color=brown>position</FONT></I>, referring to one’s place, high or low, in any graduated order: people who have no <I><FONT color=brown>standing</FONT></I> in their own communities; a member in good <I><FONT color=brown>standing</FONT></I>. In the latter example, the sense is restricted to minimal acceptance that puts one on an equal footing with other of a given group.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rank</FONT></B> may function in the same three areas as <I><FONT color=brown>position</FONT></I>, but it tends to suggest a more definable placement, such as one indicated by a specific title given by a hierarchical order: the highest <I><FONT color=brown>rank</FONT></I> of the nobility; attaining the <I><FONT color=brown>rank</FONT></I> of associate professor that year. The word is particularly pertinent to military <I><FONT color=brown>positions</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>rank</FONT></I> of staff-sergeant. <B><FONT color=blue>Status</FONT></B> has become the most fashionable of these words refer to all the indefinable qualities that make up social or professional success: a teacher of high <I><FONT color=brown>rank</FONT></I> but of little <I><FONT color=brown>status</FONT></I> among his colleagues. Unqualified, it suggests social acceptance: the constant striving for <I><FONT color=brown>status</FONT></I> in the middle classes. In this use, the word often has a negative tone and suggests the placing of undue emphasis on material values.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Class">CLASS</A>.</P>

<P>These words describe things done in concealment so as not to be noticed or found out. <B><FONT color=blue>Stealthy</FONT></B> comes from an Old English word meaning to steal. It suggests the quiet of an animal moving on padded feet, slyly stealing up on its prey or warily making its way past its enemies. [The scout made a <I><FONT color=brown>stealthy</FONT></I> approach to the enemy position; The escaping prisoner moved with <I><FONT color=brown>stealthy</FONT></I> tread until he was out of earshot of the sleeping guards.] <B><FONT color=blue>Furtive</FONT></B> comes from the Latin word for thief. It suggests the quick, nervous movements of someone who feels guilty or is afraid of getting caught: the <I><FONT color=brown>furtive</FONT></I> manner of an escaped convict; A <I><FONT color=brown>furtive</FONT></I> glance confirmed his fears梙e was being followed. <B><FONT color=blue>Surreptitious</FONT></B> comes from Latin roots meaning to snatch secretly. It describes something forbidden that is done or enjoyed on the sly, at an opportune moment when no one is looking: the sur<I><FONT color=brown>r</FONT></I>eptitious reading of a friend’s private diary; a dieter’s <I><FONT color=brown>surreptitious</FONT></I> snack.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Clandestine</FONT></B> comes from a Latin word meaning in secret. It suggests the wariness of one who hides what he is doing because of the social or political danger of discovery. What is done <I><FONT color=brown>clandestinely</FONT></I> is either illicit or considered to be so, being done under cover because it is frowned on by society or forbidden by those in authority: a <I><FONT color=brown>clandestine</FONT></I> meeting of young lovers; a <I><FONT color=brown>clandestine</FONT></I> meeting to plan a robbery. Where a <I><FONT color=brown>surreptitious</FONT></I> act is done quickly, a <I><FONT color=brown>clandestine</FONT></I> activity may be carried on over a long period of time: a <I><FONT color=brown>clandestine</FONT></I> love affair: a <I><FONT color=brown>clandestine</FONT></I> publication put out by an underground organization.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sneaky</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>underhand</FONT></B> carry the suggestion of cheating, of unfair dealings and self-serving manipulations behind the scenes. Whereas the other adjectives emphasize the fear of detection, <I><FONT color=brown>underhand</FONT></I> suggests a sly and crafty secrecy practised not for protection but for gain ?stooping to trickery, deceit or fraud for one’s own profit: to win a union ballot by <I><FONT color=brown>underhand</FONT></I> means. <I><FONT color=brown>Sneaky</FONT></I> is more general and less formal than <I><FONT color=brown>underhand</FONT></I>, and emphasizes the deceitful or double-dealing nature of one’s actions more than the selfishness of one’s motives. It suggests a <I><FONT color=brown>clandestine</FONT></I> or roundabout manner concealing an insidious calculation: There was something <I><FONT color=brown>sneaky</FONT></I> and sinister about him, so that you mistrusted him on instinct; the <I><FONT color=brown>sneaky</FONT></I> habit of filching coins from his mother’s purse.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lurk">LURK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: obvious, open, <A href="entry://Overt">OVERT</A>, straightforward.</P>

<P>These words all mean to become or remain closely and firmly attached. <B><FONT color=blue>Stick</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>adhere</FONT></B> express the idea of maintaining a close or permanent union by or as if by gluing or cementing together. <I><FONT color=brown>Stick</FONT></I> is the less formal word of the two and conveys in addition the establishing of such an attachment: two young men who intend to <I><FONT color=brown>stick</FONT></I> together when they enter the armed services; to <I><FONT color=brown>stick</FONT></I> a label on a package. <I><FONT color=brown>Stick</FONT></I> may also imply perseverance, as in working at something or in keeping to an ideal, bargain, etc.: <I><FONT color=brown>sticking</FONT></I> doggedly at his physics homework until long after midnight; <I><FONT color=brown>sticking</FONT></I> to his principles of fair play; <I><FONT color=brown>sticking</FONT></I> to an agreement made in a moment of optimism. <I><FONT color=brown>Adhere</FONT></I>, which is always used intransitively, may sound formal and stiff when applied to things: a stamp <I><FONT color=brown>adhering</FONT></I> to a postcard.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cohere</FONT></B>, also an intransitive, refers to the <I><FONT color=brown>adhering</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>sticking</FONT></I> together of the particles of a substance, which then form a resultant whole or mass that is resistant to separation: Plaster of Pairs <I><FONT color=brown>coheres</FONT></I> only when water is added. Figurative usage may indicate the achievement of logical consistency: An argument <I><FONT color=brown>coheres</FONT></I> only if it validly bridges the premise and the conclusion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cling</FONT></B> is used to indicate a close attachment caused by entwining, clutching or hanging on, rather than by gluing or otherwise causing surfaces to adhere: ivy <I><FONT color=brown>clinging</FONT></I> to brick walls; a baby koala <I><FONT color=brown>clinging</FONT></I> to its mother by clutching her fur. In the sense of holding on to attitudes, beliefs or emotional states, <I><FONT color=brown>cling</FONT></I> used as a synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>adhere</FONT></I> often has derogatory connotations suggestive of the presence of anxiety or dependency: a widow <I><FONT color=brown>clinging</FONT></I> to her grown son; people who, despite obvious intelligence, persist in <I><FONT color=brown>clinging</FONT></I> to old prejudices.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cleave</FONT></B>, in the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>adhere</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>stick</FONT></I>, is now largely a literary or Biblical term for being closely attached, as in a human relationship marked by fidelity: to <I><FONT color=brown>cleave</FONT></I> to one’s marriage partner through sickness and misfortune. In a few contexts, <I><FONT color=brown>cleave</FONT></I> is still used to mean literally to <I><FONT color=brown>adhere</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>stick</FONT></I> closely: In his terror his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Connect">CONNECT</A>, <A href="entry://Tie">TIE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Leave">LEAVE</A> (abandon), <A href="entry://Shake">SEPARATE</A>, <A href="entry://Sever">SEVER</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer, by means of a metaphor of disfigurement, to the lasting harm or discredit that may attach to someone because of an impropriety or injustice. As treated here, they all imply a distinction between such a disfigurement and those flaws that are present as an innate part of one’s character. A person may acquire a <B><FONT color=blue>stigma</FONT></B> because of some improper act of his own or, more arbitrarily, because of an unfortunate situation not of his own making: prevented from seeking office by the <I><FONT color=brown>stigma</FONT></I> of his perjury conviction; the dull eyes and pinched minds of children who thus already gave evidence of bearing the <I><FONT color=brown>stigma</FONT></I> of poverty.

Of the three, <I><FONT color=brown>stain</FONT></I> suggests the greatest or most serious breach: a <I><FONT color=brown>stain</FONT></I> on her reputation that she could never eradicate. <I><FONT color=brown>Blot</FONT></I>, by contrast, can be used almost euphemistically to extenuate a breach as accidental or slight: a record that like anyone else’s showed a <I><FONT color=brown>blot</FONT></I> or two here and there. Clashing with this implication, the word appears sometimes in orotund rhetoric to mean an especially heinous disfigurement: a political ideology that is a <I><FONT color=brown>blot</FONT></I> on the name of democracy. In this sense, it is part of a common but shop-worn expression: a <I><FONT color=brown>blot</FONT></I> on the escutcheon. <I><FONT color=brown>Taint</FONT></I> suggests a moral breach slighter than either stain or <I><FONT color=brown>blot</FONT></I>. Leaving aside the use in which it refers to a slight but innate flaw, it still stresses a vague or subtle imprint and may suggest, in fact, a less permanent discrediting than any of these other words: surrounded by the <I><FONT color=brown>taint</FONT></I> of a scandal that would, nevertheless, fade with time. Even the underlying metaphor here is unique in suggesting a slight but permeating discolouration more than a single but plainly observable scar.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mark</FONT></B> is the least specific in this context and carries the fewest overtones. It has so many other uses that its sense of disfigurement would have to be made clear by context: a <I><FONT color=brown>mark</FONT></I> against him; accusations that left a <I><FONT color=brown>mark</FONT></I> on his reputation. <B><FONT color=blue>Stigmata</FONT></B> is the one word here that does not imply shame or dishonour, referring instead to <I><FONT color=brown>marks</FONT></I> said to appear miraculously on the hands and feet of certain saints, <I><FONT color=brown>marks</FONT></I> that correspond to the wounds inflicted at the Crucifixion.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>brand</FONT></B> was originally a <I><FONT color=brown>mark</FONT></I> burnt on criminals or slaves to proclaim their status; it is now an easily identifiable design put on cattle with a hot iron to indicate ownership. Figuratively used, <I><FONT color=brown>brand</FONT></I> is a close synonym of stigma, but suggests an even greater dishonour or notoriety, which like the burnt-on <I><FONT color=brown>mark</FONT></I> is difficult or impossible to eradicate: a man bearing the <I><FONT color=brown>brand</FONT></I> of having informed against his comrades; the <I><FONT color=brown>brand</FONT></I> of illegitimacy once placed on innocent children.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Burn">BURN</A>, <A href="entry://Disfigure">DISFIGURE</A>, <A href="entry://Eccentricity">ECCENTRICITY</A>, <A href="entry://Flaw">FLAW</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to what arouses interest, motivates to action or is satisfying and invigorating. <B><FONT color=blue>Stimulate</FONT></B> is the most general of these, applying in all three situations: a remark that <I><FONT color=brown>stimulated</FONT></I> my curiosity; a crisis that finally <I><FONT color=brown>stimulated</FONT></I> the government into acting; an impromptu jazz session that everyone present found to be extremely <I><FONT color=brown>stimulating</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Excite</FONT></B> also can apply to the arousal of interest, but in this sense it has a more formal tone than <I><FONT color=brown>stimulate</FONT></I>: a book that <I><FONT color=brown>excited</FONT></I> a great deal of an intense emotional response: They feared that the visitors would <I><FONT color=brown>excite</FONT></I> the patient too much; His raw anti-Semitism <I><FONT color=brown>excited</FONT></I> the crowd to fury.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Enliven</FONT></B> applies solely to what is both arousing and invigorating: an outspoken couple who could always be counted on to <I><FONT color=brown>enliven</FONT></I> a dull party; open-air sculpture to <I><FONT color=brown>enliven</FONT></I> the grey uniformity of the city. <B><FONT color=blue>Galvanize</FONT></B>, by contrast, applies strictly to setting something decisively in motion, particularly after a period of vacillation or disorganization: new supporting troops to <I><FONT color=brown>galvanize</FONT></I> our flagging counter-offensive; a tragedy that <I><FONT color=brown>galvanized</FONT></I> the government into action.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Titillate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>whet</FONT></B> also apply exclusively to one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>stimulate</FONT></I>, indicating an initial arousal of interest or desire. Most concretely, whet applies to an appetite for food: hors d'oeuvres to <I><FONT color=brown>whet</FONT></I> the appetite. Similarly, when the word applies in other contexts, it usually suggests partaking of a small sample that leads to a desire for some larger portion: government action that only <I><FONT color=brown>whetted</FONT></I> the desires of Aborigines for full equality; an opening chapter that <I><FONT color=brown>whets</FONT></I> the reader’s interest in reading on. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>titillate</FONT></I> need not suggest any actual sampling at all. While it can function like <I><FONT color=brown>whet</FONT></I> in the context of food, it more often suggests a tempting action achieved through allusion, insinuation or promises of what is to come. It implies raising eager expectations of whatever kind, whether or not these promises are later fulfilled.

<B><FONT color=blue>stint</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>assignment</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>chore</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>duty</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>job</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>task</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to a limited or non-recurring piece of work. <B><FONT color=blue>Stint</FONT></B> is most clear about the once-only or temporary nature of the work; it suggests the limited period of time in which something is done. [He never starred in a long-running play, though he did several short <I><FONT color=brown>stints</FONT></I> in repertory theatre; wandering from one university to another including <I><FONT color=brown>stints</FONT></I> at Sydney and Melbourne.] <I><FONT color=brown>Stint</FONT></I> thus suggests a relatively brief undertaking that is voluntary or agreed-upon. <B><FONT color=blue>Assignment</FONT></B> is both more formal and more general, and is applicable in a great many contexts. It indicates a limited commitment that is more likely to be involuntary than is the case with <I><FONT color=brown>stint</FONT></I>; chafing at the unpleasant <I><FONT color=brown>assignment</FONT></I> that had fallen to him at the whim of his employer. But this need not always be so: offering to take on the two-week <I><FONT color=brown>assignment</FONT></I> himself. Furthermore, the word can refer to a permanent, long-term role: his <I><FONT color=brown>assignment</FONT></I> as company secretary lasted for 20 years. Or it may specifically apply to a student’s homework: a hard arithmetic <I><FONT color=brown>assignment</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chore</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>task</FONT></B> both indicate a circumscribed or short-term undertaking, whether voluntary or not, and suggest an undertaking that will require a certain amount of effort. The words contrasts in that the more general <I><FONT color=brown>task</FONT></I> is more nearly neutral in its connotations, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>chore</FONT></I> suggests something particularly onerous, uninteresting or even unpleasant, despite the short duration suggested: relishing every <I><FONT color=brown>task</FONT></I> that fell to him, no matter how fiddling; complaining about how much he hated the <I><FONT color=brown>chore</FONT></I> of washing dishes after every meal. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>task</FONT></I> is less specific about duration and can suggest effort arising out of personal commitment or obligation: the <I><FONT color=brown>task</FONT></I> of political reform, to which he selflessly devoted his best efforts throughout a long life. <I><FONT color=brown>Chore</FONT></I> nearly always connotes grudging reluctance: when going to parties becomes a <I><FONT color=brown>chore</FONT></I> rather than a pleasure. Used in the plural, it applies to routine household or farm duties and has homely ring: to do the <I><FONT color=brown>chores</FONT></I>.</P><P>In the context of a specific, short-term effort, <B><FONT color=blue>job</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>duty</FONT></B> emphasize different aspects of <I><FONT color=brown>task</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Job</FONT></I> is neutral and general, open to the qualification of context: looking forward to the <I><FONT color=brown>job</FONT></I> of building the garage at weekends; dreading the exasperating <I><FONT color=brown>job</FONT></I> of filling in his income tax return. <I><FONT color=brown>Duty</FONT></I>, by contrast, stresses either an involuntary or unpleasant task or one that calls up devoted commitment or dedication: my reluctant <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I> to set your punishment; soldiers put on mess <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I>; the painful <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I> of sorting through his father’s effects; glad to undertake the <I><FONT color=brown>duty</FONT></I> of caring for the child in his wife’s absence.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Obligation">OBLIGATION</A>, <A href="entry://Profession">PROFESSION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hobby">HOBBY</A>.</P>

<P>These words denote the section of the human or other animal body between the diaphragm and the pelvic floor. <B><FONT color=blue>Stomach</FONT></B> is the most general term; it may simply mean the external region, although specifically it is applied to the internal digestive organ. As the seat of appetite or inclination, <I><FONT color=brown>stomach</FONT></I> is used figuratively, especially in a negative sense: to have no <I><FONT color=brown>stomach</FONT></I> for strong drink, to have no <I><FONT color=brown>stomach</FONT></I> for the business of killing.</P><P>In scientific terminology, <B><FONT color=blue>abdomen</FONT></B> is the word for both the external <I><FONT color=brown>stomach</FONT></I> and for the entire internal cavity containing the alimentary canal and other organs as well to open up an <I><FONT color=brown>abdomen</FONT></I> to remove a tumour; the enlarged <I><FONT color=brown>abdomen</FONT></I> of a woman in advanced pregnancy.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Belly</FONT></B> was once a standard word to refer to the same region, but was later euphemistically suppressed in favour of <I><FONT color=brown>stomach</FONT></I>, which is imprecise, and <I><FONT color=brown>abdomen</FONT></I>, which to some people is less acceptable because of its technical sound. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>belly</FONT></I> once meant "womb" or "uterus," as well as the organ which receives food. Perhaps for this reason it is jarring to some ears. From its original meaning of "bag," <I><FONT color=brown>belly</FONT></I> suggests both a hollow cavity and a protuberance: the <I><FONT color=brown>belly</FONT></I> of a sail; his little, round <I><FONT color=brown>belly</FONT></I> tightly buttoned into his trousers.</P><P>Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>stomach</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>belly</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>abdomen</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>guts</FONT></B> applies almost exclusively to the internal organs of the pelvic cavity. In the plural, it is a synonym for "entrails" or "intestines," and, in the singular, for the entire digestive system, especially that of an animal. <I><FONT color=brown>Guts</FONT></I> emphasizes the more earthy or even revolting aspects of the intestines when they are not functioning properly or have suffered injury: the sundowner’s <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I> growling with hunger; a horse in the bull ring with its <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I> hanging out. <I><FONT color=brown>Guts</FONT></I> has the slang, figurative meaning of courage or effrontery: to have the <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I> to cross a field under gunfire; to have the <I><FONT color=brown>guts</FONT></I> to insult the managing director of one?firm.</P><P>In order to avoid the technical or vulgar uses of the above words, <B><FONT color=blue>tummy</FONT></B> is very common in informal but polite contexts: Hold your <I><FONT color=brown>tummy</FONT></I> in; to have a <I><FONT color=brown>tummy</FONT></I> ache.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Courage">COURAGE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to open ways for public passage, particularly for the movement of vehicles rather than of pedestrians. <B><FONT color=blue>Street</FONT></B> is a generic term for all such public ways that lie within a town or city: the intersection of the two busiest <I><FONT color=brown>streets</FONT></I> in the neighbourhood. <B><FONT color=blue>Avenue</FONT></B> can sometimes be used more formally as a generic term similar to <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>avenues</FONT></I> are often wider, more important or more elegant <I><FONT color=brown>streets</FONT></I>: the famed <I><FONT color=brown>Avenue</FONT></I> des Champs-Elysées in Paris. Specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>avenue</FONT></I> can refer to a public way, usually in a residential suburb, that is not a through <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I> but that terminates in a T-intersection at both ends. The term is sometimes used loosely, however, to confer gentility on any sort of <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I> ?wide or narrow, through or closed ?in cases where <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I> itself would serve equally well. In the same way, <B><FONT color=blue>drive</FONT></B> is gaining in use as a more elegant substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Crescent</FONT></B> is a word with some distinctiveness, since it refers to a short, curving <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I> that leaves a roadway at one point to rejoins it farther on. <I><FONT color=brown>Avenue</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>drive</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>crescent</FONT></I> like can form part of the name of the <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I>, as in Seaview <I><FONT color=brown>Crescent</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lane</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>boulevard</FONT></B> indicate sharply contrasting kinds of <I><FONT color=brown>streets</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Lane</FONT></I> suggests a narrow, sometimes dead-end, <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I> behind or between buildings, that exists solely to permit egress for deliveries, pick-ups or the parking of vehicles: carrying out the garbage bins for collection in the <I><FONT color=brown>lane</FONT></I>. While the word may be perfectly neutral in this sense, it often has connotations of an unsavoury darkness, dankness or uncleanness: parks, rather than back <I><FONT color=brown>lanes</FONT></I>, for children to play in. Sometimes the word can be used with an affected quaintness for any <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I>, particularly a narrow one, even though it permits through traffic and is faced by buildings or houses: Henrietta <I><FONT color=brown>Lane</FONT></I>. While <I><FONT color=brown>boulevard</FONT></I> can be applied to any city <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I>, particularly a wide one, the word has connotations in sharp contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>lane</FONT></I>, suggesting a residential <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I> enhanced by greenery or a median strip containing grass and shrubbery: expensive houses facing on a landscaped <I><FONT color=brown>boulevard</FONT></I>.</P><P>The remaining words refer mostly to public ways outside of towns and cities. <B><FONT color=blue>Road</FONT></B> here is as informal and general as street and is often used as an alternative to <I><FONT color=brown>street</FONT></I> within towns, but it has an even wider range of connotation. The word can suggest anything from a dirt track for vehicles to the most modern and sophisticated <B><FONT color=blue>highway</FONT></B>. The latter now refers to any bitumen-surfaced or otherwise sealed <I><FONT color=brown>road</FONT></I> constructed for travelling motor vehicles: additional funds for building <I><FONT color=brown>roads</FONT></I>; small towns whose main <I><FONT color=brown>streets</FONT></I> are simply wider parts of the <I><FONT color=brown>highway</FONT></I>; turning off the main <I><FONT color=brown>highway</FONT></I> on to a winding gravel <I><FONT color=brown>road</FONT></I>. Unqualified, <I><FONT color=brown>highway</FONT></I> has few imponderable connotations; <I><FONT color=brown>road</FONT></I> has many. It can refer to any course that leads to a certain destination: the <I><FONT color=brown>road</FONT></I> to nuclear disaster.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Expressway</FONT></B> refers exclusively to a specific kind of <I><FONT color=brown>highway</FONT></I> with obvious connotations of rapid travel, made possible by a wide surface and by fly-overs and underpasses that eliminate traffic lights and intersections. <I><FONT color=brown>Expressways</FONT></I> are multi-laned and well lit; the better modern examples are pleasantly landscaped and free of advertising hoardings. Some, such as the Inter-City <I><FONT color=brown>Expressway</FONT></I> between Sydney and Newcastle, require the payment of a toll. <B><FONT color=blue>Motorway</FONT></B> is a term used in New Zealand to describe a city-access highway on which expressway conditions apply, i.e., prohibition of parking, controlled access, elimination of cross traffic because of specially designed junctions, and elimination of ribbon development. In Australia, a portion of a <I><FONT color=brown>highway</FONT></I> leading into a built-up city area may be declared a <B><FONT color=blue>clearway</FONT></B>, which, like <I><FONT color=brown>expressway</FONT></I>, carries connotations of rapid travel. A <I><FONT color=brown>clearway</FONT></I> retains its original cross intersections and traffic lights, but parking and even stopping (except by public-transport vehicles) are forbidden during peak hours.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Journey">JOURNEY</A>.</P>

stress
<B><FONT color=blue>stress</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pressure</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stain</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>tension</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are comparable in their denotation of the action or effect of a force upon a person or thing. The first term, <B><FONT color=blue>stress</FONT></B>, designates any force or combination of forces that acts on a body or part of a body, as by pressing, pushing, pulling, stretching, compressing or twisting, and by such action tends to cause a change in the shape or size of the body acted upon. When used in reference to a person, <I><FONT color=brown>stress</FONT></I> indicates a condition of emotional or intellectual distress. There is a suggestion in <I><FONT color=brown>stress</FONT></I> of some external stimulus, such as injury, worry or shock, that exerts a compelling or constraining influence to which the person involved cannot adequately adjust: a serious gastro-intestinal disorder that was the result of the <I><FONT color=brown>stress</FONT></I> of anxiety and grief.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stain</FONT></B> when used in relation to an object, denotes the change in shape or size of that object when it is acted upon by a <I><FONT color=brown>stress</FONT></I>. A suggestion of the natural resistance an object makes to the action of <I><FONT color=brown>stress</FONT></I> is carried over to the meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>strain</FONT></I> when it pertains to persons. Resistance implies effort, and a person undergoing <I><FONT color=brown>stain</FONT></I> is subject to the physical, mental or emotional distress that severe effort entails: the constant <I><FONT color=brown>strain</FONT></I> of trying to make ends meet on an inadequate wage; the <I><FONT color=brown>strain</FONT></I> of working while suffering from a painful back ailment.</P><P>In their application to inanimate things, <B><FONT color=blue>tension</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pressure</FONT></B> may be classified as types of <I><FONT color=brown>stresses</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Tension</FONT></I> is an elongating <I><FONT color=brown>stress</FONT></I> caused by a force that pulls or stretches an object in one direction. <I><FONT color=brown>Pressure</FONT></I> is a kind of stress characteristically produced by fluids; its special property is that its force is the same in all directions. In designating the condition of a person, <I><FONT color=brown>tension</FONT></I> hints at a state of mental <I><FONT color=brown>strain</FONT></I> whose peculiarity is its manifestation in physical distress, as in headaches or taut muscles: a tranquillizer to reduce nervous <I><FONT color=brown>tension</FONT></I> after an unsuccessful job interview. <I><FONT color=brown>Tension</FONT></I> has come popularly to denote also any state of <I><FONT color=brown>strained</FONT></I> relations like that caused by conflict or hostility between persons or groups of persons: the <I><FONT color=brown>tension</FONT></I> existing between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. <I><FONT color=brown>Pressure</FONT></I>, more than the other words in this group, specifically points to the things producing a state of <I><FONT color=brown>strain</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>tension</FONT></I> rather than to the state itself. It is a general word that can apply to anything from a minor and temporary difficulty to major, continuous misfortune: the <I><FONT color=brown>pressure</FONT></I> of a too-busy social schedule; job <I><FONT color=brown>pressure</FONT></I>; the <I><FONT color=brown>pressures</FONT></I> of poverty.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>, <A href="entry://Impact">IMPACT</A>, <A href="entry://Nervous">NERVOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Propel">PROPEL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to what is vigorous, well-built, durable or resistant to change or pressure. <B><FONT color=blue>Strong</FONT></B>, the most general, pertains to what has force or to what is rugged in construction or build: a <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> headwind; a <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> workbench; a <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> body. It can apply also to what is vigorous, intense, vivid or persuasive: a <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> government; a <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> tranquillizers, a painter who worked with <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> colours; a <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> argument against the proposal. At its most general, it is still relative, implying what is greater in degree than usual: a <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> suspicion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Powerful</FONT></B> can function as an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>powerful</FONT></I> argument. It can also indicate the ability to deliver great amounts of energy: a <I><FONT color=brown>powerful</FONT></I> turbine; a <I><FONT color=brown>powerful</FONT></I> nuclear bomb. It can particularly suggest the considerable ability to overcome resistance or opposition: a <I><FONT color=brown>powerful</FONT></I> fighter against oppression; a <I><FONT color=brown>powerful</FONT></I> army. Where powerful can be used to refer to someone who is physically <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I>, muscular is almost exclusively limited to this application, specifically suggesting a <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I>, well-built body; a <I><FONT color=brown>muscular</FONT></I> athlete. Of these three words, only <I><FONT color=brown>powerful</FONT></I> necessarily indicates an absolute capacity for applying considerable force: pioneer women who proved to be nearly as <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I> as the men they accompanied into the outback; <I><FONT color=brown>powerful</FONT></I> arms that enabled him to use a sledge-hammer as though it were a straw; a <I><FONT color=brown>muscular</FONT></I> weight-lifter who couldn’t have fought his way out of a paper bag.</P><P>In contrast to the foregoing, <B><FONT color=blue>sturdy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>hardy</FONT></B> both refer more strictly to what is durable or resistant to change or pressure. But <I><FONT color=brown>sturdy</FONT></I>, like one sense of <I><FONT color=brown>strong</FONT></I>, can refer to what is well built as well: a <I><FONT color=brown>sturdy</FONT></I> footbridge that could easily support the weight of a small truck. When applied to physique, the word suggests solidity without necessarily implying the development indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>muscular</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>sturdy</FONT></I> young boy. <I><FONT color=brown>Hardy</FONT></I> emphasizes the ability to withstand force or adversity. It is typically applied to strains of plants or animals: a <I><FONT color=brown>hardy</FONT></I> species of wheat that was unaffected by the near-drought conditions; sled dogs <I><FONT color=brown>hardy</FONT></I> enough to withstand the antarctic weather. In application to people, it can refer to someone able to survive difficulty or to a difficult way of life itself: the <I><FONT color=brown>hardy</FONT></I> life of a timber-cutter.</P><P>At its most restricted, <B><FONT color=blue>tough</FONT></B> can indicate a surface or covering that is thick, dense, horny or callous ?a surface that is impervious to wear or damage: the <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I> hide of the crocodile. More informally, the word can apply to physical or mental strength or stamina, with an added implication at times of coarseness or brutality: <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I>, well-trained recruits; <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I>-minded on economic questions; the <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I> bouncers that many dance halls employ. Even more informally, <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I> can refer to what is difficult: a <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I> problem. <B><FONT color=blue>Stalwart</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words; nowadays it points more to qualities of courage and loyalty than to physical strength per se: <I><FONT color=brown>stalwart</FONT></I> Maori warriors; one of his most <I><FONT color=brown>stalwart</FONT></I> political supporters.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Healthy">HEALTHY</A>, <A href="entry://Husky">HUSKY</A>, <A href="entry://Massive">MASSIVE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Powerless">POWERLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Weak">WEAK</A>.</P>

<P>All these words suggest a tendency to persist in an opinion, belief, decision or course of action, generally with more force than reason. A person may be <B><FONT color=blue>stubborn</FONT></B> by disposition, showing this quality in most of his behaviour and in most situations, but may be <B><FONT color=blue>obstinate</FONT></B> in a particular instance: Dick had always been a very <I><FONT color=brown>stubborn</FONT></I> boy, but was particularly <I><FONT color=brown>obstinate</FONT></I> in his dislike of homework. <B><FONT color=blue>Pigheaded</FONT></B> usually suggests <I><FONT color=brown>obstinate</FONT></I> stupidity: His <I><FONT color=brown>pigheaded</FONT></I> refusal to accept facts makes discussion impossible. <B><FONT color=blue>Adamant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>inflexible</FONT></B> imply a hard and unyielding attitude that may be the result of a strongly felt or carefully thought out conviction regarding some important matter: The ambassador was <I><FONT color=brown>adamant</FONT></I> in his insistence that all the prisoners be released from the concentration camp. <I><FONT color=brown>Inflexible</FONT></I> suggests more of an unwillingness to change one’s mind and usually carries notions of the foolish firmness implied by the more pejorative <I><FONT color=brown>pigheaded</FONT></I>: He remained <I><FONT color=brown>inflexible</FONT></I> even when the wisdom of changing his mind must have been obvious. A similar attitude, but carrying the idea of harshness and a lack of felling, is implied by <I><FONT color=brown>obdurate</FONT></I>: The foreman was <I><FONT color=brown>obdurate</FONT></I> in holding to rigid production schedules. Both <I><FONT color=brown>adamant</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>obdurate</FONT></I> can point approvingly to principled refusal to compromise, unlike these other words with their implications of arbitrary egocentricity.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pertinacious</FONT></B>, though not necessarily deprecatory, usually suggests a kind of perseverance in a course of action that can be annoying or seem unreasonable to others: The lawyer’s <I><FONT color=brown>pertinacious</FONT></I> harping on the same point made the witness very nervous under cross-examination. <B><FONT color=blue>Headstrong</FONT></B> indicates a strong-willed self-direction and an impatience with restraint. A <I><FONT color=brown>headstrong</FONT></I> person cannot be held back by advice or argument and may be reckless or hotheaded in his actions: a <I><FONT color=brown>headstrong</FONT></I> impetuous youth, rushing into things without forethought; His <I><FONT color=brown>headstrong</FONT></I> attempt to seize control of the party was political suicide.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Authoritarian">AUTHORITARIAN</A>, <A href="entry://Overbearing">OVERBEARING</A>, <A href="entry://Persistent">PERSISTENT</A>, <A href="entry://Unruly">UNRULY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adaptable">ADAPTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Compliant">COMPLIANT</A>, <A href="entry://Docile">DOCILE</A>, <A href="entry://Malleable">MALLEABLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to someone involved in studies, in attempting to gain a set of skills, or in devotion to a patron or master. <B><FONT color=blue>Student</FONT></B> is the most general word here for any such person. At its most specific, it forms a complementary pair with <B><FONT color=blue>pupil</FONT></B>. The latter now usually refer to a young person in primary or secondary school, while <I><FONT color=brown>student</FONT></I>, in this context, refers to one in a university or technical college. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>pupil</FONT></I> itself has few uses outside this situation, <I><FONT color=brown>student</FONT></I> can displace <I><FONT color=brown>pupil</FONT></I> on the one hand and refer on the other to the most advanced or specialized expert or authority in some field: a musicologist who was a keen <I><FONT color=brown>student</FONT></I> of Beethoven’s later work.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scholar</FONT></B> can function as a more formal substitute for student, but the word is unique in having two special areas of relevance. <I><FONT color=brown>Scholar</FONT></I> may be used at any level for <I><FONT color=brown>student</FONT></I> who continues with, and usually excels in, his studies: an unruly child who nevertheless turned out to be a real <I><FONT color=brown>scholar</FONT></I>. More often, the word refers specifically to an advanced specialist, without any suggestion that the person is still pursuing a course of formal education; the word, in fact, may suggest an extremely learned authority on a given subject: <I><FONT color=brown>scholars</FONT></I> who were able to test the theory by collating all existing copies of the folio text of the play. <B><FONT color=blue>Learner</FONT></B> is much more informal than <I><FONT color=brown>scholar</FONT></I> and emphasizes the other extreme ?a beginner rather than an authority in some field of knowledge. Furthermore, the word applies less to youngsters than to adults who are purposely acquiring some new set of possibly simple skills. The situation pertains not so much to someone seeking formal education as to any sort of novice or beginner: insisting that she have a <I><FONT color=brown>learner’s</FONT></I> permit before he attempted to teach her how to drive; a <I><FONT color=brown>learner</FONT></I> in a shearing shed.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disciple</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>protégé</FONT></B> both pertain exclusively to someone devoted to a master or patron. Most strictly, disciple suggests a religious situation: the <I><FONT color=brown>disciples</FONT></I> of Buddha who codified his writings; the twelve <I><FONT color=brown>disciples</FONT></I> of Christ. In general use, the word refers to someone’s ardent advocacy of any prominent figure or theory: an early <I><FONT color=brown>disciple</FONT></I> of Freud, though never of Freudianism per se. Often, the word has a contemptuous ring to it, suggesting someone subordinate or unimportant in himself, possibly because of his slavish devotion to or imitation of another: teenagers who become overnight <I><FONT color=brown>disciples</FONT></I> of the newest singing sensation; business executives who pick yes-men to be their <I><FONT color=brown>disciples</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Protégé</FONT></I> indicates a situation in striking contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>disciple</FONT></I>. Here, a young or unknown person of talent is assisted or patronized by someone else who is securely established, either as an artist or merely as a person of financial means: a wealthy benefactor who demanded nothing whatsoever in return for the money he spent on his <I><FONT color=brown>protégés</FONT></I>; a master sculptor who, seeing the boy’s talent, took him on as a <I><FONT color=brown>protégé</FONT></I>. The word can have a contemptuous ting to it, like <I><FONT color=brown>disciple</FONT></I>. In this case it may suggest even greater servility in the subordinate but adds to this suggestion of over-weaning vanity in the superior or benefactor; the word can even be a euphemism for a paid mistress or lover, particularly one younger than the benefactor.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Beginner">BEGINNER</A>, <A href="entry://Learning">LEARNING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: master, patron, <A href="entry://Professor">PROFESSOR</A>, teacher.</P>

<P>These words refer to a lack of intellect, perceptivity or wisdom. <B><FONT color=blue>Stupid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>asinine</FONT></B> are the harshest of these and are more likely to be used to disapprove of rather than to describe someone. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>stupid</FONT></I> may suggest either a weak mentality or foolish behaviour, <I><FONT color=brown>asinine</FONT></I> is most often restricted to the latter: a <I><FONT color=brown>stupid</FONT></I> fellow; a <I><FONT color=brown>stupid</FONT></I> mistake; an <I><FONT color=brown>asinine</FONT></I> middle-aged woman dressing like a teenager. Because of this limitation, <I><FONT color=brown>asinine</FONT></I> is even more disapproving than <I><FONT color=brown>stupid</FONT></I>; its reference is to a beast of burden, the ass, traditionally considered <I><FONT color=brown>stupid</FONT></I> and obstinate.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dense</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>thick</FONT></B> both concentrate on the aspect of stupid pertaining to a weak mentality, both emphasizing an inability to understand simple facts or remember clear instructions. <I><FONT color=brown>Thick</FONT></I> may sound more informal, but it is also less harsh than <I><FONT color=brown>dense</FONT></I>, which suggests an impenetrable quality of mind. Also, thick may apply to a single instance, while <I><FONT color=brown>dense</FONT></I> more often refers to a rooted characteristic: a bit <I><FONT color=brown>thick</FONT></I>; so <I><FONT color=brown>dense</FONT></I> that he had to be talked to like a child.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dumb</FONT></B> in this sense is restricted to an extremely informal level when applied to <I><FONT color=brown>stupid</FONT></I> people: a <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I> blonde; a <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I> cluck. Purists frown on it in this use, because it means mute in other situations: the deaf and <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>dumb</FONT></I> animals. <B><FONT color=blue>Obtuse</FONT></B>, by contrast, is perhaps the most formal word here, referring to slow-wittedness, whether revealed by a particular act or by a person’s whole character: a laughably <I><FONT color=brown>obtuse</FONT></I> misunderstanding of her request; an <I><FONT color=brown>asinine</FONT></I> television show that was specifically designed for the ignorant and <I><FONT color=brown>obtuse</FONT></I>. While the word may seem more objective at first glance, its very formality adds a note of withering scorn that is not present in the previous words.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dull</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unintelligent</FONT></B> are both used more objectively to describe people or behaviour revealing low mental ability. Unintelligent, in fact, is almost completely devoid of emotional connotations: <I><FONT color=brown>unintelligent</FONT></I> answers to complex questions. Since mental ability is a matter of degree, the word may mask subjective judgement, except when used comparatively: gearing her lessons to the more <I><FONT color=brown>unintelligent</FONT></I> among her pupils. <I><FONT color=brown>Dull</FONT></I> can be used to express simple disapproval of the <I><FONT color=brown>stupid</FONT></I> and boring: The party was too <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I> for words; a <I><FONT color=brown>dull</FONT></I>-witted fool. The word is often used more objectively to refer to less than average mentality, and sometimes it serves as a euphemism for the more straightforward <I><FONT color=brown>unintelligent</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Backward</FONT></B> is used in a similar way. <B><FONT color=blue>Slow</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>retarded</FONT></B>, too, can be regarded as euphemisms for lack of intelligence: a special class for <I><FONT color=brown>slow</FONT></I> learners; intellectually <I><FONT color=brown>retarded</FONT></I>. These terms also describe children who have been deprived of educational opportunity at some stage or who suffer from some physical disability that prevents normal progress in one or more skills.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Blockhead">BLOCKHEAD</A>, <A href="entry://Monotonous">MONOTONOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Moron">MORON</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bright">BRIGHT</A>, clever, <A href="entry://Creative">CREATIVE</A>, intelligent, <A href="entry://Keen">KEEN</A>, smart.</P>

<P>These words refer to uncertain or unsteady speech. <B><FONT color=blue>Stutter</FONT></B> is the most concrete and technical of these, referring to a chronic speech defect in which there is spasmodic repetition, blocking, prolongation of sounds and syllables, especially of initial ones; such a defect may have an organic or physiological element, but is mainly caused by a psychological disruption of normal development: therapeutic and remedial training for children who <I><FONT color=brown>stutter</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Stammer</FONT></B> may suggest a milder degree of speech difficulty, such as halting speech, or it may apply more widely to any temporary or momentary difficulty in speaking that stems from shyness, uncertainty or any excess of emotion: blushing and <I><FONT color=brown>stammering</FONT></I> under the attractive man’s searching glance; <I><FONT color=brown>stammering</FONT></I> that he didn’t know where he had put his keys; finally able to <I><FONT color=brown>stammer</FONT></I> out how much she loved him. Sometimes the word can be used in a euphemistic way to replace what may be thought of as the harsh directness of <I><FONT color=brown>stutter</FONT></I>: assuring him that many a child <I><FONT color=brown>stammered</FONT></I> a bit and that it would go away if he didn’t think about it.</P><P>Whereas the previous pair emphasize an involuntary difficulty, <B><FONT color=blue>hem</FONT></B> (which is rare) and <B><FONT color=blue>hum and haw</FONT></B> more often suggest a deliberate reluctance to state something directly. Thus, while the words can suggest the embarrassed or halting manner of <I><FONT color=brown>stammer</FONT></I>, they more often point to someone trying to avoid answering a question or buying time until the right reply occurs to him: a question that was so surprising that he could only <I><FONT color=brown>hum and haw</FONT></I> in answer. As the amount of suggested evasiveness increases, <I><FONT color=brown>hum and haw</FONT></I> can point also to someone who speaks in a slow but more particularly a roundabout or evasive manner: <I><FONT color=brown>humming and hawing</FONT></I> about generalities instead of explaining the statistics I had cited. <B><FONT color=blue>Stumble</FONT></B> is more like <I><FONT color=brown>stammer</FONT></I> in suggesting a temporarily halting speech that is involuntary: <I><FONT color=brown>stumbling</FONT></I> over his words in his haste to tell the whole story. The reason here may be the same as for <I><FONT color=brown>stammer</FONT></I>; but the word can once or twice in a very long speech.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Timid">TIMID</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: articulate, enunciate.</P>

<P>These words refer to grooming and clothes that are fastidious, elegant, well designed or in accordance with current taste. <B><FONT color=blue>Stylish</FONT></B> emphasizes something designed and executed so as to display a trend-setting flair for what is in vogue. In this it is close to <B><FONT color=blue>fashionable</FONT></B>, but is less formal, the minute standards. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>fashionable</FONT></I> emphasizes elegance, correctness and possibly a simplicity of expensive taste that is not likely to become dated so quickly: Leopard coats were <I><FONT color=brown>stylish</FONT></I> for a season, but mink coats will always be <I><FONT color=brown>fashionable</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Stylish</FONT></I> is also more open to being used as a contemptuous term: elaborate hair-dos and other <I><FONT color=brown>stylish</FONT></I> vulgarities. <I><FONT color=brown>Fashionable</FONT></I> can be applied also to transitory or disapproved-of vogues: the sack, stretch slacks, the maxi-skirt all having had their <I><FONT color=brown>fashionable</FONT></I>, brief moment of glory. <I><FONT color=brown>Fashionable</FONT></I>, furthermore, is more likely to be applied to men than stylish: the double-breasted suit that could again become <I><FONT color=brown>fashionable</FONT></I>. Used of men, <I><FONT color=brown>stylish</FONT></I> is likely to suggest a specialized subculture when it is not openly contemptuous: the <I><FONT color=brown>stylish</FONT></I>, bowler-hatted businessmen in the City of London; the dirty jeans and leather jacket that are thought <I><FONT color=brown>stylish</FONT></I> among motor-cycle cultists.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chic</FONT></B> is in every way an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>stylish</FONT></I>, except for its greater formality. Its French flavour points to that country as a source of high fashion for Western women, a fact emphasized by the word’s restriction to female grooming. If anything, the word suggests not only a great concern for the last word modernity, with a special emphasis on the exclusive and expensive, but also an acute awareness of what best enhances individual qualities: Her entire outfit was so <I><FONT color=brown>chic</FONT></I> as to make even the other fashionable women seem commonplace.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Modish</FONT></B> sometimes concentrates on the negative aspects of <I><FONT color=brown>stylish</FONT></I>, suggesting a concern with vogue to the neglect of good taste, comfort or decorum: women who looked like colourless cadavers in their modish chalk-white make-up and silver lame dresses. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>smart</FONT></B> concentrates on a different aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>stylish</FONT></I>, referring to the dramatic impact of good design. <I><FONT color=brown>Smart</FONT></I> puts less emphasis on vogue than any of the previous words, and suggests instead the boldness of clean lines and simple cut, particularly those conceived of as being suitable for a specific occasion: her <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I> riding outfit. Where <I><FONT color=brown>chic</FONT></I> suggests the apex of femininity, there is something of the opposite in <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I>, although its forcefulness need not suggest mannishness. The word does tend to emphasize overall appearance rather than any one isolated aspect. <I><FONT color=brown>Smart</FONT></I>, of course, can refer also to comparable aspects of male grooming without suggesting effeminacy: his <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I> Italian-style suit. This versatility makes the word useful in joint descriptions: a <I><FONT color=brown>smart</FONT></I>, well-turned-out couple.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dapper</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>spruce</FONT></B>, by contrast with the previous words, are mainly reserved to describe aspects of male grooming. <I><FONT color=brown>Dapper</FONT></I> may indicate the last word in formality and correctness: looking <I><FONT color=brown>dapper</FONT></I> in his new dinner suit. More often, however, the word suggests over-elegant and even prissy grooming: quipping that he reminded her of the <I><FONT color=brown>dapper</FONT></I> little gentleman on wedding cakes. <I><FONT color=brown>Spruce</FONT></I> suggests masculine neatness and cleanness, with an emphasis on simplicity and timeless correctness of costume rather than conformity to fashionable vogues: sailors looking <I><FONT color=brown>spruce</FONT></I> and trim in their uniforms. Also, more than any other word here, <I><FONT color=brown>spruce</FONT></I> often bears directly on grooming to the exclusion of dress: looking <I><FONT color=brown>spruce</FONT></I> and clean-shaven. Occasionally, the word can refer to a woman’s costume; in this case, it emphasizes trimness and neatness: her <I><FONT color=brown>spruce</FONT></I> skiing outfit.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Artistic">ARTISTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Elegant">ELEGANT</A>, <A href="entry://Exquisite">EXQUISITE</A>, <A href="entry://Modern">MODERN</A>, <A href="entry://Orderly">ORDERLY</A>, UP-TO-DATE, <A href="entry://Vogue">VOGUE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dowdy, OLD-FASHIONED, <A href="entry://Ugly">UGLY</A>, unkempt.</P>

<P>These words refer to expression or behaviour that is concerned with sexuality or bodily functions. <B><FONT color=blue>Suggestive</FONT></B> is the milder of these words, emphasizing not frankness on these matters so much as allusions or innuendoes that are considered to be in bad taste: <I><FONT color=brown>suggestive</FONT></I> motion-picture advertisements that are more titillating than the films they publicize. Even so distant an approach to frankness as this word can imply was once condemned by an earlier age; now the word can be used in disapproval of any leering indirectness about sex, even those cases where frankness itself might now be thought quite innocuous: the sort of parental lecture on the facts of life that is, its embarrassed delivery, bewildering and <I><FONT color=brown>suggestive</FONT></I> rather than dispassionate and informative.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Risqué</FONT></B> suggests a closer approach to frankness on sexual matters in that boldness of allusion is stressed. Except for someone who is extremely strait-laced, this word has fewer legitimate uses in today’s more tolerant atmosphere, since many kinds of direct references to sex (much less glancing allusions of any sort) are not thought particularly bold: It was once thought <I><FONT color=brown>risqué</FONT></I> for a woman to dine along with a man in his flat; gentlemen who traded <I><FONT color=brown>risqué</FONT></I> jokes once the ladies had retired after dinner.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Off-colour</FONT></B> has been similarly affected, although its vagueness still permits its application, particularly to jokes of any sort that hinge on sexual matters: an <I><FONT color=brown>off-colour</FONT></I> joke that was currently making the rounds of the girls?dormitory. But "dirty joke" is a more common description of this kind of humour.</P><P>The remaining words are not restricted to sexuality alone. Of these, <B><FONT color=blue>earthy</FONT></B> is the broadest in application. If once it was disapproving for something coarse or crude in reference to sexual and bodily functions, now it may be descriptively neutral or even approving: the <I><FONT color=brown>earthy</FONT></I> humour of Chaucer and Shakespeare. The word may even suggest a sentimental nostalgia for the supposedly simpler and more direct life that man lived in earlier, less complex times: the trend to urbanization that has robbed man of his <I><FONT color=brown>earthy</FONT></I> acceptance of the natural processes of birth, copulation, death and decay.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Racy</FONT></B> can apply to accounts that are erotic, pornographic or <I><FONT color=brown>earthy</FONT></I>, but in this case the word suggests fast-paced action and a linguistic forcefulness gained through frank and direct expressions: a <I><FONT color=brown>racy</FONT></I> book about marital infidelity in the suburbs. When <I><FONT color=brown>racy</FONT></I> applies to actions it can indicate <I><FONT color=brown>earthy</FONT></I> behaviour that is marked by high-spirited energy and linguistic gusto: a character whose <I><FONT color=brown>racy</FONT></I>, pungent speech and erotic prowess would have put Don Juan to shame.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>rabelaisian</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>scatological</FONT></B> emphasize <I><FONT color=brown>earthy</FONT></I> expression or behaviour. <I><FONT color=brown>Rabelaisian</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>racy</FONT></I>, indicates high-spirited zest, but stresses with sexual and excretory functions. The word refers to the French writer, Rabelais, whose work reflected such concerns: the <I><FONT color=brown>Rabelaisian</FONT></I> wit of many contemporary novelists; a <I><FONT color=brown>Rabelaisian</FONT></I> rascal who delighted in playing obscene practical jokes on his friends. <I><FONT color=brown>Scatological</FONT></I> is a word of neutral description for a fascination with excrement or with the excretory functions. It is useful in discriminating work with this emphasis from other possibly obscene material that is focused on sexual functions: the <I><FONT color=brown>scatological</FONT></I> emphasis in the works of Jonathan Swift; soldiers whose language is larded with obscene and <I><FONT color=brown>scatological</FONT></I> references.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Erotic">EROTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Indecent">INDECENT</A>, <A href="entry://Lewd">LEWD</A>, <A href="entry://Smutty">SMUTTY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bland">BLAND</A>, decorous, genteel, <A href="entry://Innocent">INNOCENT</A>, prissy.</P>

<P>These words refer to a short description of the main points of a longer work or presentation. <B><FONT color=blue>Summary</FONT></B> is the most general, referring to any attempt to condense into as few words as possible an extended train of thought: a day-to-day <I><FONT color=brown>summary</FONT></I> of the proceedings in the murder trial; concluding each chapter with a <I><FONT color=brown>summary</FONT></I> of its main arguments. The word implies a pithy paraphrase, with no attempt to catch the style of the original. Also, the word almost exclusively refers to something that follows after and is based on the extended presentation, or even concludes it ?as suggested by the common phrase in speechmaking: in <I><FONT color=brown>summary</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Abstract</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>précis</FONT></B> both refer to <I><FONT color=brown>summaries</FONT></I> written most often by someone other than the original author; hence they are seldom part of the original presentation, though they follow it and are based upon it. Like <I><FONT color=brown>summary</FONT></I>, they stress brevity and the schematic representation of essential points with no attempt to preserve flavour. <I><FONT color=brown>Abstract</FONT></I> most specifically refers to a scholarly or legal citation that gives the gist of what may be a complex argument or study: a quarterly containing <I><FONT color=brown>abstracts</FONT></I> of doctoral dissertations in progress; an <I><FONT color=brown>abstract</FONT></I> of the proposed legislation. <I><FONT color=brown>Précis</FONT></I> may suggest a lengthier treatment than <I><FONT color=brown>abstract</FONT></I> and one in which the exact order of points in the original is adhered to; also, it is not restricted to legal or scholarly fields but applies to any <I><FONT color=brown>summary</FONT></I> of thought or argument in an essay or other non-fiction prose: each sentence in the <I><FONT color=brown>précis</FONT></I> representing a paragraph in the essay; The amount of space allotted was sufficient for <I><FONT color=brown>abstracts</FONT></I> but insufficient for <I><FONT color=brown>précis</FONT></I> of research projects. The word can even refer to a skeletal list-like presentation of whole fields of knowledge: a <I><FONT color=brown>précis</FONT></I> of Renaissance art history.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Outline</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>synopsis</FONT></B> relate to <I><FONT color=brown>précis</FONT></I> in that they both pertain the point-by-point ordering of the original; they are both most often a skeletal setting down of these points, but may be drawn up either by the author or someone else before, as well as after, the writing of the original. Within these possibilities, <I><FONT color=brown>outline</FONT></I> covers a wider range than <I><FONT color=brown>synopsis</FONT></I>. It often suggests a numbered and lettered list which may contain nothing more than key words or phrases, but which may, on the other hand, present an extended prose paraphrase: a <I><FONT color=brown>summary</FONT></I> of French history written in the form of an <I><FONT color=brown>outline</FONT></I>; drawing up an <I><FONT color=brown>outline</FONT></I> of the author’s arguments. <I><FONT color=brown>Synopsis</FONT></I> usually refers to a plot <I><FONT color=brown>summary</FONT></I> of a piece of fiction. Ordinary prose sentences are most often used, rather than the numbered and lettered list suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>outline</FONT></I>. It may specify, in capsule form, events treated in a completed work or those planned for a projected work: submitting the first chapter of his novel and <I><FONT color=brown>synopsis</FONT></I> of the unwritten remainder; writing <I><FONT color=brown>synopses</FONT></I> of novels to be considered for film treatment. The word may also refer to a paragraph that retells previous action and introduces an installment of a serialized work of fiction.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abridgement</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>digest</FONT></B> refer to more expanded treatment, suggesting condensation rather than a capsule paraphrase of the original. Consequently, what is presented after this shortening process may still be substantially in the original author’s own words and style. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>abridgement</FONT></I> suggests the least modification of the original; it may refer, in fact, merely to the excision of a relatively few passages: an <I><FONT color=brown>abridgement</FONT></I> in which passages involving sexual frankness were omitted. The word can indicate a greater amount of change: several characters and the whole sub-plot that did not appear in the <I><FONT color=brown>abridgement</FONT></I>; a useful one-volume <I><FONT color=brown>abridgement</FONT></I> of Gibbon. <I><FONT color=brown>Digest</FONT></I> refers to a boiled-down recasting of the original to present its essentials in shorter space. Although the original author’s style and flavour may be retained at times, other passages may be rewritten on grounds of clarity or brevity: a concise <I><FONT color=brown>digest</FONT></I> of the judge’s long dissent. The word may refer also to a collection of condensed some scholarly or technical uses, the word may suggest the sort of brevity implicit in abstract: a <I><FONT color=brown>digest</FONT></I> of all the papers presented at the annual medical convention.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Shorten">SHORTEN</A>, <A href="entry://Terse">TERSE</A>.</P>

summit

<P>These words refer to the highest point of something. <B><FONT color=blue>Summit</FONT></B> and peak both refer most concretely to mountains; <B><FONT color=blue>peak</FONT></B>, however, can indicate the whole mountain or its upper part whereas <I><FONT color=brown>summit</FONT></I> is specifically restricted in reference to the topmost surface alone: climbing the <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I> to reach the summit. In metaphorical use, this distinction is lost, both words referring to the position of greatest importance, intensity or power. <I><FONT color=brown>Summit</FONT></I> is the more formal of the two and has come to refer specifically to high-level conferences, as between heads of state: the settling of nuclear policy at the <I><FONT color=brown>summit</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Peak</FONT></I> suggests that point or moment at which something is most typical or at its best: when the Roaring Twenties were at their <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I>; a book produced when he was at the <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I> of his powers. <I><FONT color=brown>Summit</FONT></I> is less often used in this metaphorical way.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pinnacle</FONT></B> can refer to a turret or, more commonly, to a <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I> or its <I><FONT color=brown>summit</FONT></I>, but it may sometimes suggest a leaner, taller silhouette than <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I>. Used metaphorically, it functions as a hyperbolic substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I>, often in stock combinations that approach the cliché: the <I><FONT color=brown>pinnacle</FONT></I> of success. <B><FONT color=blue>Acme</FONT></B> can theoretically refer to a <I><FONT color=brown>summit</FONT></I> but is now used almost exclusively in a metaphorical way to refer to the quintessence of some abstract quality. It appears also in stock combinations: the <I><FONT color=brown>acme</FONT></I> of perfection. <B><FONT color=blue>Apex</FONT></B> refers to the vertex of an angle, but can indicate also the tip or top of something, or something at its maximum or its turning point: a battle that reached its <I><FONT color=brown>apex</FONT></I> the next afternoon. All three words can become empty metaphors, especially when used indiscriminately because of their imagined status or elegance.</P><P>Neither <B><FONT color=blue>zenith</FONT></B> nor <B><FONT color=blue>climax</FONT></B> makes any literal reference to a mountain <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>summit</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Zenith</FONT></I> refers to the celestial point directly overhead. Metaphorically, it suggests anything at its culmination or highest development; as such it is a useful intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I>: fearing that the team would reach its <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I> too early, before the competition had reached its <I><FONT color=brown>zenith</FONT></I>. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>zenith</FONT></I> is more often used or suggest something positive, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I> is not so restricted: His mastery of new painting techniques was at its <I><FONT color=brown>zenith</FONT></I> when the taste of his times had reached a <I><FONT color=brown>peak</FONT></I> of vulgarity. Most concretely, <I><FONT color=brown>climax</FONT></I> refers to the turning point of a play or a kind of rhetorical build-up in an oration. Metaphorically, the word is especially pertinent to indicate the point of fullest development in something that grows or has cyclic stages: The emergence of the butterfly from the chrysalis is the <I><FONT color=brown>climax</FONT></I> of its life cycle.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conclusive">CONCLUSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Final">FINAL</A>, <A href="entry://Highest">HIGHEST</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: base, bottom, foot, nadir.</P>

<P>These words refer to an appeal for help, a mustering of forces or resources, or a request for a group or a person to gather draw near. The most general of these words are the relatively formal <B><FONT color=blue>summon</FONT></B> and the informal phrase <B><FONT color=blue>send for</FONT></B>. Since neither word indicates what means are used to make the request, both can be convenient with when only the request itself is of importance or when a variety of means is used in a gathering process. [The dying man <I><FONT color=brown>sent for</FONT></I> his only son, who was waiting outside the sick-room; The Government members were <I><FONT color=brown>summoned</FONT></I> to an emergency meeting by the Party Whip, who had been ordered to track down every member by any means available.] <I><FONT color=brown>Summon</FONT></I> often implies an official or formal request or demand that someone come or appear: The Pope <I><FONT color=brown>summoned</FONT></I> all cardinals and bishops to the ecumenical council. The word can apply also to a mustering of forces or resources: an attempt to <I><FONT color=brown>summon</FONT></I> his last reserves of strength as he entered the last lap of the race. <I><FONT color=brown>Send for</FONT></I> often implies the delegation of a task: We stayed in our hotel room and <I><FONT color=brown>sent</FONT></I> out <I><FONT color=brown>for</FONT></I> food. The noun form of <I><FONT color=brown>summon</FONT></I> can also refer specifically to a notice to appear in court: served with a <I><FONT color=brown>summons</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Subpoena</FONT></B>, both as verb and noun, is exclusively restricted to this sense: Both sides in a case may <I><FONT color=brown>subpoena</FONT></I> witnesses to give evidence.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Call</FONT></B> can specifically indicate a <I><FONT color=brown>summoning</FONT></I> of someone by means of the spoken word or a vocal exclamation: He <I><FONT color=brown>called</FONT></I> to her from the other side of the street; the wordless wail with which she <I><FONT color=brown>called</FONT></I> for help. In other uses, the word can refer to paying a visit or the arrival of an escort: a friend who promised to <I><FONT color=brown>call</FONT></I> on us; the hour at which he would <I><FONT color=brown>call</FONT></I> for her. More pertinent here, <I><FONT color=brown>call</FONT></I> can indicate the expression of a recommendation or demand: a biting speech in which he <I><FONT color=brown>called</FONT></I> for a new approach to road safety. With "up," the word can indicate the <I><FONT color=brown>summoning</FONT></I> of eligible young men for national-service training: Three boys in our street or recollections ?or to making nay imaginative notion real and vivid by describing it in detail: a face that <I><FONT color=brown>called</FONT></I> up in his mind the image of his dead wife; He <I><FONT color=brown>called</FONT></I> up for his audience a vision of what the country might look like if the city planners were ignored. <U>Call</U> has a wide range of uses, often involved literally or metaphorically in some reference to a <I><FONT color=brown>summoning</FONT></I> process.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Beckon</FONT></B> specifically refers to any <I><FONT color=brown>summoning</FONT></I> done by a gesture of the hand: beckoning me to his side; She asked them to follow her and <I><FONT color=brown>beckoned</FONT></I> them forward. <B><FONT color=blue>Conjure</FONT></B>, like one use of <I><FONT color=brown>call</FONT></I>, can specifically indicate the <I><FONT color=brown>summoning</FONT></I> of spirits or recollections, but it more often refers, like the same use of <I><FONT color=brown>call</FONT></I>, to vivid descriptions of an imagined state: a house that <I><FONT color=brown>conjured</FONT></I> up his own forgotten childhood; a speech in the House in which he <I><FONT color=brown>conjured</FONT></I> up the grisly spectre of nuclear war. <B><FONT color=blue>Invoke</FONT></B> can refer to a <I><FONT color=brown>call</FONT></I> for supernatural favour, particularly at the opening of a formal or official gathering: the minister who <I><FONT color=brown>invoked</FONT></I> God to guide the convention in its real or imaginary, tangible or intangible, is called into play: a plea for the proposal in which he <I><FONT color=brown>invoked</FONT></I> the memory of the late mayor; They <I><FONT color=brown>invoked</FONT></I> the mounting evidence of discrepancies in the report as justifying a new investigation.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Gather">GATHER</A>, <A href="entry://Name">NAME</A>, <A href="entry://Plead">PLEAD</A>, <A href="entry://Request">REQUEST</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dismiss, <A href="entry://Postpone">POSTPONE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things and occurrences that are, or seem to be, breaks with the natural order, or unexplainable departures from ordinary reality. <B><FONT color=blue>Supernatural</FONT></B> would seem unambiguous in referring to anything that is literally "beyond nature" or cannot be explained by commonsense experience or the scientific method, especially to phenomena of a divine or heavenly character. Nevertheless, some people would exclude the possibility of such phenomena, and, to them, <I><FONT color=brown>supernatural</FONT></I> might be used to express scepticism or disbelief: priestly hocus-pocus and <I><FONT color=brown>supernatural</FONT></I> rigmarole. Furthermore, <I><FONT color=brown>supernatural</FONT></I> has gathered suggestions that make it particularly relevant to the context of occultists and spiritualists. Since many believers would find such interests heterodox, this flavour of the word restricts its use in a more general religious sense.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Magical</FONT></B> has far less complicated implications; now it refers strictly to acts or things believed to confer <I><FONT color=brown>supernatural</FONT></I> powers: a <I><FONT color=brown>magical</FONT></I> charm to drive away evil spirits. This meaning makes it useful to anthropologists to describe aspects of primitive cultures whose religion is animist. More loosely, the word may refer hyperbolically to anything charged with meaning and emotion, or which is awe-inspiring: the <I><FONT color=brown>magical</FONT></I> moment when the earth became visible to the orbiting astronauts. <B><FONT color=blue>Miraculous</FONT></B> is, of course, used in a religious context to refer to supernatural acts of saints or deities: the <I><FONT color=brown>miraculous</FONT></I> ability to levitate attributed to some Tibetan lamas; the <I><FONT color=brown>miraculous</FONT></I> changing of water into wine during the marriage at Cana. On a less elevated plane, <I><FONT color=brown>miraculous</FONT></I> is often used to refer to a last-minute or unexpected stroke of good fortune: a <I><FONT color=brown>miraculous</FONT></I> escape from their pursuers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Preternatural</FONT></B> puts contention to rest by specifically indicating those things that seem beyond explanation in terms of ordinary reality, but that are the result of unusual or rare causes: a <I><FONT color=brown>preternatural</FONT></I> ability to do complicated sums in his head. [Science works with <I><FONT color=brown>preternatural</FONT></I> phenomena in hopes of including them eventually within the widening circle of what we consider natural and explainable.] <B><FONT color=blue>Superhuman</FONT></B> indicates powers beyond those possessed by man, but again overtones obtrude; one might speak of the <I><FONT color=brown>superhuman</FONT></I> force of a hurricane or the <I><FONT color=brown>superhuman</FONT></I> compassion of God, but such descriptions might seem obvious, therefore trivial or irreverent. More often the word is used as a simple hyperbole for human effort that seems extreme: his room-mate’s <I><FONT color=brown>superhuman</FONT></I> powers of concentration.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bizarre">BIZARRE</A>, <A href="entry://Mystical">MYSTICAL</A>, <A href="entry://Queer">QUEER</A>, <A href="entry://Unusual">UNUSUAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: earthly, <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Standard">STANDARD</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>, <A href="entry://Worldly">WORLDLY</A>.</P>

<P>These words suggest a smooth working of parts, especially in reference to a well-conditioned physique. <B><FONT color=blue>Supple</FONT></B> suggests a body capable of effortless movement: Unlike swimming, weight-lifting does not result in a <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I> build. Used of physical objects, <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I> suggests that something can be bent without breaking or without becoming permanently distorted: <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I> branches trembling in the faint breeze. Used more abstractly, <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I> suggests something that is relaxed rather than taut, or something that is smoothly articulated: the rhythmically insistent yet always <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I> music; a keen <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I> mind able to make fine distinctions.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lithe</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>limber</FONT></B>, of the remaining words, are closet in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Lithe</FONT></I>, in fact, is often used in tandem with <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>lithe</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I> dancers. <I><FONT color=brown>Lithe</FONT></I> tends to suggest gracefulness and trimness of figure. <I><FONT color=brown>Limber</FONT></I> more specifically suggests a body brought into condition through training: Even naturally lithe and <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I> bodies need disciplined exercise to stay <I><FONT color=brown>limber</FONT></I>. While both lithe and <I><FONT color=brown>limber</FONT></I> are less often used of inanimate objects that can be bent, lithe is sometimes used, like <I><FONT color=brown>supple</FONT></I>, to describe character. Its special emphasis here is on an economic spareness: a <I><FONT color=brown>lithe</FONT></I>, understated style of writing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Agile</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>resilient</FONT></B> both stress quickness of response in addition to a smooth working of parts. <I><FONT color=brown>Resilient</FONT></I> specifically emphasizes a rapid rebounding into shape, agile an ability to move quickly yet gracefully: the <I><FONT color=brown>resilient</FONT></I> layer of pine needles under our feet; the <I><FONT color=brown>agile</FONT></I> leap of the doe. Both can refer also to qualities of mind. Here <I><FONT color=brown>agile</FONT></I> stresses the ability to think quickly without faltering: an <I><FONT color=brown>agile</FONT></I> facility for finding the significant pattern in a mass of data. <I><FONT color=brown>Resilient</FONT></I> suggests an innovating mind that is not bound by deadening routine or habit: a <I><FONT color=brown>resilient</FONT></I> hopefulness in the face of seemingly insoluble dilemmas.</P><P>Like <I><FONT color=brown>agile</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>nimble</FONT></B> points to quickness, but here the gracefulness of movement is less emphasized than lightness and dexterity: the <I><FONT color=brown>nimble</FONT></I> fingers of a pianist. <B><FONT color=blue>Spry</FONT></B> stresses unexpected quickness and is often used to describe an old person who is still <I><FONT color=brown>agile</FONT></I> in movement: a <I><FONT color=brown>spry</FONT></I> old man who is still able to play tennis.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adaptable">ADAPTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Malleable">MALLEABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Quick">QUICK</A>, <A href="entry://Thin">THIN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clumsy">CLUMSY</A>, <A href="entry://Heavy">HEAVY</A>, <A href="entry://Slow">SLOW</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Supporter</FONT></B> is the general term for one who allies himself with a cause or show allegiance to its leader. [Henry (later Sir Henry) Parkes was one of the early <I><FONT color=brown>supporters</FONT></I> of the movement for federation of the Australian states, and subsequently became its leader; A political candidate needs the help of his <I><FONT color=brown>supporters</FONT></I> to win an election.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Follower</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>disciple</FONT></B> are related in that they emphasize devotion to a leader rather than to his doctrine or cause. A <I><FONT color=brown>follower</FONT></I> plays a more passive role than a <I><FONT color=brown>supporter</FONT></I> or a <I><FONT color=brown>disciple</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>disciple</FONT></I> is one who studies under a leader or teacher of great influence and puts the leader’s teachings into practice, perhaps to the point of proselytizing for him: Christ had thousands of <I><FONT color=brown>followers</FONT></I>, but it was his <I><FONT color=brown>disciples</FONT></I> who spread his doctrines.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Adherent</FONT></B> places emphasis on support of the doctrines rather than of the leader himself.

<B><FONT color=blue>suppose</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>assume</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>conjecture</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>guess</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>imagine</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>postulate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>surmise</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to the tentative adoption of an idea or interpretation in the face of incomplete evidence or uncertainty. <B><FONT color=blue>Suppose</FONT></B> is the most informal and general of these. It can be used, especially in speech, to present a proposal or opinion in a tentative way, making it come as a suggestion rather than as a directive. [We’d better get going, I <I><FONT color=brown>suppose</FONT></I>.] The word can indicate also any hazarding of opinion, however well- or ill- informed. <B><FONT color=blue>Guess</FONT></B> is more likely to suggest a completely arbitrary notion or a lack of information or authority. <I><FONT color=brown>Guess</FONT></I> can even suggest a bluff or a groping in the dark without any certain hope of success: quiz programmes in which the contestants <I><FONT color=brown>guess</FONT></I> at the answers. Suppose, by contrast, more often suggests a shrewd notion based on some evidence: able to <I><FONT color=brown>suppose</FONT></I> how upset you were just from the expression in your eyes. Also, the word can point to something adopted experimentally or to something entertained simply for the sake of argument: asking him to <I><FONT color=brown>suppose</FONT></I> what he would do if he were in such a situation. Although <I><FONT color=brown>suppose</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>guess</FONT></I>, implies a lack of certainty, there must be some grounds for <I><FONT color=brown>supposing</FONT></I> something, however, scanty. [You're only <I><FONT color=brown>supposing</FONT></I> this on hearsay; you have no proof.]</P><P>Imagine exists in a wider context, indicating either a creative act or a deliberate entertaining of something totally contrary to known fact. In the present context, the word relates more closely to guess, suggesting a paucity of evidence on which a supposition is based: imagining all the wild stories of the neighbours to be true. Imagine emphasizes the role of invention or fancy in influencing perception: He imagined that he had heard a scraping noise. Even so, imagine carries over from its other contexts vague connotations of sympathy, understanding or reassurance, as in its common use as a stock phrase in speech. [You'll enjoy the film, I imagine.] When related to the context of argument or reasoning that surrounds suppose, imagine indicates a more thoroughgoing fabrication: largely imagining the existence of such a lost civilization, rather than demonstrating its existence.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Assume</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>postulate</FONT></B> relate most closely to suppose in suggesting a context of argument or reasoning. <I><FONT color=brown>Assume</FONT></I> is the less formal of the two, emphasizing a conclusion based on little or no valid evidence; as such, it can suggest a general context pertaining to psychological rather than to logical mental operations: <I><FONT color=brown>assuming</FONT></I> that life owed him a living; She <I><FONT color=brown>assumed</FONT></I> he wouldn’t want to know her after their quarrel. In argument, the word is even more clear than <I><FONT color=brown>suppose</FONT></I> about agreeing to adopt a tentative stance in order to test a proposition: <I><FONT color=brown>assuming</FONT></I> the report to be valid simply to see how that would affect our policies in the next decade. In the stricter context of logic and reasoning, both <I><FONT color=brown>postulate</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>assume</FONT></I> point to those things that must be accepted as given prior to the reasoning process: preferring that explanation which requires us to <I><FONT color=brown>postulate</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>assume</FONT></I>) the fewest preconditions at the outset. <I><FONT color=brown>Postulate</FONT></I> is exclusively restricted in reference to the setting up of a theory in order to test its merit; it is therefore more precise than either <I><FONT color=brown>assume</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>suppose</FONT></I>: scientists who are traditionally driven to <I><FONT color=brown>postulate</FONT></I> a series of explanations until they find one that will hold.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Conjecture</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>surmise</FONT></B> are comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>postulate</FONT></I> in formality, but comparable to <I><FONT color=brown>suppose</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>guess</FONT></I> in generality. <I><FONT color=brown>Conjecture</FONT></I> relates closely to <I><FONT color=brown>guess</FONT></I>, stressing the incomplete or inadequate evidence serving as a basis for judgement. A shrewd <I><FONT color=brown>conjecture</FONT></I> may include elements of intuition, extrapolations based on experience, a good sense of probability, and plain luck. When used without qualification, <I><FONT color=brown>conjecture</FONT></I> often indicates mere guesswork unsubstantiated by any evidence and without much credibility: aimless <I><FONT color=brown>conjectures</FONT></I> about conspiracies to overthrow the government, <I><FONT color=brown>conjecturing</FONT></I> how long the enemy would take to zero in on his position. <I><FONT color=brown>Surmise</FONT></I> relates to the aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>suppose</FONT></I> that indicates a shrewd notion based on evidence. The word points to an ability to detect clues and to infer valid conclusions from them; its connotations suggest detachment and an ability to reason dispassionately: <I><FONT color=brown>surmising</FONT></I> from their looks that he had called on them at an inopportune time. <I><FONT color=brown>Surmise</FONT></I> conveys a greater degree of certainty, or at least better grounds for drawing a conclusion, than any of the other words here considered.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Consider">CONSIDER</A>, <A href="entry://Decide">DECIDE</A>, <A href="entry://Reasoning">REASONING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: actualize, execute, finalize, know, prove, validate.</P>

<P>These words all mean free from doubt or uncertainty. <B><FONT color=blue>Sure</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>certain</FONT></B> are used interchangeably in most contexts, but certain may emphasize the indisputable character of what is referred to. <I><FONT color=brown>Sure</FONT></I> is more indiscriminately used. [One thing was <I><FONT color=brown>certain</FONT></I>: he would never again buy a house without checking on the possibility of the land’s being affected by future zoning plans; She was <I><FONT color=brown>sure</FONT></I> that she could make the five o’clock train.] Both words, but especially <I><FONT color=brown>sure</FONT></I>, may serve as polite substitutes for a hopeful but less-than-<I><FONT color=brown>certain</FONT></I> attitude. "I’m <I><FONT color=brown>sure</FONT></I> he'll be here on time" can mean "I think (or I hope) he'll be here on time."</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Positive</FONT></B> is somewhat more emphatic than sure or certain in stressing the absolute absence of doubt and the incontestable nature of one’s conviction. [I was <I><FONT color=brown>positive</FONT></I> that I had seen her face before; I could not possibly have been mistaken on that point.] <B><FONT color=blue>Definite</FONT></B>, influence by its basic meaning of precisely defined or limited (as in "<I><FONT color=brown>definite</FONT></I> boundaries"), is usually used in contexts that suggest a narrowing of choice or elimination of doubt, and often carries the meaning of being no longer open to question, settled beyond doubt. [The people’s choice of a leader was now <I><FONT color=brown>definite</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Doubtless</FONT></B> is more often used as an adverb than as an adjective. Indeed, its use as an adjective today strikes most ears as rather formal or dated. [It was his <I><FONT color=brown>doubtless</FONT></I> conclusion that the verdict was justified by the evidence.] As an adverb, <I><FONT color=brown>doubtless</FONT></I> often functions as a polite substitute for "one supposes," or "one would like to believe," or it appears in contexts that show equivocation or scepticism. [<I><FONT color=brown>Doubtless</FONT></I> he had not meant to offend me, but the tone of his remarks was certainly insulting; It was <I><FONT color=brown>doubtless</FONT></I> true that the agreement was technically legal, but one wondered how ethical it was.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Clear">CLEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Specific">SPECIFIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Doubtful">DOUBTFUL</A>, improbable, unlikely, unsure, wavering.</P>

<P>These words mean to diminish, satisfy completely or take away an appetite for something, often because of over-exposure to it. <B><FONT color=blue>Surfeit</FONT></B> suggests an excess of something that may be appealing in itself but that causes antipathy in quantity: eating second and third helpings of the plum pudding until he was <I><FONT color=brown>surfeited</FONT></I>; a public <I><FONT color=brown>surfeited</FONT></I> to the point of boredom by the violence displayed on the television screen. <B><FONT color=blue>Glut</FONT></B> restricts itself to one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>surfeit</FONT></I>, concentrating on the notion of over-supply without necessarily suggesting any concomitant antipathy: a society <I><FONT color=brown>glutted</FONT></I> yet more and more avid for provocative entertainment. <B><FONT color=blue>Sate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>satiate</FONT></B> once suggested the simple appeasement of hunger or appetite, but now they suggest over-indulgence to the point of discomfort. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>satiate</FONT></I> is the milder and more abstract, and is still sometimes used for simple appeasement: gulping water from the offered flask until his thirst was <I><FONT color=brown>satiated</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Sate</FONT></I> almost invariably suggests the discomfort of over-indulgence, especially in specifically sensual pleasure; the resulting discomfort may be felt as an enfeeblement of the senses or a sybaritic exhaustion or ennui: collapsing into sleep at last, <I><FONT color=brown>sated</FONT></I> with drink and carousing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dull</FONT></B> specifically emphasizes an overtone of sate pertaining to sensory enfeeblement through over-exposure: senses <I><FONT color=brown>dulled</FONT></I> from three days of partying; <I><FONT color=brown>dulling</FONT></I> her appetite by wolfing down half a dozen chocolates. <B><FONT color=blue>Pall</FONT></B> suggests that an attractive or desired object has lost its appeal through over-exposure: a face whose insipid prettiness <I><FONT color=brown>palled</FONT></I> on him the more he looked at it; an interest in theories of conspiracy that <I><FONT color=brown>palled</FONT></I> soon after the detailed report was isused. <B><FONT color=blue>Cloy</FONT></B> suggests a sense of heavy oppression or suffocation caused by excessive gratification of an initially pleasing sensation, especially a sweet smell or fulsome manner: a strong scent of lilacs in the room that soon became <I><FONT color=brown>cloying</FONT></I>; a maternal love so strong that he found it <I><FONT color=brown>cloying</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eat">EAT</A>, <A href="entry://Gourmet">GOURMET</A>, <A href="entry://Satisfy">SATISFY</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean filled with wonder or incredulity because of a confrontation with something unexpected. To be <B><FONT color=blue>surprised</FONT></B> is to meet with something that momentarily, at least, sets one back and then may or may not afford pleasure: <I><FONT color=brown>surprised</FONT></I> to receive a letter from a friend she had not heard from in years; <I><FONT color=brown>surprised</FONT></I> at the drunken behaviour of a business associate whom he had always looked up to. The word can suggest also a certain amount of moral condemnation, as when a person says "I’m <I><FONT color=brown>surprised</FONT></I> at you!"</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Astonished</FONT></B> is a stronger word, indicating that a person has had more than an ordinary reaction to the unexpected: <I><FONT color=brown>astonished</FONT></I> to see how his home town had changed in the past 25 years.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Amazed</FONT></B> suggests great wonder or bewilderment in the face of something that seems impossible or highly improbable: a teacher <I><FONT color=brown>amazed</FONT></I> to find that a lazy student had gained a mark of 100 in an important test. <B><FONT color=blue>Astounded</FONT></B> and the informal <B><FONT color=blue>flabbergasted</FONT></B> express extreme difficulty of belief. A woman may be <I><FONT color=brown>astounded</FONT></I> to learn that her dearest friend has been spreading malicious gossip about her.

<P>These adjectives indicate a dark or brownish colouring of the skin. Both <B><FONT color=blue>swarthy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dusky</FONT></B> signify skin of a dark cast, but the two words differ radically in connotation. <I><FONT color=brown>Swarthy</FONT></I> may be used neutrally in description: a tall man with a <I><FONT color=brown>swarthy</FONT></I> complexion. But it has so often been used to describe fictional characters of a romantic and sometimes sinister aspect that these associations accompany the word more often than not; a <I><FONT color=brown>swarthy</FONT></I> Spaniard or Italian in a Gothic novel. <I><FONT color=brown>Dusky</FONT></I> has exotic rather than suspicious connotations, a quality of mystery rather than menace. It seems somewhat lyrical or literary when applied to skin, suggesting a darkness of colouring that seems to have been dusted on like powder, a shadowy quality like an aura or an overlay: a <I><FONT color=brown>dusky</FONT></I> Moor; the <I><FONT color=brown>dusky</FONT></I> skins of the island girls.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tawny</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tanned</FONT></B> suggest a warm colouring that falls between the extremes of dark and fair. <I><FONT color=brown>Tanned</FONT></I> describes skin that has darkened through exposure to the sun: <I><FONT color=brown>tanned</FONT></I> and healthy after a summer at the beach. <I><FONT color=brown>Tawny</FONT></I> indicates a natural colouring that is yellowish, orangish or reddish brown. This word was once applied to persons having <I><FONT color=brown>tawny</FONT></I>-coloured skin, an American Indian being called a <I><FONT color=brown>tawny</FONT></I>. But now <I><FONT color=brown>tawny</FONT></I> is seldom used of human beings except to describe the colour of hair: a <I><FONT color=brown>tawny</FONT></I>-haired teenager.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Black</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>coloured</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mulatto</FONT></B> are racial designations, implying classification on the basis of skin colour. <I><FONT color=brown>Black</FONT></I> suggests the dark pigmentation of the African Negro, and it is often used to mean Negro in the way that white is used to mean Caucasian: the so-called <I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I> race. <I><FONT color=brown>Black</FONT></I> is often used as a noun meaning the dark-skinned indigenous people of a country: Captain Cook found the <I><FONT color=brown>blacks</FONT></I> hostile when he landed at Botany Bay. The word is decreasing in Australian usage, since it underlines so clearly a colour difference; Aborigine, or Aboriginal, is the term preferred by both whites and non-whites. (The Australian Aborigines are usually classified anthropologically as Australoid or Proto-Caucasoid, not as Negroid.)</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Coloured</FONT></I> means non-white and may designate members of any race other than the Caucasian: <I><FONT color=brown>coloured</FONT></I> people. In practice, <I><FONT color=brown>coloured</FONT></I> is usually reserved for persons who are wholly or partially Negro, but the term may embrace Indians and Orientals as well, or be applied to dark-skinned South Americans or brown-skinned island peoples. <I><FONT color=brown>Coloured</FONT></I> is used in South Africa in a special sense to refer to any person who has both white and non-white ancestors.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Mulatto</FONT></I> indicates the yellowish-brown complexion associated with a person who has one white and one Negro parent. This term is an unpleasant carry-over from an earlier era. It puts offensive stress on the idea of miscegenation, for <I><FONT color=brown>mulatto</FONT></I> derives from a Spanish word meaning "of mixed breed" that goes back to the Latin word for mule.</P><P>Many books could be written about the associations attending the word <I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I> in English and its cognates in European literature, and the corollary associations with the colour <I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I> in folk myths and popular proverbs, idioms and similar expressions. In the literature of Western civilization, the long association of <I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I> with evil (<I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I> arts, <I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I>-hearted), disease (the <I><FONT color=brown>Black</FONT></I> Death), gloom and despair (a <I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I> future) in opposition to the associations of white with goodness, purity, chastity and cleanliness is a fact, however misleading. With the fast-changing relationship between Negroes and whites, the connotations attending <I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I> are likewise changing. Among American Negroes, <I><FONT color=brown>black</FONT></I> is often preferred to Negro as a description of their race, Negro being considered by some as a term used mainly by white people and having disparaging or insulting overtones. This view is not shared by most white people who use it. <I><FONT color=brown>Coloured</FONT></I> is still widely used in the United States to designate Negroes, but is felt by some white people to be indelicate or disparaging. Some Negroes do not seem to find <I><FONT color=brown>coloured</FONT></I> so objectionable, since it is generally used as a simple description.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: fair, light, light-skinned, <A href="entry://Pale">PALE</A>, white, whitish.</P>

<P>These words agree in meaning to become or cause to become larger. <B><FONT color=blue>Swell</FONT></B> is the most general of these terms, and means to increase in bulk or dimension in any way, as by adding air or by absorbing moisture: a mosquito bite that <I><FONT color=brown>swelled</FONT></I> to the size of a pea; a creek <I><FONT color=brown>swollen</FONT></I> into a river. <B><FONT color=blue>Inflate</FONT></B>, on the other hand, means specifically to expand by filling with gas or air: to <I><FONT color=brown>inflate</FONT></I> a balloon or a tyre. Both <I><FONT color=brown>swell</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>inflate</FONT></I> are commonly used in extended senses; <I><FONT color=brown>swell</FONT></I> can apply to any large increase ?<I><FONT color=brown>inflate</FONT></I> always, and <I><FONT color=brown>swell</FONT></I> sometimes, applying to disproportionately large or exaggerated increases: a small business that <I><FONT color=brown>swelled</FONT></I> into a big company almost overnight; to <I><FONT color=brown>swell</FONT></I> the funds of the charitable organization to a record amount; an <I><FONT color=brown>inflated</FONT></I> sense of his own importance. <I><FONT color=brown>Swell</FONT></I> has in many contexts a suggestion of morbidity or unnatural size, illustrated by its metaphorical use in the popular expression "a <I><FONT color=brown>swelled</FONT></I> head," meaning an inflated self-esteem.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bulge</FONT></B> implies swelling outwards, usually in one particular direction.

<P>These words refer to a tangible or visible indication of a detectable or agreed-upon meaning. <B><FONT color=blue>Symbol</FONT></B> is the most complex of these words in its references, emphasizing in all its uses something deliberately made to embody, or constructed to communicate, a certain meaning. A <I><FONT color=brown>symbol</FONT></I> may be arbitrarily arrived at: the <I><FONT color=brown>symbols</FONT></I> of the alphabet; white, the <I><FONT color=brown>symbol</FONT></I> of purity. Or it may be developed by charged circumstances: early Australian landholders who saw in Macarthur the <I><FONT color=brown>symbol</FONT></I> of their cause. In an aesthetic sense, the word may refer to an element carefully chosen and deployed to have a desired effect: a series of unrelated misfortunes in the novel that became <I><FONT color=brown>symbols</FONT></I> for the protagonist’s state of mind.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sign</FONT></B> is often used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>symbol</FONT></I> to refer to a simple, arbitrary representation of an agreed-upon meaning: the <I><FONT color=brown>sign</FONT></I> of the Cross, waving the white flag as a <I><FONT color=brown>sign</FONT></I> that they wished to surrender. Even on the simplest level, the two words are often used in tandem to indicate different things; for example, letters and the words they make are referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>symbols</FONT></I>, punctuation marks as signs. The former yield meanings, the latter phrasings or intonations. On other levels, as well, <I><FONT color=brown>sign</FONT></I> refers to an arbitrary indication from which simple, agreed-upon meanings or instructions can be deduced. Correspondingly, <I><FONT color=brown>symbol</FONT></I> refers to an indication that embodies a greater range of meanings. These must be induced from the exact deployment of the <I><FONT color=brown>symbols</FONT></I> and cannot always be paraphrased without loss. The higher animals as well as man use <I><FONT color=brown>signs</FONT></I>, but only man creates <I><FONT color=brown>symbols</FONT></I>: the typical shriek that monkeys make as a <I><FONT color=brown>sign</FONT></I> to warn others in the tribe of an unexpected danger. [Documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights endure as <I><FONT color=brown>symbols</FONT></I> for human aspirations that are not necessarily enumerated in them.] More loosely, <I><FONT color=brown>sign</FONT></I> is widely used for any sort of tell-tale fact from which information can be deduced: looking for <I><FONT color=brown>signs</FONT></I> that the disease had run its course; a <I><FONT color=brown>sign</FONT></I> that more inflation was on the way.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Emblem</FONT></B> suggests a visual <I><FONT color=brown>symbol</FONT></I> that stands as the distinctive device of a group or nation: the lion that is an <I><FONT color=brown>emblem</FONT></I> of Britain; the hammer-and-sickle <I><FONT color=brown>emblem</FONT></I> of the Soviet Union. <B><FONT color=blue>Badge</FONT></B>, most strictly, is an emblem that designates membership or rank in a military or paramilitary unit or an honour given by it: the <I><FONT color=brown>badge</FONT></I> of the Ninth Division; a Good Conduct <I><FONT color=brown>badge</FONT></I>; a merit <I><FONT color=brown>badge</FONT></I>; the fleur-de-lis <I><FONT color=brown>badge</FONT></I> of the Boy Scouts; turning back his lapel to show his blood-bank <I><FONT color=brown>badge</FONT></I>. Sometimes the word can be used as a more colourful substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>emblem</FONT></I>: wearing the scarlet letter as the <I><FONT color=brown>badge</FONT></I> of her disgrace. <B><FONT color=blue>Hallmark</FONT></B> was originally a distinguishing mark stamped on sterling silver; now the word may refer to an <I><FONT color=brown>emblem</FONT></I> chosen to represent a group or business: the drawing of a comet that appeared as a <I><FONT color=brown>hallmark</FONT></I> on the company’s stationery. Even more generally, it can refer to any unmistakable or outstanding feature by which something can be recognized: the wit and dignity that was the <I><FONT color=brown>hallmark</FONT></I> of his administration; integrity, the <I><FONT color=brown>hallmark</FONT></I> of a gentleman.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Device</FONT></B>, in this sense, refers to a symbolic figure or design, usually with a motto or legend, in a coat of arms borne upon a shield. It may denote also any emblem that has been adopted by a person or a family. By extension, the old-fashioned publisher’s colophon or tail-piece, or an easily recognizable <I><FONT color=brown>symbol</FONT></I> used as a trade mark, are sometimes called <I><FONT color=brown>devices</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Token</FONT></B> most often refers to something offered as a <I><FONT color=brown>symbol</FONT></I> or reminder of an attitude or understanding: giving her a kiss as a <I><FONT color=brown>token</FONT></I> of his love: keeping the medals as a <I><FONT color=brown>token</FONT></I> by which to remember her dead son. More recently, the word may suggest a partial effort or a minimal company businesses that employ one ex-convict as a <I><FONT color=brown>token</FONT></I> of their liberality.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: MEAN (V.), <A href="entry://Meaning">MEANING</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to evidence from which a whole situation, such as the presence of a disease, may be inferred. <B><FONT color=blue>Symptom</FONT></B> relates closely to a medical context, applying to any manifestations of unusual functioning that may or may not be relevant to a diagnosis: unexplained <I><FONT color=brown>symptoms</FONT></I> of dizziness and nausea. Similarly, each abnormal condition or disease exhibits characteristic <I><FONT color=brown>symptoms</FONT></I>: required to name the tell-tale <I><FONT color=brown>symptoms</FONT></I> of hundreds of diseases. A <B><FONT color=blue>syndrome</FONT></B> is that set of <I><FONT color=brown>symptoms</FONT></I> that always occur together and are characteristic of a particular disease, whether physical or mental. A <I><FONT color=brown>syndrome</FONT></I> is not the sum total of random <I><FONT color=brown>symptoms</FONT></I> detected in someone at a given check-up, but only those that fit together into the typical picture of a specific disease or ailment: the <I><FONT color=brown>syndrome</FONT></I> for one kind of hepatitis that includes yellowing of the skin, extreme fatigue and certain digestive disorders; delusions, the hearing of voices, and a feeling of being persecuted that are an inevitable part of the paranoid’s <I><FONT color=brown>syndrome</FONT></I>. This word has become a fad word for any set of characteristics commonly fund in association, usually used with a negative tone: recognizing in him the whole Marxist <I><FONT color=brown>syndrome</FONT></I> after the briefest of conversations. <B><FONT color=blue>Prodrome</FONT></B>, a medical term, does not, like <I><FONT color=brown>syndrome</FONT></I>, refer to a collection of <I><FONT color=brown>symptoms</FONT></I> but to any single <I><FONT color=brown>symptom</FONT></I> that is premonitory of an approaching disease: the chronic aneamia that may be a <I><FONT color=brown>prodrome</FONT></I> for leukaemia.</P><P>While <B><FONT color=blue>indication</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>clue</FONT></B> may be used in a medical context, both are also used widely outside it. <I><FONT color=brown>Clue</FONT></I>, in fact, relates more directly to the field of criminology than to medicine. As such, it refers to the evidence by which a crime may be solved or from which a whole situation may be inferred: gathering <I><FONT color=brown>clues</FONT></I> at the scene of the murder that could lead them to the killer. In a wider context, the word can refer to any tell-tale evidence whether given intentionally or inadvertently: asking for some <I><FONT color=brown>clue</FONT></I> as to how she felt about him; noticing several <I><FONT color=brown>clues</FONT></I> that suggested he had interests similar to her own. <I><FONT color=brown>Indication</FONT></I> is the most general of these words and can point to any piece of tell-tale evidence in any situation or context: <I><FONT color=brown>indications</FONT></I> of the drug’s effectiveness; <I><FONT color=brown>indications</FONT></I> that a quarrel had immediately preceded the murder; giving her innumerable <I><FONT color=brown>indications</FONT></I> of a country’s economic health.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hint">HINT</A>, <A href="entry://Mean">MEAN</A>, <A href="entry://Premonition">PREMONITION</A>, <A href="entry://Testimony">TESTIMONY</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>systematic</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>methodical</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>orderly</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>regular</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all imply adherence to a design, an arrangement or a premeditated sequence of activities. <B><FONT color=blue>Systematic</FONT></B> implies an overriding concept or method of organization, and suggests a thoroughgoing principle that determines the operation, control or conduct of some process: a <I><FONT color=brown>systematic</FONT></I> analysis of the effects of government spending on the gross national product; a <I><FONT color=brown>systematic</FONT></I> exposition of the relationship between slum conditions and drug addiction. <B><FONT color=blue>Methodical</FONT></B>, on the other hand, need not suggest a guiding principle or a complex organization, but only a planned, often step-by-step, arrangement or process. <I><FONT color=brown>Methodical</FONT></I> often implies routine and painstaking effort as part of a fateful or ineluctable evolution towards some end: the <I><FONT color=brown>methodical</FONT></I> process of weeding out snipers by a building-by-building search of the conquered city. In some contexts the word suggests extreme detachment to the point of ruthlessness: The murderer <I><FONT color=brown>methodically</FONT></I> bound and gagged each victim before killing them.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Orderly</FONT></B> has a suggestion of neatness or care, and indicates an arrangement or design that is kept within predetermined limits; the emphasis is on the manner of achievement rather than on the end sought, as is most often the case with <I><FONT color=brown>methodical</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> development from a predominantly rural, agricultural economy to a modern industrial economy. <I><FONT color=brown>Orderly</FONT></I> thus implies the absence of violence or disruption. <B><FONT color=blue>Regular</FONT></B> means according to a fixed rule or standard, and suggests the lack of innovation, accident or uncertainty; it emphasizes the steadiness or continuing nature of something done according to plan: a <I><FONT color=brown>regular</FONT></I> programme by which underprivileged children can be given extra remedial instruction. Perhaps these words can best be distinguished by contrasting them with their opposites, as here considered. <I><FONT color=brown>Systematic</FONT></I> is opposed to random, <I><FONT color=brown>methodical</FONT></I> to haphazard, <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> to chaotic, and <I><FONT color=brown>regular</FONT></I> to eccentric.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Formal">FORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Method">METHOD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: chaotic, disarranged, disorderly, disorganized, messy, <A href="entry://Random">RANDOM</A>, <A href="entry://Unruly">UNRULY</A>.</P>

<P>These words are alike in meaning restrained in speaking to others or reserved in manner. <B><FONT color=blue>Taciturn</FONT></B> characterizes a disposition to speak little, and then grudgingly; it conveys the strong suggestion of a dryness of manner bordering on unsociability. ["Yes," was his <I><FONT color=brown>taciturn</FONT></I> response to the complex question posed; His was such a cold, <I><FONT color=brown>taciturn</FONT></I> nature that he could not even be relied upon to return a civil greeting.] <B><FONT color=blue>Reticent</FONT></B> implies a reluctance to speak freely about particular matters, especially about the one’s private affairs, rather than a quality of temperament, as is the case with <I><FONT color=brown>taciturn</FONT></I>. [He became <I><FONT color=brown>reticent</FONT></I> when asked to divulge his income; <I><FONT color=brown>reticent</FONT></I> about discussing his life before his marriage.] <B><FONT color=blue>Close</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>taciturn</FONT></I>, indicates a habit of temperament rather than particular instance. One who is close says little of his own affairs, perhaps because he has something to hide. <B><FONT color=blue>Secretive</FONT></B> makes the explicit accusation of knowing concealment, and is broader than the other words here considered in not necessarily applying to what is unsaid; it may apply instead to the manner of what is said: something <I><FONT color=brown>secretive</FONT></I> about him, although he answers you questions readily enough. <I><FONT color=brown>Secretive</FONT></I> implies suspicion or mistrust on the part of the observer: Why is she so <I><FONT color=brown>secretive</FONT></I> about her friends?</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Uncommunicative</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>taciturn</FONT></I>, implies an unwillingness to speak even when speech is called for, but more strongly points to unsociable behaviour as the underlying motive for such reluctance: police occupied with interrogating an <I><FONT color=brown>uncommunicative</FONT></I> suspect; disturbed children who were sullen and <I><FONT color=brown>uncommunicative</FONT></I>.

<P>These words denote something that is regarded as having magical powers. A <B><FONT color=blue>talisman</FONT></B> is a material object that is supposed to work wonders because it possesses and transmits certain qualities. It is believed to have a positive power in itself. A <I><FONT color=brown>talisman</FONT></I> may be carried on the person, or, like Aladdin’s lamp, simply be put to use as desired or needed. Aaron’s rod in the Old Testament is a <I><FONT color=brown>talisman</FONT></I>, as are the magician’s wand and the cap of invisibility in folklore. In a figurative sense, a <I><FONT color=brown>talisman</FONT></I> is something that produces, or is capable of producing, extraordinary effects: The young queen’s dignity and beauty were <I><FONT color=brown>talismans</FONT></I> against unfavourable public opinion.</P><P>In common use, <I><FONT color=brown>talisman</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>amulet</FONT></B> are frequently confused. An <I><FONT color=brown>amulet</FONT></I> is a piece of stone, metal, bone or wood inscribed with a magic incantation. It is almost always worn on the person and is supposed to protect the wearer from danger, disease and witchcraft, or to ensure him of success, as in love or war. Unlike the <I><FONT color=brown>talisman</FONT></I>, the <I><FONT color=brown>amulet</FONT></I> is supposed to confer passive and preventive protection and not produce active magic.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Charm</FONT></B> is the most general word and includes anything that has occult powers. <I><FONT color=brown>Talismans</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>amulets</FONT></I> may both be referred to as <B><FONT color=blue><I><FONT color=brown>charms</FONT></B></FONT></I>. In modern times the small metal miniatures worn on chains or bracelets, and called <I><FONT color=brown>charms</FONT></I>, are no doubt a carry-over from the old or primitive custom of wearing <I><FONT color=brown>amulets</FONT></I>. But, in the strictest sense, a charm is the uttering of words or rhymes supposed to produce magical results. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>charm</FONT></I> is the power to allure or delight: the <I><FONT color=brown>charm</FONT></I> of a beautiful child; the <I><FONT color=brown>charm</FONT></I> of Mozart’s music.</P><P>In animistic religions, a <B><FONT color=blue>fetish</FONT></B> is an object worshipped by primitive peoples because they believe it to be the dwelling of a friendly spirit. Among such objects used as <I><FONT color=brown>fetishes</FONT></I> are stones, teeth, carved bits of wood, and plants. Figuratively, a <I><FONT color=brown>fetish</FONT></I> is something to which one is excessively devoted: housewives who make a <I><FONT color=brown>fetish</FONT></I> of cleanliness. Psychiatrically, it can refer to any object or part of the body on which a deviant’s eroticism is fixated: confessed to a <I><FONT color=brown>fetish</FONT></I> for women’s underclothing; a foot <I><FONT color=brown>fetish</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Supernatural">SUPERNATURAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the tendency or ability to talk smoothly, readily, tediously, continually or at length. <B><FONT color=blue>Talkative</FONT></B> is relatively informal and, most often, neutral in tone. It describes a person who is easily engaged in conversation or is given to expressing himself verbally with little prompting. Context can make the word negative: a <I><FONT color=brown>talkative</FONT></I> bore. More commonly, it is descriptively neutral or even approving. When the latter is true, the word may suggest an outgoing sociable person: good to be among people who were friendly and <I><FONT color=brown>talkative</FONT></I> after facing the hostile silence of the villagers all day. <B><FONT color=blue>Gabby</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>magging</FONT></B> are the least formal of these words. When used in reference to compulsive talkers, they are firmly negative in tone: a lot of <I><FONT color=brown>gabby</FONT></I> women exchanging the latest gossip; <I><FONT color=brown>magging</FONT></I> housewives who never leave the telephone. Sometimes they can be used without harsh intent, when meant humorously or in self-deprecation: missing the <I><FONT color=brown>gabby</FONT></I> sessions he’d enjoyed at boarding-school; apologizing for having been so <I><FONT color=brown>gabby</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Magging</FONT></I> also can be good-humoured, but in this and its other sense it is most frequently used in the noun form: nothing like a good <I><FONT color=brown>mag</FONT></I> over a cup of tea. <B><FONT color=blue>Chatty</FONT></B>, also informal, is not so negative in tone as <I><FONT color=brown>gabby</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>magging</FONT></I>. It implies the good-natured imparting of relatively unimportant news and is particularly feminine in its associations: a <I><FONT color=brown>chatty</FONT></I> women’s magazine; a <I><FONT color=brown>chatty</FONT></I> afternoon-tea party.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Voluble</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>glib</FONT></B> pertain specifically to the ease with which someone is able to converse or speak. Of moderate formality, <I><FONT color=brown>voluble</FONT></I> once pointed to a pleasing facility in speech, gesture, manners and writing; now it pertains more strictly to free-and-easy verbal smoothness. It may be approving in tone or indulgently critical: a beautifully modulated voice that contributed to the impression he made of being a <I><FONT color=brown>voluble</FONT></I> speaker; a <I><FONT color=brown>voluble</FONT></I> neighbour, always eager to tell me the local gossip. <I><FONT color=brown>Glib</FONT></I>, by contrast, is more harshly and consistently negative in tone, referring to a smooth, slick and possibly vulgar way of speaking, as one adopted to mask insincerity, superficiality or dishonesty: the <I><FONT color=brown>glib</FONT></I> flattery doled out at business cocktail parties; a student free with <I><FONT color=brown>glib</FONT></I> answers but lacking thoughtfulness; <I><FONT color=brown>glib</FONT></I> door-to-door salesmen.</P><P>Unlike the previous pair, <B><FONT color=blue>loquacious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>garrulous</FONT></B> are less concerned with verbal smoothness than with talk that is incessant or lengthy. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>loquacious</FONT></I> is less clear-cut in tone. When positive, it serves as an intensification of the favourable implications of <I><FONT color=brown>talkative</FONT></I>, with a suggestion of the fluency implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>voluble</FONT></I>: a earnest and <I><FONT color=brown>loquacious</FONT></I> advocate of open-plan architecture. When negative in tone, it can suggest an overbearing insistence on holding forth without regard for one’s listeners: <I><FONT color=brown>loquacious</FONT></I> public speaker who always exceeded the time allotted for his speech. <I><FONT color=brown>Garrulous</FONT></I> is wholly negative in tone and as such is an intensification of the negative possibilities in <I><FONT color=brown>loquacious</FONT></I>. The word suggests a non-stop talker who is rambling, wordy, possibly foolish and usually tedious. It suggests someone who is unable to be concise or who insists on monopolizing conversations: a <I><FONT color=brown>garrulous</FONT></I> old man who kept interrupting their chat with lengthy accounts of his latest fishing trip.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Chatter">CHATTER</A>, <A href="entry://Patter">PATTER</A>, <A href="entry://Say">SAY</A>, <A href="entry://Verbose">VERBOSE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Silent">SILENT</A>, <A href="entry://Speechless">SPEECHLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Taciturn">TACITURN</A>, <A href="entry://Terse">TERSE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all refer to the pleasant sensations accompanying an agreeable taste or flavour. <B><FONT color=blue>Tasty</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>delicious</FONT></B> are more common in speech and less formal than the other words here considered. <I><FONT color=brown>Tasty</FONT></I> merely refers to a fine flavour; <I><FONT color=brown>delicious</FONT></I> stresses more strongly the great pleasure that attends a fine-tasting food: a <I><FONT color=brown>tasty</FONT></I> hors d抩euvre; a <I><FONT color=brown>delicious</FONT></I> imported pâté that was eaten by the guests almost as quickly as it could be served. <I><FONT color=brown>Delicious</FONT></I> is not necessarily restricted to pleasure induced by taste: a <I><FONT color=brown>delicious</FONT></I> silence in the park away from the noisy traffic. <I><FONT color=brown>Taste</FONT></I> is nevertheless the most common association with <I><FONT color=brown>delicious</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Palatable</FONT></B> implies more modest or equivocal pleasure than any of the other words of this group. <I><FONT color=brown>Palatable</FONT></I> is now most often used to mean acceptably good or agreeable, especially when the thing tasted has not been regarded as very <I><FONT color=brown>tasty</FONT></I>: Missionaries found the native food <I><FONT color=brown>palatable</FONT></I> if not always <I><FONT color=brown>delicious</FONT></I>. In its extended senses, <I><FONT color=brown>palatable</FONT></I> refers to some saving feature that makes an otherwise unattractive thing or condition acceptable: Being dropped from the singles match was made more <I><FONT color=brown>palatable</FONT></I> to the tennis player by the news that he would play in the doubles.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Flavourful</FONT></B> literally means full of flavour, but is more commonly used to mean having a strong and pleasant flavour: a <I><FONT color=brown>flavourful</FONT></I> brew of tea. <B><FONT color=blue>Toothsome</FONT></B> suggests a succulent or voluptuous quality attending a pleasant taste. In figurative uses, in which the word is perhaps more commonly used today, the quality of being appetizing or sensually attractive predominates: a <I><FONT color=brown>toothsome</FONT></I> bevy of bathing beauties.

tax
<B><FONT color=blue>tax</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>assess</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>impose</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>levy</FONT></B>:

<P>These words pertain to a government’s exacting of money or other forms of support from its citizens or those dealing with them. <B><FONT color=blue>Tax</FONT></B> is the most general and least formal of these. It refers almost exclusively to the raising of money, although this may be done through a variety of means: the average citizen who ends up being <I><FONT color=brown>taxed</FONT></I> according to his income, general purchases, real-estate holdings, buying of imported goods ?and even his amusements and luxuries. One of the points of <I><FONT color=brown>tax</FONT></I> is its emphasis on the actual collection of money. This contrasts with <B><FONT color=blue>assess</FONT></B>, which points to a determining of the basis for <I><FONT color=brown>taxing</FONT></I> someone; the reference of the word now is usually to the <I><FONT color=brown>taxing</FONT></I> of real estate: <I><FONT color=brown>assessing</FONT></I> his property at a higher valuation because of improvements he had made on it. In related uses, the word may refer also to determining the amount of a fine: damages <I><FONT color=brown>assessed</FONT></I> by the court at $10,000.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Impose</FONT></B> may suggest the determining of fines, punishment or taxes in individual cases: <I><FONT color=brown>imposing</FONT></I> stiff fines on drunken drivers; <I><FONT color=brown>imposing</FONT></I> a light sentence on a first offender. More closely related to <I><FONT color=brown>tax</FONT></I> is its reference to a governmental decision, general in nature, to tap new sources of revenue or support: <I><FONT color=brown>imposing</FONT></I> additional taxes on business expansion; <I><FONT color=brown>imposing</FONT></I> national service on young men of 20. When its emphasis is on determination rather than collection, it is like assess, except for its indication of a general decision. A legislative body might <I><FONT color=brown>impose</FONT></I> terms concerning the amount and source of new revenue, after which each affected person might be <I><FONT color=brown>assessed</FONT></I> and then <I><FONT color=brown>taxed</FONT></I> accordingly. <I><FONT color=brown>Impose</FONT></I> in these senses has neutral force, but it can easily be given overtones of repressive or arbitrary wilfulness: a staggering burden of taxation <I><FONT color=brown>imposed</FONT></I> on those who can least afford it; a policy of <I><FONT color=brown>imposing</FONT></I> heavy duties on certain imported commodities. <B><FONT color=blue>Levy</FONT></B> may sometimes he used to indicate determination, like assess or <I><FONT color=brown>impose</FONT></I>, but more appropriately, as its root suggests, it refers to the actual raising ?that is, the collection or exaction of the amount <I><FONT color=brown>assessed</FONT></I> or the duty <I><FONT color=brown>imposed</FONT></I>: a stabilizing of prices when the new tax began to be <I><FONT color=brown>levied</FONT></I>; army officers who <I><FONT color=brown>levied</FONT></I> troops and quarters from the defeated people by the most arbitrary means possible.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compel">COMPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Demand">DEMAND</A>, <A href="entry://Obligation">OBLIGATION</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the process by which knowledge is imparted to students. <B><FONT color=blue>Teach</FONT></B> suggests a guided process of assigned work, discipline, directed study and the presentation of examples. It may or may not suggest an academic context: <I><FONT color=brown>teaching</FONT></I> his son to change a flat tyre; <I><FONT color=brown>teaching</FONT></I> her pupils the letters of the alphabet.

Sometimes the word suggests the accomplishing of greater results than <I><FONT color=brown>teach</FONT></I>: schools that <I><FONT color=brown>teach</FONT></I> but fail to <I><FONT color=brown>educate</FONT></I> their students.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>School</FONT></B> is used rarely as a substitute for teach, and suggests an especially thorough process: <I><FONT color=brown>schooling</FONT></I> the class in the essentials of arithmetic; parents who had <I><FONT color=brown>schooled</FONT></I> their children in the social graces. Oddly enough, as in the last example, the word need not suggest an academic context at all, though it does indicate a special effort or training, often to master complex rather than rudimentary matters: <I><FONT color=brown>schooling</FONT></I> himself in the fine distinctions his new job would require him to make; having <I><FONT color=brown>schooled</FONT></I> herself to ignore his angry outbursts. <B><FONT color=blue>Instruct</FONT></B> is closer in function to <I><FONT color=brown>teach</FONT></I> than educate or school. It is more formal, and is mostly restricted to the specific situation of guided training or to the imparting of information or commands: one teacher to give the lecture classes, another to <I><FONT color=brown>instruct</FONT></I> the discussion groups; a manual <I><FONT color=brown>instructing</FONT></I> the buyer on the installation of an air-conditioner; <I><FONT color=brown>instructing</FONT></I> the cleaning woman to come an hour earlier on Monday.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Tutor</FONT></B> refers to an individual relationship between teacher and student: English university colleges where each student is <I><FONT color=brown>tutored</FONT></I> by a don. Often the word refers to remedial or special work done outside the classroom: offering to <I><FONT color=brown>tutor</FONT></I> him in French in exchange for German lessons; The schoolboy’s father engaged a university student to <I><FONT color=brown>tutor</FONT></I> him in his worst subjects. In many universities and other tertiary institutions, the <I><FONT color=brown>tutoring</FONT></I> is carried out with small groups rather than, or as well as, with individuals.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Coach</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>train</FONT></B> are rather specialized kinds of teaching which have been extended from their usual sporting context to the more academic. <I><FONT color=brown>Coach</FONT></I> is very similar to the sense of tutor in which the student is helped individually or in a group, but with the essential difference that <I><FONT color=brown>coach</FONT></I> is not used when advancement of knowledge is involved. It is specifically regarded as a helping or remedial type of <I><FONT color=brown>teaching</FONT></I>: He was privately <I><FONT color=brown>coached</FONT></I> in mathematics to bring him level with the rest of his class. In its educational sense, <I><FONT color=brown>train</FONT></I> is used when certain skills as well as knowledge are being mastered for some higher vocation: <I><FONT color=brown>trained</FONT></I> as an X-ray technician; an extension of in-service <I><FONT color=brown>training</FONT></I> for teachers.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indoctrinate</FONT></B>, alone of these words, suggests the inculcation of propaganda or prejudices rather than unbiased knowledge; parents who <I><FONT color=brown>indoctrinate</FONT></I> their children with religious intolerance; school that unconsciously <I><FONT color=brown>indoctrinate</FONT></I> their students with middle-class values.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Implant">IMPLANT</A>, <A href="entry://Learning">LEARNING</A>, <A href="entry://Student">STUDENT</A>, <A href="entry://Study">STUDY</A>.</P>

tear
<B><FONT color=blue>tear</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rend</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rip</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rive</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are comparable in that they all refer to a pulling apart of a material or an object, or to the separating of two objects that are firmly bound together. <B><FONT color=blue>Tear</FONT></B> is the most general word in the group and has the widest application. It can denote the pulling apart of a seamless piece of material, such as cloth or paper, suggesting in this case that the edges of the resultant pieces are rough or irregular: <I><FONT color=brown>tearing</FONT></I> an old sheet into cleaning rags. It can refer to the damaging action of such a pulling apart: cursing under his breath when a nail <I><FONT color=brown>tore</FONT></I> a hole in his pants. It can be used in application to an injury or laceration: <I><FONT color=brown>tearing</FONT></I> her skin when picking roses. Figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>tear</FONT></I> can mean to disrupt or distress: a political party <I><FONT color=brown>torn</FONT></I> by dissension; a sight to <I><FONT color=brown>tear</FONT></I> one’s heart.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rip</FONT></B> has special application to the division of a fabric by <I><FONT color=brown>tearing</FONT></I> along a line of least resistance or by cutting or breaking a row of stitches: <I><FONT color=brown>ripping</FONT></I> a dress apart along its seams. It can designate also any kind of <I><FONT color=brown>tearing</FONT></I> or cutting that is accomplished with harshness or violence: <I><FONT color=brown>ripping</FONT></I> open an old wound.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rend</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rive</FONT></B> have even stronger overtones of violence than <I><FONT color=brown>rip</FONT></I> in their reference to a <I><FONT color=brown>tearing</FONT></I>, splitting or pulling apart by force: buildings rent by an earthquake; a tree <I><FONT color=brown>riven</FONT></I> by lightning. Figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>rend</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>rive</FONT></I> are like tear in their application to dissension or painful affliction: a nation <I><FONT color=brown>rent</FONT></I> by civil war; a heart <I><FONT color=brown>riven</FONT></I> by despair. Today, <I><FONT color=brown>rend</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>rive</FONT></I> tend to sound lofty and poetical.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cut">CUT</A>, <A href="entry://Sever">SEVER</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Connect">CONNECT</A>, <A href="entry://Repair">REPAIR</A>, <A href="entry://Treat">TREAT</A>.</P>

teem
<B><FONT color=blue>teem</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>abound</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>overflow</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>swarm</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to great amounts or to dense clusters. <B><FONT color=blue>Teem</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>swarm</FONT></B> both refer to the rapid, independent movement of particles in a small space or cluster. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>swarm</FONT></I> is more concrete and more limited in application outside this literal situation: bees <I><FONT color=brown>swarming</FONT></I> around a hive; peak-hour traffic <I><FONT color=brown>swarming</FONT></I> over the bridges into the city; enemy soldiers who came <I><FONT color=brown>swarming</FONT></I> towards us down the hill: a section of the city that <I><FONT color=brown>swarmed</FONT></I> with hippies. <I><FONT color=brown>Teem</FONT></I> is even more emphatic about the frenetic nature of the activity referred to. While the word can have literal application, it is more often applied figuratively. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>swarm</FONT></I>, which can often carry a negative tone, <I><FONT color=brown>teem</FONT></I> frequently suggests approval for anything that seems instinct with vibrant life: Shakespeare’s <I><FONT color=brown>teeming</FONT></I> brain; a novel <I><FONT color=brown>teeming</FONT></I> with memorable characters and incidents; a new generation <I><FONT color=brown>teeming</FONT></I> with exuberance and iconoclasm. When the word applies in a more nearly neutral way, it can still have a tone of panoramic lyricism: the <I><FONT color=brown>teeming</FONT></I> slums of the city.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Overflow</FONT></B> can specifically refer to a fluid that overruns its container: floodwaters that threatened to <I><FONT color=brown>overflow</FONT></I> hastily erected sandbag barriers. In figurative use, the word suggests approval for qualities that someone or something possesses and gives off in copious amounts: a personality <I><FONT color=brown>overflowing</FONT></I> with kindness and generosity. Less often, the word can refer to any-superfluity, as of emotion: pinched, bitter faces <I><FONT color=brown>overflowing</FONT></I> with sullen distrust. <B><FONT color=blue>Abound</FONT></B> is the most general of these words and the most vague in its implications; it suggests a generous portion, usually of favourable qualities: a country that <I><FONT color=brown>abounds</FONT></I> in architectural masterpieces; those of us who still <I><FONT color=brown>abound</FONT></I> in good will. Used negatively, the word can contribute an ironic forcefulness: a government <I><FONT color=brown>abounded</FONT></I> in broken promises.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Flow">FLOW</A>, <A href="entry://Generous">GENEROUS</A>, <A href="entry://Prevalent">PREVALENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: vacate, <A href="entry://Wane">WANE</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in the general sense of communicating with others in speech or writing. <B><FONT color=blue>Tell</FONT></B>, the least formal of the group, is applicable in many contexts where others would be more exact or pertinent, but in the sense of making something known or of disclosing or revealing, it is the word of choice: He would not <I><FONT color=brown>tell</FONT></I> who was to blame.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Narrate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>relate</FONT></B> both imply conscious and deliberate attention to the communication of a story, suggesting an orderly arrangement of the details with a view to continuity, completeness and artistic effect.

<P>These words refer to a person’s mental make-up or emotional state. <B><FONT color=blue>Temperament</FONT></B> applies most commonly to a cast of mind that is revealed by the fixed or habitual ways a person responds to life; the word may suggest either an innate or a learnt pattern, but it does point to something deeply ingrained or unconscious rather than something reflecting an arbitrary or conscious choice. Otherwise, the word can indicate any sort of mental or emotional state: a basically frivolous <I><FONT color=brown>temperament</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>temperament</FONT></I> marked by restless curiosity. The word can also typify a group of people: the no-nonsense <I><FONT color=brown>temperament</FONT></I> of the British. When unqualified, it indicates a tendency towards intense and moody rebelliousness; this is a more informal use of the word: a child full of <I><FONT color=brown>temperament</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disposition</FONT></B> can refer to an enduring frame of mind, whether innate or learnt, but it points more strictly to emotional qualities that are only one part of the more formal temperament: a grouchy <I><FONT color=brown>disposition</FONT></I>; her usually sunny <I><FONT color=brown>disposition</FONT></I>. It contrasts most sharply with temperament in that it can be used for transitory emotional states: coming to work in a foul <I><FONT color=brown>disposition</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Nature</FONT></B>, in contrast to all these words, is the most emphatic about the innate also the widest range of traits, including emotional, mental and physical qualities: by <I><FONT color=brown>nature</FONT></I> a timid little man of mediocre intelligence; those natures that are unhesitatingly magnanimous and compassionate. It is also the only one of these words that is commonly used when generalizing about traits inherent in mankind as a whole: anthropologists who have successfully challenged our culture-bound notions about the <I><FONT color=brown>nature</FONT></I> of man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Character</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>personality</FONT></B> both point to aggregations of mental and emotional traits, innate and learnt, that distinguish one person from another. <I><FONT color=brown>Character</FONT></I> points to the fully developed life-style of an adult or group and often relates to moral fibre: drinking companions of questionable <I><FONT color=brown>character</FONT></I>; the stern but resourceful <I><FONT color=brown>character</FONT></I> of the Pilgrim Fathers. <I><FONT color=brown>Personality</FONT></I> pertains more to the whole indefinable emotional colouration that a specific person gives off: the young girl’s winsome <I><FONT color=brown>personality</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>personality</FONT></I> crippled by arrogance and impatience. Used without qualification, <I><FONT color=brown>character</FONT></I> suggests moral forcefulness, personality emotional appeal: He has <I><FONT color=brown>character</FONT></I> but no personality. In this use, the word can apply to anything thought to exhibit these qualities, especially when they are distinctive in their force or appeal: a face with <I><FONT color=brown>character</FONT></I>; paintings completely lacking in <I><FONT color=brown>character</FONT></I>; a striking city, full of <I><FONT color=brown>personality</FONT></I>.

<P>These words refer to an avoidance of pleasurable excesses. <B><FONT color=blue>Temperance</FONT></B>, correctly used, refers to a wise moderation of indulgence in such pleasures, but as commonly used it suggests a complete rejection, especially of alcohol: a <I><FONT color=brown>temperance</FONT></I> that extended to declining drinks until four in the afternoon; the question of <I><FONT color=brown>temperance</FONT></I> that inflamed women against the evils of that devil, whisky. <B><FONT color=blue>Self-denial</FONT></B> and sobriety are, of themselves, vague as to the extent to which avoidance may or should go. <I><FONT color=brown>Self-denial</FONT></I> is, of course, more general than sobriety but is firmer in tone than <I><FONT color=brown>temperance</FONT></I> in its most general sense, suggesting specifically an attitude of refusing to five in to the demands of one’s own body: a Spartan <I><FONT color=brown>self-denial</FONT></I> that made young men impervious to extremes of heat and cold, to hunger and to the threat of death; a Victorian code of morals that stressed prudish <I><FONT color=brown>self-denial</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Sobriety</FONT></B>, by contrast, usually applies in this context strictly to non-intoxication by alcohol. A person, of course, may be intoxicated one day and in a state of sobriety the next. More broadly, <I><FONT color=brown>sobriety</FONT></I> may suggest a soberness or solemnity of mien: the grim <I><FONT color=brown>sobriety</FONT></I> in the faces of the jury.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abstinence</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>continence</FONT></B> are much clearer than <I><FONT color=brown>self-denial</FONT></I> and sobriety as to the extent of denial involved; they emphasize a total avoidance of sensation. In this they are at odds with the more general implications of <I><FONT color=brown>temperance</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Abstinence</FONT></I>, in context, may refer to an avoidance of alcohol or sexual satisfaction or any specific named: a complete <I><FONT color=brown>abstinence</FONT></I> from salty or spicy foods. <I><FONT color=brown>Continence</FONT></I> usually is taken to mean an avoidance of sexual intercourse in particular, but at its most general it can suggest a range of possibility similar to <I><FONT color=brown>self-denial</FONT></I>: maintaining a certain <I><FONT color=brown>continence</FONT></I> to extra-curricular activities, better to <I><FONT color=brown>concentrate</FONT></I> on his studies.</P><P>A distinctively Australian term, whose origin is obscure but which the late John Norton claimed to have invented, is <B><FONT color=blue>wowserism</FONT></B>, most often found in the noun form, <I><FONT color=brown>wowser</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Wowserism</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>abstinence</FONT></I>, means the complete rejection of strong drink, but, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>abstinence</FONT></I>, carries with it all the most unpleasant connotations of narrowness, rejection of physical pleasures and even objections to other seeking enjoyment in such things as alcohol according to their own consciences: I’ve been a teetotaller all my life but no one can accuse me of <I><FONT color=brown>wowserism</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Abstain">ABSTAIN</A>, <A href="entry://Avoid">AVOID</A>, <A href="entry://Forswear">FORSWEAR</A>, <A href="entry://Reject">REJECT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: avidity, excess, hedonism, indulgence, intemperance.</P>

<P>These words refer to things that last or that remain on the scene for only a brief time. <B><FONT color=blue>Temporary</FONT></B> is the most general term, implying a measurable but limited duration. Unlike most of the other adjectives in this set, it indicates what is meant or known to last for a limited time only: a <I><FONT color=brown>temporary</FONT></I> job, a medicine that gives <I><FONT color=brown>temporary</FONT></I> relief. Further, the word often suggests makeshift arrangements made for the time being under the pressure of circumstances: a <I><FONT color=brown>temporary</FONT></I> shelter form the storm. It is used also to soften the impact of a harsh reality: a <I><FONT color=brown>temporary</FONT></I> set-back, not a final defeat.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Momentary</FONT></B>, used literally, means coming and going away suddenly, in a moment: a <I><FONT color=brown>momentary</FONT></I> misgiving. It is used also to indicate relative brevity of duration: a <I><FONT color=brown>momentary</FONT></I> delay. <B><FONT color=blue>Passing</FONT></B> emphasizes the fact that a thing does not continue to occupy the interest for very long, but runs its course fairly quickly. A <I><FONT color=brown>passing</FONT></I> fad. <B><FONT color=blue>Fleeting</FONT></B> is an intensification of passing in a literal sense, referring to something that <I><FONT color=brown>passes</FONT></I> almost instantaneously: a dilettante too preoccupied with the <I><FONT color=brown>fleeting</FONT></I> moment to settle down to serious work; I caught just a <I><FONT color=brown>fleeting</FONT></I> glimpse of my new neighbour.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Transient</FONT></B> stresses the temporary nature of a stay or the brevity of a thing’s duration. Though in common use as a noun, the word has formal or literary tone when used as an adjective: a <I><FONT color=brown>transient</FONT></I> joy. <B><FONT color=blue>Transitory</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>temporary</FONT></I>, points to impermanence. It designates something destined to pass away, either fairly soon or, at least, eventually: <I><FONT color=brown>transitory</FONT></I> pleasures as opposed to sources of enduring satisfaction; a <I><FONT color=brown>transitory</FONT></I> stage of development.</P><P>In a literal sense, <B><FONT color=blue>ephemeral</FONT></B> refers to that which lasts only a single day. It is stronger than <I><FONT color=brown>transitory</FONT></I> in indicating not only certain but speedy extinction. For this reason, that which is <I><FONT color=brown>ephemeral</FONT></I> is looked upon as slight and perishable. [Man’s life is <I><FONT color=brown>transitory</FONT></I>; a butterfly’s existence is <I><FONT color=brown>ephemeral</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Ephemeral</FONT></I> can sometimes carry a suggestion of contempt as well: the <I><FONT color=brown>ephemeral</FONT></I> popularity of a pretty starlet who never learned how to act. In extension, <I><FONT color=brown>ephemeral</FONT></I> denotes that which changes aspect rapidly or continuously: an <I><FONT color=brown>ephemeral</FONT></I> inspiration. <I><FONT color=brown>Ephemeral</FONT></I> is a rather literary word. <B><FONT color=blue>Evanescent</FONT></B> is lyrical and highly evocative. It refers to that which vanishes almost as soon as it appears, implying that a thing is tenuous, delicate or unsubstantial by its very nature: the <I><FONT color=brown>evanescent</FONT></I> radiance of the sunset; an <I><FONT color=brown>evanescent</FONT></I> glimpse of the truth.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Inconstant">INCONSTANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Everlasting">EVERLASTING</A>, <A href="entry://Immortal">IMMORTAL</A>, <A href="entry://Immutable">IMMUTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Invariable">INVARIABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Permanent">PERMANENT</A>, <A href="entry://Persistent">PERSISTENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to things that awaken one’s desires or prompt one to act upon them possibly against one’s will. <B><FONT color=blue>Tempt</FONT></B> emphasizes the awakening of desire despite an initial reluctance; this my result from something that is appealing by its nature or from a deliberate attempt at arousal: a steaming apple pie that <I><FONT color=brown>tempted</FONT></I> him to disregard his diet; a woman who used all her wiles to <I><FONT color=brown>tempt</FONT></I> him into following her. <B><FONT color=blue>Seduce</FONT></B> stresses someone who is prompted to action or permission against his will: <I><FONT color=brown>seduced</FONT></I> by the excitement of the city I had so hated at first. The sexual connotation possible for <I><FONT color=brown>tempt</FONT></I> is insistently present in <I><FONT color=brown>seduce</FONT></I>: boasting about how many woman he had <I><FONT color=brown>seduced</FONT></I>. If this is not borne in mind, the word can be misleading in other contexts: not the first woman who had been <I><FONT color=brown>seduced</FONT></I> by his good looks and soft-spoken manner.</P><P>The sexual connotations of both <B><FONT color=blue>attract</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>allure</FONT></B> are less insistent and obtrusive than in the foregoing words. <I><FONT color=brown>Attract</FONT></I> may give an objective tone in pointing to the winning of notice for any reason: an eccentric costume that <I><FONT color=brown>attracted</FONT></I> disapproving comment; a signal fire that might <I><FONT color=brown>attract</FONT></I> rescuers. In the context of desire, the word suggests being drawn to something because of its intrinsic appeal; no reluctance need be implied on the part of the beholder, no design on the part of the beheld: a vivacity and beauty that <I><FONT color=brown>attracted</FONT></I> every eye in the room; <I><FONT color=brown>attracted</FONT></I> to the woman who stood alone on the boat deck. <I><FONT color=brown>Allure</FONT></I> suggests greater intensity of appeal than <I><FONT color=brown>attract</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>allured</FONT></I> by the breathtaking view that opened out as they climbed. The word may suggest also a deliberate effort to <I><FONT color=brown>tempt</FONT></I> someone against his will, even to the point of using deception: barkers who <I><FONT color=brown>allure</FONT></I> passers-by into the sideshows by promising spectacles never encountered, once inside.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lure</FONT></B> is closely related to allure, but concentrates mostly on deliberate or deceptive attempts to influence someone or lead him astray, often for fraudulent or destructive purposes: cheese with which to <I><FONT color=brown>lure</FONT></I> mice into the trap; <I><FONT color=brown>luring</FONT></I> him into a lane where her confederate could rob him. The word can, of course, be used more innocently in a hyperbolic way: wondering how she could <I><FONT color=brown>lure</FONT></I> him into accepting an invitation for dinner. <B><FONT color=blue>Entice</FONT></B> also suggests a deliberate effort to tempt someone into action, but the word is vaguer about intent and motivation: hoping to <I><FONT color=brown>entice</FONT></I> him into joining their discussion group; psychopaths who <I><FONT color=brown>entice</FONT></I> children to come for rides in their cars. The word can also be used more simply of appeal: <I><FONT color=brown>enticed</FONT></I> by her lively interest in foreign films. <B><FONT color=blue>Beguile</FONT></B> once referred more exclusively to deceptive attempts to lead astray for unworthy purposes: <I><FONT color=brown>beguiled</FONT></I> by his promise of a quick profit. The word has lost much of this negative force in uses that compare with <I><FONT color=brown>attract</FONT></I>: hoping to <I><FONT color=brown>beguile</FONT></I> him with her knowledge of sport; an exuberance and zaniness in him that she found <I><FONT color=brown>beguiling</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Attraction">ATTRACTION</A>, <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Erotic">EROTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Pleasing">PLEASING</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: chill, dampen, <A href="entry://Discourage">DISCOURAGE</A>, dissuade, repel.</P>

<P>These adjectives stress brevity in speech or writing, the avoidance of any wasted words. <B><FONT color=blue>Terse</FONT></B> goes back to a Latin verb meaning to rub off or rub down. By etymology, it suggests polished style as well as pointed phrasing, implying elegance as well as economy of expression: a <I><FONT color=brown>terse</FONT></I>, vigorous style. In present use, terse emphasizes extreme compactness, concentrated force and a strict sticking to the point: a <I><FONT color=brown>terse</FONT></I> note of dismissal with no explanation. <B><FONT color=blue>Laconic</FONT></B> literally means like a Spartan, with reference to the habitual terseness of Spartan speech. A <I><FONT color=brown>laconic</FONT></I> speaker is so sparing with words as to seem stingy or exceptionally self-controlled. [He was reserved and <I><FONT color=brown>laconic</FONT></I>, a close-mouthed man; She said with laconic brevity, "We’ve lost."] Both a terse and a <I><FONT color=brown>laconic</FONT></I> remark may be so brief as to seem curt. But where a <I><FONT color=brown>terse</FONT></I> remark is complete and its brevity may be due to the pressure of circumstances, a <I><FONT color=brown>laconic</FONT></I> remark may be puzzling and may suggest a deliberate taciturnity: a <I><FONT color=brown>terse</FONT></I> battlefield command; "Trust me" was his <I><FONT color=brown>laconic</FONT></I> reply. <I><FONT color=brown>Terse</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>laconic</FONT></I> imply a certain austerity of utterance, but <B><FONT color=blue>succinct</FONT></B> suggests a more reasonable rationing of words. <I><FONT color=brown>Succinct</FONT></I> comes from Latin roots meaning to gird underneath. It implies compression, the avoidance of elaboration, the exclusion of extraneous detail. Hence a <I><FONT color=brown>succinct</FONT></I> statement is brief, clear and concise, being confined to main points or essential meaning: a <I><FONT color=brown>succinct</FONT></I> summary of a lengthy treatise.</P><P>The remaining adjectives emphasize content. <B><FONT color=blue>Pithy</FONT></B> literally means full of pith, and pith is the essential part of anything ?the tissue at the centre of a stem, the marrow of a bone. Hence a <I><FONT color=brown>pithy</FONT></I> remark is one full of meaning and substance; it is both brief and forceful, containing the gist of a matter in concentrated form: a <I><FONT color=brown>pithy</FONT></I> aphorism; the <I><FONT color=brown>pithy</FONT></I> couplets of Alexander Pope. <B><FONT color=blue>Compendious</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>pithy</FONT></I>, stresses substance, but substance drawn from many sources and summarized. A <I><FONT color=brown>compendious</FONT></I> work is both brief and comprehensive, encompassing and condensing a great mass of material: a <I><FONT color=brown>compendious</FONT></I> account of the Koran War; It required a true scholar to digest so much material and organize it into so <I><FONT color=brown>compendious</FONT></I> an introduction. <B><FONT color=blue>Sententious</FONT></B> comes from a Latin word meaning opinion. It indicates the condensing of general truths or moral principles into pithy maxims or aphorisms: the <I><FONT color=brown>sententious</FONT></I> wisdom of the Book of Proverbs. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>sententious</FONT></I> may connote a moralizing attitude or a pompous, all-knowing tone: a speaker too <I><FONT color=brown>sententious</FONT></I> not to be tiresome.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Compact">COMPACT</A>, <A href="entry://Shorten">SHORTEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: lengthy, <A href="entry://Talkative">TALKATIVE</A>, tedious, <A href="entry://Verbose">VERBOSE</A>.</P>

<P>These words may all denote statements made to a court of law. <B><FONT color=blue>Testimony</FONT></B> is any declaration made by a witness who is considered to know the facts of a case. Giving <I><FONT color=brown>testimony</FONT></I> involves the taking of an oath and the making of statements in open court in answer to question put by a lawyer or qualified public official. <I><FONT color=brown>Testimony</FONT></I> in its wider meaning is affirmation or proof of something; The ruined buildings of the city bear grim <I><FONT color=brown>testimony</FONT></I> to the heavy bombardment by the enemy.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>affidavit</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>deposition</FONT></B> are types of legal <I><FONT color=brown>testimony</FONT></I> put into writing. Although occasionally used interchangeably, <I><FONT color=brown>affidavit</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>deposition</FONT></I> differ in several ways. An <I><FONT color=brown>affidavit</FONT></I> is a sworn document made voluntarily without cross-examination. Also, an <I><FONT color=brown>affidavit</FONT></I> may be accepted a <I><FONT color=brown>testimony</FONT></I> by a court when the testifier is unable to appear in person. A <I><FONT color=brown>deposition</FONT></I>, on the other hand, is made orally under oath in response to formal questioning, and is taken down in writing. Unlike an <I><FONT color=brown>affidavit</FONT></I>, a <I><FONT color=brown>deposition</FONT></I> is subject to cross-examination.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Evidence</FONT></B> is the most general term, and it includes the <I><FONT color=brown>testimony</FONT></I> of witnesses, <I><FONT color=brown>affidavits</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>depositions</FONT></I> and all the facts and physical objects connected with a legal proceeding. In everyday use, <I><FONT color=brown>evidence</FONT></I> is anything that tends to prove a thing true. [Scholars have been able to unearth some <I><FONT color=brown>evidence</FONT></I> as to the true authorship of the book; Her red eyes and sad expression were <I><FONT color=brown>evidence</FONT></I> (and also <I><FONT color=brown>testimony</FONT></I> to the fact) that she had been crying.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Reasoning">REASONING</A>.</P>

<P>These words have either a direct reference to the theatre or are used to describe persons and things that exhibit qualities associated with the theatre. <B><FONT color=blue>Theatrical</FONT></B> is used to describe anything connected with the world of the theatre: a <I><FONT color=brown>theatrical</FONT></I> festival; a <I><FONT color=brown>theatrical</FONT></I> booking agency. It also connotes artificiality and show: His long hair and old-fashioned attire gave him a vaguely <I><FONT color=brown>theatrical</FONT></I> air that was sometimes interesting but more often just eccentric. Since it pertains especially to actors or their performing techniques, <B><FONT color=blue>histrionic</FONT></B> has the most limited application: Her <I><FONT color=brown>histrionic</FONT></I> abilities are more at home before the camera than on the stage. The word, by extension, is used to suggest the showy or affectedly emotional qualities one thinks of in connection with actors and acting: His <I><FONT color=brown>histrionic</FONT></I> display at the funeral was in thoroughly bad taste. <B><FONT color=blue>Flamboyant</FONT></B> originally meant extravagantly ornate or elaborately styled: a house with <I><FONT color=brown>flamboyant</FONT></I> architectural detail; an essay complicated by <I><FONT color=brown>flamboyant</FONT></I> prose. In a generalization of meaning, the word came to imply brilliance or boldness and finally to suggest the same kind affectation and showiness that <I><FONT color=brown>histrionic</FONT></I> does: the <I><FONT color=brown>flamboyant</FONT></I> foliage of autumn; a <I><FONT color=brown>flamboyant</FONT></I> style of dress; a <I><FONT color=brown>flamboyant</FONT></I> display of temper.</P><P>In its implication of an affected or showy manner, <B><FONT color=blue>dramatic</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>histrionic</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>flamboyant</FONT></I>: She set all tongues wagging with her <I><FONT color=brown>dramatic</FONT></I> entrance at the party. More than the other words, it has direct pertinence to the drama and to things that are suitable to or characterize acting: a <I><FONT color=brown>dramatic</FONT></I> performance of the highest calibre; The short story was <I><FONT color=brown>dramatic</FONT></I> without being in the least sentimental.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Camp</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>campy</FONT></B> were once restricted in use as homosexual argot to describe the supposedly tell-tale mannerisms of this in-group; the word suggested behaviour that was <I><FONT color=brown>theatrical</FONT></I>, artificial, exaggerated, effeminate or ostentatious. Recently these terms have become fad words that need not refer to homosexuality at all, but can be applied to any manifestation of popular culture that is so incredibly artificial, banal or vulgar as to merit amazement or admiration: <I><FONT color=brown>campy</FONT></I> Joan Crawford films from the 1930s; a <I><FONT color=brown>camp</FONT></I> feather boa that she evidently thought was the last word in chic. These words can now describe, also, deliberate attempts to reproduce such meretricious qualities in serious art or literature. In fact, the words are in danger of being used so vaguely and broadly as to vitiate their usefulness.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Emotion">EMOTION</A>, <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: colourless, drab, dull, prosaic, <A href="entry://Sedate">SEDATE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to a person who steals property that rightfully belongs to others. <B><FONT color=blue>Thief</FONT></B> is the most general, since it can refer to any such action regardless of the means used: the <I><FONT color=brown>thief</FONT></I> who had broken into the house during their absence; the <I><FONT color=brown>thief</FONT></I> who had seized her purse and darted into the milling crowd. At its most specific, <I><FONT color=brown>thief</FONT></I> might most often suggest someone who takes property by stealth, rather than by a direct confrontation with the owner. <B><FONT color=blue>Robber</FONT></B> may be used in as general a way as <I><FONT color=brown>thief</FONT></I>, but because it relates closely to the legally defined crime of robbery, it may suggest a direct confrontation in which the victim is forced to surrender this valuables by the use or threat of violence: fearing that he might be accosted by a <I><FONT color=brown>robber</FONT></I> if he walked through the dark, deserted part. A <B><FONT color=blue>burglar</FONT></B> is one who breaks into a house at night to loot it, usually with the intention of avoiding a confrontation with those living there.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brigand</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pirate</FONT></B> refer to members of organized bands that are devoted to robbery and live outside the law. <I><FONT color=brown>Brigand</FONT></I> would be typically applied to thieves whose sphere of operations is a rural area and who terrorize the surrounding countryside; <I><FONT color=brown>pirates</FONT></I> are historically represented as having fast ocean-going ships to run down and loot other ships on the high seas. <B><FONT color=blue>Gangster</FONT></B> is the equivalent term for the member of a modern-day organized group of people based mostly in cities and set up to make money by all kinds of illegal activities.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bandit</FONT></B> is the most vague of these words; it is now less used as a generic term, but is sometimes used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>brigand</FONT></I>, suggesting an organized group in a rural setting, such as bushrangers in 19<SUP>th</SUP>-century Australia. It may also be used of a lone marauder or <I><FONT color=brown>robber</FONT></I>, with the same sort of rural setting implied. In this case, theft by the use of threat or violence is suggested. The <I><FONT color=brown>bandit</FONT></I> in a typical Western movie, for example, rides a horse and goes armed, either alone or in a group.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Renegade">RENEGADE</A>.</P>

<P>These words mean the opposite of fat or plump, describing persons whose weight is low in proportion to their height. <B><FONT color=blue>Thin</FONT></B> is the most general word. It suggests a lack of girth, a narrowness of frame, and may apply either to natural low weight or underweight: a tall, <I><FONT color=brown>thin</FONT></I>, distinguished-looking man; thin and weak after a bout of illness. <I><FONT color=brown>Thin</FONT></I> in itself is simply descriptive of appearance, but is often qualified by adverbs that express the degree of thinness or the attitude concerning it: too <I><FONT color=brown>thin</FONT></I>; terribly <I><FONT color=brown>thin</FONT></I>; pitifully <I><FONT color=brown>thin</FONT></I>. Like <I><FONT color=brown>thin</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>lean</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>spare</FONT></B> may have either positive or negative connotations. Both these words stress the absence of fatty tissue: a <I><FONT color=brown>lean</FONT></I> and hungry look. At the same time, both imply an underlying muscular strength ?a sinewy and sometimes vigorous self-discipline: a <I><FONT color=brown>lean</FONT></I>, lithe runner with great stamina; a soldier’s spare build and fine bearing. <I><FONT color=brown>Lean</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>spare</FONT></I> may be expressive also of hardship and deprivation, suggesting the strength to endure hard times with a minimum of sustenance: the old prospector’s <I><FONT color=brown>lean</FONT></I>, hard frame; the <I><FONT color=brown>spare</FONT></I> form and weather-beaten face of the farmer’s wife. In extended senses, <I><FONT color=brown>lean</FONT></I> may mean fraught with want or hardship, not prosperous or productive: <I><FONT color=brown>lean</FONT></I> years. <I><FONT color=brown>Spare</FONT></I> can mean not plentiful, meagre: a <I><FONT color=brown>spare</FONT></I> meal of baked beans.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Svelte</FONT></B> implies trimness and elegance of figure, and is often used in a complimentary way rather than as pure description: She slimmed down tremendously and looked positively <I><FONT color=brown>svelte</FONT></I>. This use is suggested by the word’s derivation from Latin roots meaning to pluck out. <B><FONT color=blue>Willowy</FONT></B> suggests a <I><FONT color=brown>lean</FONT></I> build marked by suppleness and grace: a modern dancer bending her <I><FONT color=brown>willowy</FONT></I> frame. <I><FONT color=brown>Svelte</FONT></I> is feminine in connotation and is always applied to women: <I><FONT color=brown>willowy</FONT></I> is not invariably applied to either sex, but since gracefulness is more common among women it is more often associated with them.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Slim</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>slender</FONT></B> refer to relatively slight bodily weight, especially as it appears aesthetically to an observer. <I><FONT color=brown>Slim</FONT></I>, which may apply to either sex, implies a trim figure or physique. It is most often used in the context of someone’s losing or maintaining weight: She kept <I><FONT color=brown>slim</FONT></I> by dieting and by exercising diligently. <I><FONT color=brown>Slender</FONT></I>, as applied to girls or women, often connotes gracefulness, litheness, frailty or fragility: a <I><FONT color=brown>slender</FONT></I> slip of a girl. <I><FONT color=brown>Slender</FONT></I> may be used of men also, in which case the word retains a suggestion of slightness of physique that is not considered unattractive or effeminate; often the term is complimentary, but, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>slim</FONT></I> suggests firmness and strength, <I><FONT color=brown>slender</FONT></I> indicates lightness: a tall, <I><FONT color=brown>slender</FONT></I> man with a sensitive face. <I><FONT color=brown>Slender</FONT></I> is often applied to parts of the body: a <I><FONT color=brown>slender</FONT></I> wrist; <I><FONT color=brown>slender</FONT></I> arms.</P><P>A person who is considered much too <I><FONT color=brown>thin</FONT></I> may be called <B><FONT color=blue>skinny</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Skinny</FONT></I> is a rather informal term, a child’s word, always blunt and sometimes humorous or touching: a <I><FONT color=brown>skinny</FONT></I> little man. <I><FONT color=brown>Skinny</FONT></I> stresses the idea that a person is underdeveloped ?nothing but skin and bone: a <I><FONT color=brown>skinny</FONT></I>, knobby-kneed little girl; tall, <I><FONT color=brown>skinny</FONT></I> models. <I><FONT color=brown>Skinny</FONT></I> may imply also a lack of strength or vigour: a <I><FONT color=brown>skinny</FONT></I> weakling who took a body-building course. <B><FONT color=blue>Scrawny</FONT></B> means small and stringy, lean, bony and undernourished: <I><FONT color=brown>scrawny</FONT></I> urchins scrambling for coins. <I><FONT color=brown>Scrawny</FONT></I> is often found in the expression, a <I><FONT color=brown>scrawny</FONT></I> neck; it is applied to animals as well as humans: a <I><FONT color=brown>scrawny</FONT></I> chicken, too tough to eat. <B><FONT color=blue>Wiry</FONT></B> is usually used of persons, meaning <I><FONT color=brown>thin</FONT></I> but tough and sinewy.

One can <I><FONT color=brown>think</FONT></I> profoundly or superficially, seriously or frivolously: to <I><FONT color=brown>think</FONT></I> about whether man’s fate is determined by his own free will or by the force of circumstances; She <I><FONT color=brown>thought</FONT></I> about dyeing her hair red. <B><FONT color=blue>Cogitate</FONT></B> is a rather pompously formal word that means to think seriously or continuously; it is often used jestingly: The infant seemed to be <I><FONT color=brown>cogitating</FONT></I> on the quality and depth of his navel. Nevertheless it is occasionally used soberly about a baffling problem: tax specialists <I><FONT color=brown>cogitating</FONT></I> about how to simplify instructions to the taxpayer.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Meditate</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>muse</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>reflect</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ruminate</FONT></B> mean to <I><FONT color=brown>think</FONT></I> in a contemplative or leisurely manner. <I><FONT color=brown>Meditate</FONT></I> is the most general of these words, and implies a serious and extended period of concentration: The author <I><FONT color=brown>meditated</FONT></I> on the theme of his book before sketching out the plot and characterization. <I><FONT color=brown>Muse</FONT></I> suggests a dreamlike, aimless or conjectural succession of thoughts. [She <I><FONT color=brown>mused</FONT></I> about whether her husband would notice her new dress: He <I><FONT color=brown>mused</FONT></I> over what he would do if he were suddenly to inherit a million dollars.] <I><FONT color=brown>Reflect</FONT></I> means to look back in a thoughtful way over what has happened: an old man <I><FONT color=brown>reflecting</FONT></I> on the changes that had taken place in the world since his youth. <I><FONT color=brown>Reflect</FONT></I> may be used also of any intellectual review: to <I><FONT color=brown>reflect</FONT></I> on the causes of student rioting. In its basic literal sense <I><FONT color=brown>ruminate</FONT></I> is applied to certain animals and means to chew the cud (food previously swallowed and regurgitate). Analogously, <I><FONT color=brown>ruminate</FONT></I> as here considered means to turn a thought over and over in the mind: a losing candidate <I><FONT color=brown>ruminating</FONT></I> on the cause of his defeat.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deliberate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ponder</FONT></B> emphasize the slow, careful process of weighing possibilities or alternative; <I><FONT color=brown>deliberate</FONT></I> stresses the slowness, and <I><FONT color=brown>ponder</FONT></I> the weighing, of possibilities. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>deliberate</FONT></I> suggests a methodical, rational process of decision-making, <I><FONT color=brown>ponder</FONT></I> points to the solemnity and difficulty of the problem, to which there may be no solution. [The jury <I><FONT color=brown>deliberated</FONT></I> four hours before bringing in a verdict; The Minister for Defence <I><FONT color=brown>pondered</FONT></I> the problem of how to maintain national security without compromising individual freedom.]</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>reason</FONT></B> is to make logical or empirical generalizations based on evidence: The prosecutor <I><FONT color=brown>reasoned</FONT></I> that the suspect’s attempt to flee was grounds for presuming guilt. <B><FONT color=blue>Speculate</FONT></B>, on the other hand, means to theorize or conjecture on the basis of little or no evidence: At present scientists can only <I><FONT color=brown>speculate</FONT></I> on the nature and extent of life outside our solar system.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Consider">CONSIDER</A>, <A href="entry://Examine">EXAMINE</A>, <A href="entry://Idea">IDEA</A>, <A href="entry://Imagination">IMAGINATION</A>, <A href="entry://Mind">MIND</A>, <A href="entry://Opinion">OPINION</A>, <A href="entry://Study">STUDY</A>, <A href="entry://Suppose">SUPPOSE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to large gatherings, especially of people. <B><FONT color=blue>Throng</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>host</FONT></B> are the most formal of these. <I><FONT color=brown>Throng</FONT></I> emphasizes a group in which the members are pressed together in a crush: a <I><FONT color=brown>throng</FONT></I> of late Christmas shoppers fighting one another to the display tables of the department store. The word can suggest also a mass of tightly grouped people moving with difficulty in the same direction: a <I><FONT color=brown>throng</FONT></I> of worshippers who followed the religious procession down the narrow cobbled streets of the town. <I><FONT color=brown>Host</FONT></I>, by contrast, suggests an archaic or Biblical tone; here the group may well be spread out in space. The word may be descriptive of an army or armed group of people: the heavenly <I><FONT color=brown>host</FONT></I> of angels who appeared to the shepherds near Bethlehem; a <I><FONT color=brown>host</FONT></I> of people spread out on the hillside in all directions; a ragged <I><FONT color=brown>host</FONT></I> of guerrillas, falling before the gunfire of well-hidden government troops. The word can suggest also any vast group of things: a <I><FONT color=brown>host</FONT></I> of reasons for disbanding the cavalry.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crowd</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>mob</FONT></B> both suggest sizeable collections of people, but both are more informal than the previous pair. Like <I><FONT color=brown>throng</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>crowd</FONT></I> can suggest congestion but is even more emphatic about disorder within the group: a confused <I><FONT color=brown>crowd</FONT></I> that gathered in the street to watch the burning house. The word is used informally to describe large audiences of any kind, even the most orderly: the large <I><FONT color=brown>crowd</FONT></I> that had turned out to hear the pianist’s farewell performance. <I><FONT color=brown>Mob</FONT></I>, by contrast, stresses disorder in a <I><FONT color=brown>crowd</FONT></I> possessed by unruly or angry emotions and implies the erupting of potential violence or a state of riot: a <I><FONT color=brown>crowd</FONT></I> that turned into a rampaging <I><FONT color=brown>mob</FONT></I> when it learned that the boy injured by the hit-and-run driver had died before reaching the hospital. As a mere hyperbole, the word can be used informally for any great number: <I><FONT color=brown>mobs</FONT></I> of friends who came to our house-warming party.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Multitude</FONT></B>, while not sharing the quaint or old-fashioned sound of <I><FONT color=brown>host</FONT></I>, gives an elevated tone in referring to an extremely large number; when the word applies to people, it specifically implies their being spread out through space: the <I><FONT color=brown>multitude</FONT></I> gathered in King’s Cross to see in the New Year. Like <I><FONT color=brown>host</FONT></I>, the word can apply also to any great amount: presenting a <I><FONT color=brown>multitude</FONT></I> of reasons for reopening the case. <B><FONT color=blue>Horde</FONT></B> refers specifically to a <I><FONT color=brown>crowd</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>mob</FONT></I> that is threatening, unkempt or unpleasant in some way: a <I><FONT color=brown>horde</FONT></I> of hungry peasants who gathered before the palace. In this context, the word suggests disorganization, fierce emotion and a motley or ragged array of people. <I><FONT color=brown>Horde</FONT></I> can refer also to a pack or swarm, as of animals or insects: a <I><FONT color=brown>horde</FONT></I> of moths that circled the night light; a <I><FONT color=brown>horde</FONT></I> of rats. Most specifically, and with a less negative tone, the word can refer to a nomadic tribe or army: the <I><FONT color=brown>horde</FONT></I> of Bedouins who camped for the night just outside the desert town.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Group">GROUP</A>, <A href="entry://Meeting">MEETING</A>, <A href="entry://People">PEOPLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to sending a hand-released projectile through the air by a swing of the arm. <B><FONT color=blue>Throw</FONT></B> carries the fewest implications about the manner in which the act is done or its emotional context: taking careful aim before he <I><FONT color=brown>threw</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>throwing</FONT></I> handfuls of grass in all directions. <B><FONT color=blue>Chuck</FONT></B> has all the connotations of <I><FONT color=brown>throw</FONT></I> but is much more informal: He <I><FONT color=brown>chucked</FONT></I> his opponent clean out of the ring. <B><FONT color=blue>Hurl</FONT></B> suggests throwing something with considerable force or ferocity, <B><FONT color=blue>heave</FONT></B> the lifting and <I><FONT color=brown>throwing</FONT></I> of something quite heavy: <I><FONT color=brown>hurling</FONT></I> stones and curses at their helpless victim; seizing a boulder and <I><FONT color=brown>heaving</FONT></I> it down on the advancing column of men. <B><FONT color=blue>Cast</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pitch</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>toss</FONT></B>, by contrast, suggest less force and greater swiftness in throwing lighter objects: <I><FONT color=brown>pitching</FONT></I> pennies into an upturned hat; <I><FONT color=brown>casting</FONT></I> his line downstream and reeling it in against the current; lazily <I><FONT color=brown>tossing</FONT></I> darts at a picture of his political opponent. <I><FONT color=brown>Cast</FONT></I> has fallen into disuse except in the context of fishing and in certain stock phrases such as <I><FONT color=brown>casting</FONT></I> a net, <I><FONT color=brown>casting</FONT></I> dice, <I><FONT color=brown>casting</FONT></I> bread upon the waters. <I><FONT color=brown>Pitch</FONT></I> is, of course, specifically used in baseball to describe the <I><FONT color=brown>throwing</FONT></I> of the ball by the pitcher to the batter. Even in other contexts, <I><FONT color=brown>pitch</FONT></I> suggests care and accuracy of aim. <B><FONT color=blue>Bowl</FONT></B> as a term used in cricket means to <I><FONT color=brown>pitch</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>hurl</FONT></I> the ball to the batsman, usually on one bounce, with the arm held fully extended, not bent at the elbow as in baseball <I><FONT color=brown>pitching</FONT></I>; otherwise the pitch would be ruled a <I><FONT color=brown>throw</FONT></I> or, more informally, a <I><FONT color=brown>chuck</FONT></I>, which is illegal. In Australia and New Zealand, <I><FONT color=brown>bowling</FONT></I> most commonly refers to the game of lawn bowls, in which a bowl is rolled over a level grass surface, or green, in order to place it as close as possible to a small ball known as a "jack," or "kitty." This is distinct from ten-pin <I><FONT color=brown>bowling</FONT></I>, which is played in an indoor <I><FONT color=brown>bowling</FONT></I> alley where the ball is rolled over a level wooden surface to strike a set of "pins." <I><FONT color=brown>Bowl</FONT></I> as a general term is current in English-speaking countries, with this sense of rolling: children <I><FONT color=brown>bowling</FONT></I> an old tyre down the road. To <B><FONT color=blue>put</FONT></B>, in the sense here considered, means to thrust or push forward with the arm, with the full force of one’s body behind the motion. The term is now used mainly of the competitive sport of putting the shot (a metal ball), an event in athletics contests: To <I><FONT color=brown>put</FONT></I> a 16-pound shot over 60 feet requires great strength, co-ordination and concentration.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Toss</FONT></B> is used almost exclusively of light objects and may suggest a haphazard movement or one in which the notion of aiming for a target is absent: <I><FONT color=brown>tossing</FONT></I> confetti at random; <I><FONT color=brown>tossing</FONT></I> aside a lock of hair that had fallen over her eyes. But <I><FONT color=brown>toss</FONT></I> may imply also the projection of an extremely heavy object, e.g., in the sport of <I><FONT color=brown>tossing</FONT></I> the caber. <I><FONT color=brown>Toss</FONT></I> is also used colloquially in the sense of defeat: It was a tough match but we <I><FONT color=brown>tossed</FONT></I> them in the finish. <B><FONT color=blue>Fling</FONT></B>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>toss</FONT></I>, does not necessarily suggest a light object, but it is otherwise similar in implying aimlessness or a forceful wildness of movement: <I><FONT color=brown>flinging</FONT></I> down his briefcase on the table and stamping upstairs. <B><FONT color=blue>Sling</FONT></B> once referred to the sudden force reminiscent of something thrown by a sling; this is less and less present as an implication of the word. It now mainly suggests inaccurate or violent movements, possibly angry ones, as in the stock phrase, <I><FONT color=brown>slinging</FONT></I> mud at you opponents.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Discard">DISCARD</A>, <A href="entry://Propel">PROPEL</A>, <A href="entry://Rotate">ROTATE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the applying of force in a hostile way so as to repel or subdue any opposing resistance. <B><FONT color=blue>Thwart</FONT></B> suggests the outwitting of an enemy or the undoing of his plans: sending troops to <I><FONT color=brown>thwart</FONT></I> the rebellion. The word often implies the use of cleverness instead of violence to attain the enemy’s defeat and suggests action taken before the enemy himself has had time to move: the scheming villain whose designs on the helpless maiden were always <I><FONT color=brown>thwarted</FONT></I> before the final curtain. The word has recently appeared frequently in a psychological context, suggesting barriers that prevent the full realization of one’s natural endowments: a generous and receptive intelligence that was <I><FONT color=brown>thwarted</FONT></I> from attaining its full scope by bad training, poor schools and lack of opportunity.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Foil</FONT></B> relates to that aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>thwart</FONT></I> that emphasizes the undoing of an enemy’s plan before any damaging action has been accomplished: <I><FONT color=brown>foiling</FONT></I> the assassination plot by placing on the throne a straw dummy dressed like the king. In some modern contexts, the word may sound melodramatic and old-fashioned. <B><FONT color=blue>Balk</FONT></B> relates to that aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>thwart</FONT></I> that emphasizes the imposing of barriers, but <I><FONT color=brown>balk</FONT></I> does not necessarily suggest the interruption of an otherwise natural or inevitable process: every effort at creative teaching <I><FONT color=brown>balked</FONT></I> by the reams of paperwork that had to be filled out each week.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Frustrate</FONT></B> in its most general context suggests the confounding of an enemy by tactics short of an open confrontation in direct battle: <I><FONT color=brown>frustrating</FONT></I> Hannibal’s drive towards the sea by hemming in his troops and engaging them in inconclusive night skirmishes. Like <I><FONT color=brown>thwart</FONT></I>, it can suggest the undoing of an enemy’s plans before he can execute them, although in this case the result is less conclusive than with <I><FONT color=brown>thwart</FONT></I>, since here it can imply merely forcing the enemy into inaction or into holding his plans in abeyance: <I><FONT color=brown>frustrating</FONT></I> every effort the prisoner made at getting word to his confederates. When the situation of enemies is not involved, the word may suggest any sort of insurmountable obstacle that reduces someone to galling inaction: talented playwrights <I><FONT color=brown>frustrated</FONT></I> by the high cost of production and the coarse commercialism of the theatrical entrepeneurs.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inhibit</FONT></B>, like one aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>frustrate</FONT></I>, suggests the forcing of something into inaction rather than a complete routing of it: <I><FONT color=brown>inhibiting</FONT></I> the wage-price spiral by an increase in taxes. Both <I><FONT color=brown>frustrate</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>inhibit</FONT></I>, however, have gained currency in a psychological context for suggesting barriers that impede normal development or prevent the realization of natural desires. <I><FONT color=brown>Frustrate</FONT></I> here suggests an insoluble conflict between two forces working upon or within a person: <I><FONT color=brown>frustrated</FONT></I> by desires he believed it would be reprehensible to satisfy. <I><FONT color=brown>Inhibit</FONT></I> here specifically suggests the weakening or damaging of normal impulses: rules so rigid as to <I><FONT color=brown>inhibit</FONT></I> any calm development of self-assurance; learning to <I><FONT color=brown>inhibit</FONT></I> those antisocial impulses that would result in injury or harm to others.</P><P>SEE; <A href="entry://Confuse">CONFUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Hinder">HINDER</A>, <A href="entry://Subdue">SUBDUE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Permit">PERMIT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to the winding and knotting of rope or a similar material round someone to prevent free movement or to the connecting of two things by such devices. <B><FONT color=blue>Tie</FONT></B> is the most general of these words in its ability to refer to either situation with the fewest specific restrictions in meaning: He <I><FONT color=brown>tied</FONT></I> up his victims with torn lengths of bedsheets; <I><FONT color=brown>tying</FONT></I> one end of the guy rope to a low-hanging branch. <B><FONT color=blue>Bind</FONT></B> also can apply in both these situations, but it specifically emphasizes a tight <I><FONT color=brown>tying</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>binding</FONT></I> and gagging his captive so that he could neither move nor speak; a string <I><FONT color=brown>binding</FONT></I> the rhubarb stalks into a bunch. <B><FONT color=blue>Truss</FONT></B> is considerably more informal than any of the other words here and is also alone in referring exclusively to the <I><FONT color=brown>tying</FONT></I> up of someone to prevent free movement: prisoners of war who had been <I><FONT color=brown>trussed</FONT></I> up back to back and guarded until the convoy arrived. The word goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>tie</FONT></I> in this sense to suggest an extremely tight, careful or uncomfortable doubling up and <I><FONT color=brown>binding</FONT></I> of the arms and legs against the body, like a fowl prepared for roasting.</P><P>The rest of these words pertain mostly to the connecting of two things by some such means as a rope or wire. Of these, <B><FONT color=blue>fasten</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>secure</FONT></B> are the most general, even when limited to connections accomplished by <I><FONT color=brown>tying</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Fasten</FONT></I> suggests a firm <I><FONT color=brown>tying</FONT></I> in which the elements connected are made incapable of independent motion: He <I><FONT color=brown>fastened</FONT></I> an arrowhead to the shaft with a tough thong. Secure emphasizes the inseparability of the elements connected, but does not suggest loss of independent movement: the ends of the hammock were <I><FONT color=brown>secured</FONT></I> to two well-spaced trees.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lash</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hitch</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>moor</FONT></B> are all considerably more specific in implication. <I><FONT color=brown>Lash</FONT></I> here is similar to <I><FONT color=brown>bind</FONT></I> in its area of meaning, stressing a firm tying together, especially in a nautical setting: <I><FONT color=brown>lashing</FONT></I> the sail to the yardarm; He <I><FONT color=brown>lashed</FONT></I> himself to the mast so that he could not respond to the singing of the Sirens. <I><FONT color=brown>Hitch</FONT></I> particularly stresses the joining together of two mobile things or vehicles: They <I><FONT color=brown>hitched</FONT></I> the stalled car to the tow-truck with a long chain. <I><FONT color=brown>Moor</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>lash</FONT></I>, has a nautical context, but it is even more specific in stressing the tying of a boat or ship to something immovable: mooring the canoe to a heavy boulder on the bank.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Connect">CONNECT</A>, <A href="entry://Shackle">SHACKLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: free, loosen, <A href="entry://Shake">SEPARATE</A>, <A href="entry://Sever">SEVER</A>, unbind.</P>

<P>These words pertain to a lack of ease in the society of others, or to fearfulness in facing new experiences. <B><FONT color=blue>Timid</FONT></B> is the most general word in the group. It points to a reluctance to assert oneself or to undertake anything new or unknown about exercising caution. [The little boy was <I><FONT color=brown>timid</FONT></I> about going to school for the first time; A <I><FONT color=brown>timid</FONT></I> driver hesitates to pass trucks and buses on the highway.] <B><FONT color=blue>Timorous</FONT></B> is a much stronger word than <I><FONT color=brown>timid</FONT></I>, although they are often used interchangeably. <I><FONT color=brown>Timorous</FONT></I> emphasizes a greater apprehension and anxiety surrounding any experience that demands daring, independence and confidence in oneself: a <I><FONT color=brown>timorous</FONT></I> young woman unable to live her own life. <I><FONT color=brown>Timorous</FONT></I> may also describe one who is easily started and seems to live in a constant state of fearfulness: a <I><FONT color=brown>timorous</FONT></I> teacher who could not control children.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Shy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bashful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>diffident</FONT></B> share the meaning of showing unobtrusiveness and embarrassment in the company of other people. <I><FONT color=brown>Shy</FONT></I> implies self-consciousness and a fear of pushing oneself forwards. The word may suggest a lack of social poise arising from inexperience: so <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I> that talking to new acquaintances made her voice tremble. <I><FONT color=brown>Shy</FONT></I> may point also to a naturally quiet and retiring nature, often not without charm: His low voice and <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I> smile soon made him a favourite among his colleagues. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I> is used of people who, because of the nature of their culture, tend to live to themselves, or to animals that evade observation by man. [The Pygmies of equatorial Africa are a <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I>, primitive group; The Australian lyre-bird is so <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I> that even bushmen rarely see one.] <I><FONT color=brown>Bashful</FONT></I> is usually applied only to children who are <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I>. The word may have somewhat humorous overtones, since it suggests the awkwardness of a youngster who has been struck speechless before strangers or who shrinks from notice behind his mother’s skirt. When used of adults, <I><FONT color=brown>bashful</FONT></I> tends to sound condescending: such a <I><FONT color=brown>bashful</FONT></I> man when he has to talk to women. <I><FONT color=brown>Diffident</FONT></I> stresses a want of confidence in one’s abilities, point of view or even general worth. Although the <I><FONT color=brown>diffident</FONT></I> person is <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I> with others, his main difficulty is a hesitancy in expressing himself or in trying new things.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Faint-hearted</FONT></B> is somewhat scornful term, since it implies not only a bumbling lack of courage but also uncertainty as to how to go about getting what one wants. Formerly the word was used of a timid or shy lover held back from declaring himself for fear of being rejected. Nowadays, it may be applied to any timidity that appears to be slightly ludicrous: too <I><FONT color=brown>faint-hearted</FONT></I> to ask for a rise in pay.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Coy</FONT></B> originally meant <I><FONT color=brown>shy</FONT></I> and was used chiefly of women who were discouraging advances from men. It now carries overtones of a feigned and consequently coquettish shyness meant to kindle amatory interest: She was <I><FONT color=brown>coy</FONT></I> over the telephone when he asked for a date, although she had flirted outrageously with him the evening before. The extended meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>coy</FONT></I> refers to a playful or sly unwillingness to reveal information or to make a statement: When I told him that I had heard rumours of his promotion, he smiled <I><FONT color=brown>coyly</FONT></I> and said nothing.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Submissive</FONT></B>, in this context, means so <I><FONT color=brown>timid</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>timorous</FONT></I> that yielding comes more easily than resisting: a housewife too <I><FONT color=brown>submissive</FONT></I> to send the fast-talking salesman on his way.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Afraid">AFRAID</A>, <A href="entry://Cowardly">COWARDLY</A>, <A href="entry://Docile">DOCILE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: audacious, <A href="entry://Brave">BRAVE</A>, confident, <A href="entry://Daring">DARING</A>, poised.</P>

<P>These words all pertain to a lessening or deletion of strength, energy or spirit. <B><FONT color=blue>Tired</FONT></B> is a general word and in itself indicates no specific degree of loss of vigour: <I><FONT color=brown>tired</FONT></I> from mowing the lawn; eyes <I><FONT color=brown>tired</FONT></I> from reading in a poor light; <I><FONT color=brown>tired</FONT></I> after swimming a 100-metre race. <B><FONT color=blue>Weary</FONT></B> is sometimes used interchangeably with <I><FONT color=brown>tired</FONT></I> to refer to a general lull in physical energy: <I><FONT color=brown>weary</FONT></I> from a long, hard day’s work. <I><FONT color=brown>Weary</FONT></I> more strongly suggests discontent and vexation arising from having put up too long with something that is, or has become, disagreeable and trying: <I><FONT color=brown>weary</FONT></I> of getting up every hour to soothe a cranky baby; <I><FONT color=brown>weary</FONT></I> of arguing with his boss; <I><FONT color=brown>weary</FONT></I> of seeing the same inane television shows every night. <I><FONT color=brown>Tired</FONT></I> also may be used in this sense: sick and <I><FONT color=brown>tired</FONT></I> of the same old, deadly routine.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fatigued</FONT></B> implies a painful reduction of strength, as by nervous strain, illness or overwork. It is more precise than <I><FONT color=brown>tired</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>weary</FONT></I>: After his harrowing experience of being trapped in the mine, he became easily <I><FONT color=brown>fatigued</FONT></I>. As a symptom of a low state of health, <I><FONT color=brown>fatigued</FONT></I> is preferred to the other words: getting up in the morning as <I><FONT color=brown>fatigued</FONT></I> as he had been the night before. In the sense of bored or <I><FONT color=brown>weary</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>fatigued</FONT></I> may function in a more formal and literary way: Mozart’s music gave him a sense of elation, while he was <I><FONT color=brown>fatigued</FONT></I> by Brahm’s brooding lyricism.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Exhausted</FONT></B> implies the utter draining of strength and energy, which may be restored by long rest or may be irreversible: too <I><FONT color=brown>exhausted</FONT></I> to eat his dinner; <I><FONT color=brown>exhausted</FONT></I> by the hustle and bustle of city life; on his 90<SUP>th</SUP> birthday, <I><FONT color=brown>exhausted</FONT></I> and dying of old age. <B><FONT color=blue>Beat</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pooped</FONT></B> are informal terms for exhausted, but are loosely used and carry no precise meaning. One can say “I’m <I><FONT color=brown>beat</FONT></I>” or I’m <I><FONT color=brown>pooped</FONT></I>,” whether genuinely exhausted or simply tired of a particular job. In referring to genuine but temporary physical exhaustion, beat is probably the stronger of the two.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Worn out</FONT></B> carries over to this context some of its more usual meaning of having been used to the point where value or effectiveness has been lost. Here it is informal and may cover the range of meanings from <I><FONT color=brown>tired</FONT></I> to <I><FONT color=brown>exhausted</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>worn out</FONT></I> from years of toiling on a rocky, unproductive farm. Generally, the word is loosely applied to any state of lagging energy or patience: <I><FONT color=brown>worn out</FONT></I> from playing nine holes of golf; <I><FONT color=brown>worn out</FONT></I> from listening to the constant quarrelling in the flat next door.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Uninvolved">BORED</A>, <A href="entry://Listless">LISTLESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: invigorated, refreshed, relaxed, rested, strengthened.</P>

<P>These words refer to the major intent of a given speech or piece of writing. <B><FONT color=blue>Topic</FONT></B> presents the greatest variety of possible meanings. It can refer to the whole intent of a complete piece or utterance or it can refer to the point of a single sentence or paragraph within such a piece: the <I><FONT color=brown>topic</FONT></I> of his inaugural address; the <I><FONT color=brown>topic</FONT></I> of every paragraph being carefully introduced in its first sentence.

And, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>topic</FONT></I> usually refers to what is explicit, stated or intentional, <I><FONT color=brown>subject</FONT></I> may also refer either to what is implied by the speaker or writer or to what can be inferred by his audience; the <I><FONT color=brown>subject</FONT></I> on which he chose to speak; unconscious references to violence that were a constant <I><FONT color=brown>subject</FONT></I> of his talk. <B><FONT color=blue>Theme</FONT></B> refers more often to the main attitudes and argument underlying a chosen <I><FONT color=brown>subject</FONT></I> and that unify the <I><FONT color=brown>topics</FONT></I> selected to illustrate it: His <I><FONT color=brown>subject</FONT></I> was poverty, but the <I><FONT color=brown>theme</FONT></I> he held to was the futility of attempting to cure it through haphazard methods. <I><FONT color=brown>Theme</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>subject</FONT></I>, may refer to something explicitly or implicitly present: asking if she were aware that all her dreams seemed an expression of the same <I><FONT color=brown>theme</FONT></I>. The word can refer also to any tone or attitude that gives unity to some variety of examples collected to make a point; this may be true of any collection, written or otherwise: a group of essays whose <I><FONT color=brown>theme</FONT></I> was the will of man to endure; a one-man show of paintings whose <I><FONT color=brown>theme</FONT></I> was the vulgarity of modern life.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Burden</FONT></B>, by way of its reference to the refrain of a song, can indicate something frequently repeated or dwelt on as a prevailing <I><FONT color=brown>theme</FONT></I>: Antony’s mocking phrase, calling Brutus an honourable man, becomes the <I><FONT color=brown>burden</FONT></I> of his oration. By way of its reference to a heavy weight, the word is often taken in the context of discourse to suggest a consequential, weighty or solemn <I><FONT color=brown>topic</FONT></I>, but even in this case, repetition is still implied: the needless loss of life that was the <I><FONT color=brown>burden</FONT></I> of several editorials. <B><FONT color=blue>Matter</FONT></B> and the more commonly used <B><FONT color=blue>subject matter</FONT></B> are like <I><FONT color=brown>subject</FONT></I> in designating anything that is the object of a discussion, concern, feeling, etc.: doing research on the <I><FONT color=brown>subject matter</FONT></I> to be discussed in his next day’s philosophy class. Both are often used to distinguish the actual content of a discourse or piece of writing from its verbal decoration and rhetorical flourishes: less manner and more <I><FONT color=brown>matter</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Basis">BASIS</A>, <A href="entry://Kernel">KERNEL</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>totter</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>lurch</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>reel</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stagger</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>teeter</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>wobble</FONT></B>:

<P>These words denote unsteady movement resulting from insecure balance. <B><FONT color=blue>Totter</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>teeter</FONT></B> would seem interchangeably close in their reference to the in-place movement of an object that is in an unstable position: a plate that <I><FONT color=brown>teetered</FONT></I> on the edge of the table before crashing to the floor; watching nervously while the statue <I><FONT color=brown>tottered</FONT></I> on its pedestal. But <I><FONT color=brown>teeter</FONT></I> carries a suggestion of the height of an impending fall while <I><FONT color=brown>totter</FONT></I> implies that when an object falls, it falls no farther than its base: <I><FONT color=brown>teetering</FONT></I> at the head of the stairs before tumbling down; a drunken man who <I><FONT color=brown>tottered</FONT></I> to the floor. <I><FONT color=brown>Totter</FONT></I> can refer also to unsteady movement along a path, especially suggesting the instability resulting from old age or weakness; the old man who came <I><FONT color=brown>tottering</FONT></I> along; the <I><FONT color=brown>tottering</FONT></I> steps of a baby learning to walk.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lurch</FONT></B> can suggest one sudden, violent movement through space, especially a change in the rate or direction of movement already under way: expecting the aircraft to <I><FONT color=brown>lurch</FONT></I> as it hit the pocket of warm air. The word can suggest also the irregular movement or walk of a person who is drunk, disabled or disoriented in some way: <I><FONT color=brown>lurching</FONT></I> dizzily up the stairs. <B><FONT color=blue>Reel</FONT></B> can indicate an irregular motion, like <I><FONT color=brown>lurch</FONT></I>, or a recoil from an impact that causes one to sprawl out or fall back: a <I><FONT color=brown>lurch</FONT></I> of the train that sent me reeling across the aisle; <I><FONT color=brown>reeling</FONT></I> under the enemy’s counter-attack. Like <I><FONT color=brown>totter</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>wobble</FONT></B> can suggest both the unsteady in-place motion of an object and an ungainly walk. Used of an object, the word need not suggest the precarious placement implicit in both <I><FONT color=brown>totter</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>teeter</FONT></I>; it can refer, instead, to a slight back-and-forth rocking motion resulting from uneven support: a short leg that caused the table to <I><FONT color=brown>wobble</FONT></I>. The word can suggest, too, any irregularity of continuing motion: a turntable that <I><FONT color=brown>wobbled</FONT></I> badly at low speeds. Where <I><FONT color=brown>totter</FONT></I> suggests age as the possible cause of an unsteady walk, <I><FONT color=brown>wobble</FONT></I> tends to suggest fatness or a misproportioned squatness of build: a fat man who <I><FONT color=brown>wobbled</FONT></I> slowly down the street. <B><FONT color=blue>Stagger</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>reel</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>lurch</FONT></I>, can refer to an abnormal or grotesque walk, suggesting the unsteady gait and uncertain balance of some one who is drunk or semi-conscious: sleepily <I><FONT color=brown>staggering</FONT></I> to the ringing telephone; addicts who <I><FONT color=brown>stagger</FONT></I> into a hospital asking for help.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Precarious">PRECARIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Vibrate">VIBRATE</A>, <A href="entry://Walk">WALK</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to established patterns or instances of typical behaviour of a group, community or culture. <B><FONT color=blue>Tradition</FONT></B> in its broadcast sense refers to knowledge and doctrines as well as patterns of behaviour transmitted from generation to generation. More specifically, <I><FONT color=brown>tradition</FONT></I> means a particular observance so long continued that it has almost the force of law: the <I><FONT color=brown>tradition</FONT></I> calling for the Governor-General to declare Parliament in session. <B><FONT color=blue>Custom</FONT></B> refers to the habitual pattern of behaviour of a community or people. A <I><FONT color=brown>custom</FONT></I>, while well established in usage, does not have the force of a <I><FONT color=brown>tradition</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>tradition</FONT></I> emphasizes more strongly historical significance: the <I><FONT color=brown>custom</FONT></I> of shaking hands; the <I><FONT color=brown>tradition</FONT></I> by which the bridegroom places the wedding ring on the finger of his bride.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>convention</FONT></B> is a rule or approved technique, and is applied to the arts as well as to conduct: the <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I> in the Elizabethan theatre of employing boys to enact the roles of women; the <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I> of wearing a coat and tie to business; dinners flouting <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I> by drinking white wine with steak. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>custom</FONT></I> suggests a long-standing cultural habit relatively independent of the influence of ephemeral fashions, a <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I> might be considered an expression of the manners of a people, manners in this sense referring not to etiquette but he modes of social behaviour prevailing in a group during a particular period. Observing <I><FONT color=brown>convention</FONT></I> therefore implies a measure of conformity, even if unconscious, whereas observing a custom implies only the enacting of a habit shared with a great many other people. <B><FONT color=blue>Manners</FONT></B> in the sense here considered is often applied to literary works; a novel of <I><FONT color=brown>manner</FONT></I> is a novel describing the social attitudes and behaviour of a group of people ?often a stratum of society ?in a given place at a given time. <I><FONT color=brown>Manner</FONT></I>, on the other hand, refers to a typical or customary way of doing something, especially a characteristic style used in one of the arts: painted in the <I><FONT color=brown>manner</FONT></I> of Rubens. <B><FONT color=blue>Practice</FONT></B> refers to a usual way of acting, working or behaving ?in short, a <I><FONT color=brown>custom</FONT></I> ?but, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>custom</FONT></I>, it implies a voluntary choice: the whalers?practice of discarding the fins; the traditional university practice of insisting on certain minimum entrance qualifications. In a related sense <I><FONT color=brown>practice</FONT></I> refers to individual habit: it was his practice to read several books a week on a variety of subjects.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ethos</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>mores</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>folklore</FONT></B> are terms most often encountered in sociological contexts. <I><FONT color=brown>Ethos</FONT></I> means the underlying and distinctive character or spirit of a people, group or culture. The <I><FONT color=brown>ethos</FONT></I> of a group is seldom recognized by the members of that group, but it is nevertheless implicit in their <I><FONT color=brown>manners</FONT></I> and finds expression in their <I><FONT color=brown>folklore</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Folklore</FONT></I> is not restricted to behavioural patterns, but applies also to the study of customary patterns of thought and emotional attitude, and is thus more closely allied to <I><FONT color=brown>tradition</FONT></I> than to <I><FONT color=brown>manners</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Mores</FONT></I> refers to the established, traditional <I><FONT color=brown>customs</FONT></I> regarded by a social group as essential to its preservation and welfare: the Christian <I><FONT color=brown>mores</FONT></I> of marriage and family life; ascetic Puritan <I><FONT color=brown>mores</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Mores</FONT></I> is often used to refer to any prevalent moral attitudes or social <I><FONT color=brown>customs</FONT></I>: teenage mores placing a high value on "going steady."</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://History">HISTORY</A>, <A href="entry://Rite">RITE</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in that they all refer to someone who violates or forsakes his allegiance to a government, political party, faith or other belief. <B><FONT color=blue>Traitor</FONT></B>, in its specific denotation of a person who commits treason, is the strongest, most derogatory term in this group. It designates one who makes war against his own country or gives aid and comfort to its enemies: a <I><FONT color=brown>traitor</FONT></I> who, without putting up a fight, surrendered his army to an enemy force much smaller than his own. In a less opprobrious but still disparaging way, <I><FONT color=brown>traitor</FONT></I> refers to anyone who for any cause betrays a trust, a responsibility, a position, etc: held to be a <I><FONT color=brown>traitor</FONT></I> to the upper class because he so eagerly embraced a socialist doctrine. Interestingly enough, this most critical of the four words under discussion is the only one used to express displeasure in informal situations: Imagine that <I><FONT color=brown>traitor</FONT></I> leaving the cast just before dress rehearsal.</P><P>An <B><FONT color=blue>apostate</FONT></B> is one who forsakes his religion, party or principles. It is applied especially to a person who has given up his religious faith or, even more particularly, his allegiance to some special church. In <I><FONT color=brown>apostate</FONT></I> there is no definite suggestion of the active hostility which is implicit in the strongest sense of <I><FONT color=brown>traitor</FONT></I>: an <I><FONT color=brown>apostate</FONT></I> Catholic who was never able to shake off doubts about his separation from the Church.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Turncoat</FONT></B>, more than the other terms, hints that opportunism rather than a heart-felt change of persuasion is responsible for the actions of the person who abandons an allegiance. Since personal gain or convenience is his motivation, a <I><FONT color=brown>turncoat</FONT></I> is likely to treat an allegiance lightly and change it with little or no thought and concern: a political <I><FONT color=brown>turncoat</FONT></I> who left his socialist comrades in the lurch when a conservative mood hit the country.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Deserter</FONT></B> particularly applies in the case of a soldier who violates his military obligations. He may run off from the place to which he has been assigned, or he may "desert to the enemy" ?one of the most serious of military offences.</P><P>In trade-union activities a <B><FONT color=blue>scab</FONT></B> is that type of <I><FONT color=brown>traitor</FONT></I> who does not abide by a vote to go on strike or take some other positive action against the employing authority: When we all went out this <I><FONT color=brown>scab</FONT></I> refused to join us and reported for work.</P><P>SEE; <A href="entry://Heretic">HERETIC</A>, <A href="entry://Leave">LEAVE</A> (abandon), <A href="entry://Renegade">RENEGADE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Supporter">SUPPORTER</A>.</P>

<P>These words all denote freedom violet movement or emotion. <B><FONT color=blue>Tranquil</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>calm</FONT></B> both describe an absence of turmoil and agitation, but <I><FONT color=brown>tranquil</FONT></I> implies an enduring condition, while <I><FONT color=brown>calm</FONT></I> points to a more transient one: a long, <I><FONT color=brown>tranquil</FONT></I> life; a <I><FONT color=brown>calm</FONT></I> interlude during a cyclone. In terms of personality, the words retain much of this same distinction: a <I><FONT color=brown>tranquil</FONT></I> mind given to reflection; remaining <I><FONT color=brown>calm</FONT></I> and in command of himself during the crisis.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Quiet</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>still</FONT></B>, as here considered, imply an absence of bustle and commotion as well as the secondary suggestion of consequent silence. <I><FONT color=brown>Quiet</FONT></I> is the more relative of the two terms and describes that which is peaceful and is characterized by little excitement, but which is not necessarily silent: a <I><FONT color=brown>quiet</FONT></I> fishing village; a <I><FONT color=brown>quiet</FONT></I> evening spent at home; a quiet little man who does his work unobtrusively but well. <I><FONT color=brown>Still</FONT></I> may verge on the absolute. On the one hand it emphasizes a contrast with motion: the <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I>, humid air of a January night; the <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I> face of the dead woman. On the other hand it may point to the overcoming of an inherent tendency towards movement: On Sundays the great flywheels of the power station are <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I>; The child sat <I><FONT color=brown>still</FONT></I> through the long, boring sermon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Serene</FONT></B> suggests that which is elevated above earthly turmoil: a <I><FONT color=brown>serene</FONT></I> blue sky. In referring to persons, the word implies the presence of an almost other-worldly <I><FONT color=brown>calm</FONT></I> and peace of spirit which has been reached through self-fulfilment and philosophical acceptance of what life brings, or through religious faith: a <I><FONT color=brown>serene</FONT></I> old age passed in pottering about in his garden; the <I><FONT color=brown>serene</FONT></I>, kindly face of the mother superior.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Placid</FONT></B>, when used to describe persons, indicates an untroubled, even temperament that is little given to anger or other strong emotions. The word tends to have an unfavourable connotation in suggesting a unimaginative, bovine dullness of personality: a large, <I><FONT color=brown>placid</FONT></I> girl who seemed to pass unmoved through the uncertainties of adolescence. In referring to things, <I><FONT color=brown>placid</FONT></I> point to that which is prevailingly calm and tranquil: a <I><FONT color=brown>placid</FONT></I> little lake hidden among the hills.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Undisturbed</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unruffled</FONT></B>, being negatives, are usually applied to the absence of possible superficial agitation rather than to the lack of turmoil implied by the other words in this group: The councillor appeared to be <I><FONT color=brown>unruffled</FONT></I> by the biting criticism of his opponents and <I><FONT color=brown>undisturbed</FONT></I> by their open hostility.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bland">BLAND</A>, <A href="entry://Imperturbable">IMPERTURBABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Silent">SILENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: agitated, disturbed, excited, <A href="entry://Frantic">FRANTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Nervous">NERVOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Turbulent">TURBULENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to materials that obstruct total or perfect vision but through which light can penetrate. <B><FONT color=blue>Translucent</FONT></B> may refer either to something that permits an imperfect view or to something that merely allows the passage of light with little or no view possible: the <I><FONT color=brown>translucent</FONT></I> silver of the creek through which the pebbled bottom could be seen; partitions made of <I><FONT color=brown>translucent</FONT></I> panes of frosted glass to give the occupants of each cubicle privacy. <B><FONT color=blue>Blurred</FONT></B>, by contrast, usually specifically indicates a particular point between a near-perfect view and none. This would be that point at which figures or images could be seen hazily or, possibly, distortedly through the refracting medium: wiping his hand across the <I><FONT color=brown>blurred</FONT></I> windscreen. In metaphorical uses, the word emphasizes distortion or lack of soundness: a deliberately <I><FONT color=brown>blurred</FONT></I> treatment of the issues.</P><P>The remaining words all suggest vision that is blurred because of thin intervening layers or tissues, whether spread evenly or in distorting folds. <B><FONT color=blue>Diaphanous</FONT></B> indicates the least obstruction, suggesting an extremely thin or delicate gathering of folds: a formal dress with a <I><FONT color=brown>diaphanous</FONT></I> outer sheath of organdy; <I><FONT color=brown>diaphanous</FONT></I> wisps of clouds that did nothing to mask the full force of the sun. <B><FONT color=blue>Filmy</FONT></B> suggests a greater obstruction of vision than <I><FONT color=brown>diaphanous</FONT></I>, but may apply to either an even layer or a gathering of folds: a <I><FONT color=brown>filmy</FONT></I> glaze of condensation on the cold glass. When the word refers to cloth, it resembles <I><FONT color=brown>diaphanous</FONT></I> but is less formal: stitching together yards of filmy chiffon. With <B><FONT color=blue>veiled</FONT></B>, the emphasis is on a greater obstruction of vision than <I><FONT color=brown>diaphanous</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>filmy</FONT></I>, with particular reference to a cloth designed for partial concealment, as of the face: thick clouds that <I><FONT color=brown>veiled</FONT></I> the sun.

<P>These words refer to materials that not only permit the passage of light but present no obstruction to vision. <B><FONT color=blue>Transparent</FONT></B> is the most matter-of-fact of these words, giving a tone of technical precision: a roll of <I><FONT color=brown>transparent</FONT></I> tape; frosted glass in the lower part of the window and <I><FONT color=brown>transparent</FONT></I> glass above. In metaphorical uses, the tone of the word changes drastically to emphasize what is obvious, especially when a poor attempt at deception is referred to: a <I><FONT color=brown>transparent</FONT></I> falsehood she didn’t even bother to justify. <B><FONT color=blue>Clear</FONT></B>, in reference to unobstructed vision, emphasizes freedom from blur or blemish: letting the water run until it turned clear; a <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> day. <I><FONT color=brown>Clear</FONT></I> is often simply a more informal substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>transparent</FONT></I>, but in metaphorical uses the word is in sharp contrast to <I><FONT color=brown>transparent</FONT></I> and its suggestion of obvious deception; in this case, <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> means lack of obscurity: arguments that were <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> and concise.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Limpid</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>pellucid</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>crystalline</FONT></B> are more lyrical in tone than <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>transparent</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Limpid</FONT></I> suggests a view through a refracting medium, particularly water, that is utterly unclouded and untroubled: the stillness of the limpid water on the inland side of the reef. In metaphorical uses, the word suggests simplicity or serenity: the <I><FONT color=brown>limpid</FONT></I> loveliness of her smile. <I><FONT color=brown>Pellucid</FONT></I> is lyrical, sometimes to the point of preciosity, and its stress may be on the unblemished fragility of the refracting medium: a <I><FONT color=brown>pellucid</FONT></I> soap bubble. In metaphorical use, the word is perhaps even in more danger of preciosity, referring to a remarkably <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I>, sweet or delicate quality: a choir boy’s <I><FONT color=brown>pellucid</FONT></I> soprano. <I><FONT color=brown>Crystalline</FONT></I>, in this sense, conveys the sparkling <I><FONT color=brown>transparent</FONT></I> quality of quartz or of flint glass: the <I><FONT color=brown>crystalline</FONT></I> air of mountain regions; the <I><FONT color=brown>crystalline</FONT></I> lens of the eye. In an extended sense, <I><FONT color=brown>crystalline</FONT></I> may refer to that which is either literally or figuratively clear-cut and distinctly outline: a leafless tree standing in <I><FONT color=brown>crystalline</FONT></I> sharpness against the sky; the <I><FONT color=brown>crystalline</FONT></I> clarity of his prose.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Lucid</FONT></B> is almost never used nowadays to refer in a literal sense to something that is so <I><FONT color=brown>clear</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>transparent</FONT></I> as to permit unobstructed vision. Once it was widely employed in this way in literature and poetry. Its application now is principally to treatments that are understandable and unambiguous: a <I><FONT color=brown>lucid</FONT></I> explanation of evolution; a <I><FONT color=brown>lucid</FONT></I> prose style. <I><FONT color=brown>Lucid</FONT></I> may refer also to mental processes which are clear and rational, especially in persons who may experience periods of remission from a mental illness; from time to time he would be free of delusions and hallucinations and he <I><FONT color=brown>lucid</FONT></I> for days.</P><P>SEE; <A href="entry://Flimsy">FLIMSY</A>, <A href="entry://Translucent">TRANSLUCENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Foggy">FOGGY</A>, <A href="entry://Obscure">OBSCURE</A>, <A href="entry://Vague">VAGUE</A>.</P>

It refers to a tendency or a disposition to imperil or betray another to whom one has shown apparent loyalty and goodwill: a <I><FONT color=brown>treacherous</FONT></I> co-worker who denounces one to the boss; a <I><FONT color=brown>treacherous</FONT></I> dog who bites his master. <I><FONT color=brown>Treacherous</FONT></I> may also mean simply dangerous or unreliable, especially when applied to things: roads that become <I><FONT color=brown>treacherous</FONT></I> in rainy weather; <I><FONT color=brown>treacherous</FONT></I> times in our history. <B><FONT color=blue>Disloyal</FONT></B> is the most general word, suggesting either frank or covert hostility towards anything to which one has paid allegiance: <I><FONT color=brown>disloyal</FONT></I> to the standards of his profession; situations in which political dissent is thought <I><FONT color=brown>disloyal</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Unfaithful</FONT></B> narrows its implications to one possibility in <I><FONT color=brown>disloyal</FONT></I>, being now used mainly for personal situations. A person would be <I><FONT color=brown>disloyal</FONT></I> to his country, but <I><FONT color=brown>unfaithful</FONT></I> to his wife. One aspect of <B><FONT color=blue>false</FONT></B> relates to these words, especially in the phrase, <I><FONT color=brown>false</FONT></I> friend. Here, it suggests a total or irreparable breach, as in the case of a <I><FONT color=brown>treacherous</FONT></I> friend. A <I><FONT color=brown>disloyal</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>unfaithful</FONT></I> friend, unlike a <I><FONT color=brown>false</FONT></I> friend, could conceivably have temporarily or accidentally erred and yet repent of his action later.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Specious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>hypocritical</FONT></B> both suggest a misleading contrast between appearance and reality or between stated beliefs and actions. <I><FONT color=brown>Specious</FONT></I> once suggested no more than a pleasing appearance, but now it is taken most often to mean a deliberately dissembling manner or to suggest something that seems true but proves <I><FONT color=brown>false</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>specious</FONT></I> reasoning; <I><FONT color=brown>specious</FONT></I> declarations of friendship. <I><FONT color=brown>Hypocritical</FONT></I> suggests either a conscious or unconscious discrepancy between what one claims to be and what one does. In the context of betrayal, the stress would fall on conscious dishonesty: <I><FONT color=brown>hypocritically</FONT></I> promising the electors lower taxes; <I><FONT color=brown>hypocritically</FONT></I> buying lottery tickets while preaching against gambling.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Treasonable</FONT></B> is closely related to the aspect of <I><FONT color=brown>disloyal</FONT></I> that refers specifically to betrayal of cause or country; the word is more likely to be applied to acts than to people, and sometimes suggests behaviour approaching or tantamount to treason rather than outright betrayal: insisting that the protest demonstration was not <I><FONT color=brown>treasonable</FONT></I>, either in effect or intent. <B><FONT color=blue>Traitorous</FONT></B>, the most formal of these words, may now sound slightly old-fashioned to some ears. Like <I><FONT color=brown>treasonable</FONT></I>, it is most often restricted to betrayal of one’s country. In contrast, it is most appropriately used to describe people, although it can be used of acts as well. In any case, it suggests deliberate betrayal rather than a close approach to it: a <I><FONT color=brown>traitorous</FONT></I> officer who relayed defence secrets to the enemy.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Crime">CRIME</A>.</P><P>ANOTNYMS: <A href="entry://Candid">CANDID</A>, <A href="entry://Sincere">HONEST</A>, loyal, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>, <A href="entry://Sincere">SINCERE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all mean to restore to health or soundness a diseased or injured condition, especially by means of medical attention. <B><FONT color=blue>Treat</FONT></B> is the most general word. To <I><FONT color=brown>treat</FONT></I> medically is to accept someone as a patient, to diagnose his illness and to help relieve it. [After the accident, the truck driver was <I><FONT color=brown>treated</FONT></I> for cuts and bruises; some skin diseases are difficult to <I><FONT color=brown>treat</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Treating</FONT></I> may specifically involve the prescribing of drugs, special diets, exercises, etc., or simply advice on habits of living, but all these measures involve the overall effort to restore a sick or injured person to health.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cure</FONT></B> usually applies to diseases, <I><FONT color=brown>heal</FONT></I> to injuries. [Penicillin <I><FONT color=brown>cured</FONT></I> him of pneumonia; The cut on his finger <I><FONT color=brown>healed</FONT></I> quickly.] <I><FONT color=brown>Cure</FONT></I> is sometimes used to suggest a sudden and dramatic improvement. [The blind man was miraculously <I><FONT color=brown>cured</FONT></I> at the shrine; At any moment someone may discover how to <I><FONT color=brown>cure</FONT></I> cancer.] <I><FONT color=brown>Healing</FONT></I>, on the other hand, is usually a slow process, sometimes of very long duration. It is never quick or dramatic: His injured back had been <I><FONT color=brown>healing</FONT></I> nicely until he wrenched it again yesterday. In this sense <B><FONT color=blue>mend</FONT></B> is a close synonyms, but suggests, in accordance with its literal meaning, a drawing together of parts, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>heal</FONT></I> implies simply a return to a healthy condition: His fractured wrist is <I><FONT color=brown>mending</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>healing</FONT></I>) rapidly.</P><P>In some contexts <I><FONT color=brown>heal</FONT></I> does suggest the charlatan or quack, possibly from the application of the term "healer" to medical poseurs. In other cases <I><FONT color=brown>heal</FONT></I> sounds pretentious and high-flown: A physician’s sacred duty is to <I><FONT color=brown>heal</FONT></I> the sick. <I><FONT color=brown>Cure</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>heal</FONT></I> are sometimes used figuratively: to be <I><FONT color=brown>cured</FONT></I> of coming late to breakfast; to be <I><FONT color=brown>healed</FONT></I> of old regrets.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Remedy</FONT></B> also may mean to <I><FONT color=brown>cure</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>heal</FONT></I> by medical treatment. Aspirin may <I><FONT color=brown>remedy</FONT></I> a headache, or specially fitted shoes <I><FONT color=brown>remedy</FONT></I> fallen arches. But one is more likely to say that aspirin cures a headache and that special shoes correct fallen arches. In its wider sense, remedy means to overcome a defect or undesirable state of affairs not necessarily having to do with health.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lessen">ALLEVIATE</A>, <A href="entry://Neutralize">NEUTRALIZE</A>, <A href="entry://Recover">RECOVER</A>, <A href="entry://Repair">REPAIR</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: neglect.</P>

<P>These denote types of agreements or political adjustments between two or more nations. <B><FONT color=blue>Treaty</FONT></B> is the general term for a formal, signed contract that is drawn up after diplomatic negotiations and in accordance with the rules of international law. <I><FONT color=brown>Treaties</FONT></I> may end wars, provide for the purchase of territory, or contain provisions to ensure peace. Many <I><FONT color=brown>treaties</FONT></I> are named after the places in which they are ratified: the <I><FONT color=brown>Treaty</FONT></I> of Westphalia: The <I><FONT color=brown>Treaty</FONT></I> of Versailles.</P><P>In recent times, <B><FONT color=blue>pact</FONT></B> has been frequently substituted for <I><FONT color=brown>treaty</FONT></I>: the Warsaw <I><FONT color=brown>Pact</FONT></I>; the Anzus <I><FONT color=brown>Pact</FONT></I>. In general, <I><FONT color=brown>pact</FONT></I> often suggests a less important and less binding agreement than does <I><FONT color=brown>treaty</FONT></I>. One would always refer to a decision to cease international hostilities as a <I><FONT color=brown>treaty</FONT></I>, but an agreement concerning regulation of trade between otherwise friendly countries is likely to be called a <I><FONT color=brown>pact</FONT></I>. In its wider meaning, <I><FONT color=brown>pact</FONT></I> is any convenant made between two or more persons or groups in which each agrees to carry out a certain action: a <I><FONT color=brown>pact</FONT></I> between owners of rival stores to charge fair prices; a suicide <I><FONT color=brown>pact</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Entente</FONT></B>, a shortened form of "<I><FONT color=brown>entente</FONT></I> cordiale," a French term meaning understanding, is an informal compact, rather than a treaty, between governments with reference to the conducting of foreign affairs or co-operation in the event of military aggression from without. An <I><FONT color=brown>entente</FONT></I> may or may not be set down in the form of a document; it may simply be a pledge made between heads of state.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Détente</FONT></B> suggests a more negative situation than does entente, since a <I><FONT color=brown>détente</FONT></I> is a lessening in, or a suspension of, strained relations between governments, especially after a military crisis has been narrowly averted. A <I><FONT color=brown>détente</FONT></I> may be uneasy and temporary, or it may lead eventually to an <I><FONT color=brown>entente</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Coexistence</FONT></B>, a fairly new word in diplomacy, is the simultaneous existence, through a policy of mutual non-interference, of two or more nations differing widely in ideology. <I><FONT color=brown>Coexistence</FONT></I> differs from an <I><FONT color=brown>entente</FONT></I> in that it is a more or less neutral state of affairs, often implying mere forbearance for the sake of preventing outright war. <I><FONT color=brown>Coexistence</FONT></I> may come into being after a <I><FONT color=brown>détente</FONT></I>; on the other hand, it may be the forerunner of an <I><FONT color=brown>entente</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Covenant">COVENANT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to anything that is extremely great in size, scope, scale, intensity or importance. <B><FONT color=blue>Tremendous</FONT></B> not only suggests something extraordinarily large or vast but something that is unusual, striking or astonishing in its magnitude: a <I><FONT color=brown>tremendous</FONT></I> skyscraper; issues of <I><FONT color=brown>tremendous</FONT></I> consequence for every citizen. The word is often used loosely as a hyperbole for anything one thinks of as interesting or pleasant: a <I><FONT color=brown>tremendous</FONT></I> party. <B><FONT color=blue>Prodigious</FONT></B> can refer to sheer size, but more particularly it suggests anything that is preternatural to the extent of being a prodigy or marvel; it also can be used vaguely in hyperbole: a basketball player of <I><FONT color=brown>prodigious</FONT></I> height; a <I><FONT color=brown>prodigious</FONT></I> blow to the economy. The word may refer also to something achieved with effort, or to precocious development: a <I><FONT color=brown>prodigious</FONT></I> space-age triumph; the boy’s <I><FONT color=brown>prodigious</FONT></I> ability at working differential equations. <B><FONT color=blue>Stupendous</FONT></B> could once refer to any phenomenon that staggered the mind, but it has suffered more from excessive use than the previous pair and now may seem mere overstatement: a <I><FONT color=brown>stupendous</FONT></I> film.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Colossal</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>titanic</FONT></B> both derive from references to large bodies. <I><FONT color=brown>Colossal</FONT></I> comes from the <I><FONT color=brown>Colossus</FONT></I> of Rhodes, a huge statue that was one of the wonders of the ancient world. <I><FONT color=brown>Titanic</FONT></I> refers back to the Titans, a race of giants in Greek mythology. Some echo of these origins remains in that colossal may stress monumentality, while <I><FONT color=brown>titanic</FONT></I> may stress force and power: a <I><FONT color=brown>colossal</FONT></I> façade of windows blocking the sky; a <I><FONT color=brown>titanic</FONT></I> effort to arm the nation following the sneak attack. Both are over-used as hyperboles. Like the previous pair, <B><FONT color=blue>herculean</FONT></B> has a classical origin, referring back to the hero Hercules. The world suffers less from loss of meaning through over-use, however, and can still refer not only to a powerfully built man, but to selfless labour dedicated to accomplishing seemingly insuperable tasks; this shade of meaning is also a reference to the prodigious feats of Hercules: <I><FONT color=brown>herculean</FONT></I> athletes; the <I><FONT color=brown>herculean</FONT></I> job of combating the upsurge of crime in recent times.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Thumping</FONT></B> and whopping have a colourful, informal or slangy sound that saves them from the grey vagueness to which some of these words have been reduced through over-use. <I><FONT color=brown>Thumping</FONT></I> hints at the physical sound that a large or plump object might give off or, less concretely, suggests ripeness, health or perfection: a <I><FONT color=brown>thumping</FONT></I> ten-pound baby. <B><FONT color=blue>Whopping</FONT></B> may deliberately suggest an awareness of overstatement in someone else’s hyperboles or outright lies, as in a tall tale: a <I><FONT color=brown>whopping</FONT></I> excuse for being late; a <I><FONT color=brown>whopping</FONT></I> lie. In a more general way it can refer to anything that seems forceful or decisive: a <I><FONT color=brown>whopping</FONT></I> landslide election victory over his opponent.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Husky">HUSKY</A>, <A href="entry://Large">LARGE</A>, <A href="entry://Massive">MASSIVE</A>, <A href="entry://Size">SIZE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Minute">MINUTE</A>, <A href="entry://Small">SMALL</A>, <A href="entry://Trivial">TRIVIAL</A>.</P>

<P>All these words involve the intention to deceive. <B><FONT color=blue>Trick</FONT></B> is the most general, and may apply to any device used to fool someone, whether in earnest or in fun: a mean <I><FONT color=brown>trick</FONT></I> to obtain money; prankish schoolboys?<I><FONT color=brown>tricks</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Artifice</FONT></B> has a general meaning of artistic skill or even the created work itself. One of its meanings relates it to this set of words describing expedients used to gain an end. In this sense <I><FONT color=brown>artifice</FONT></I> means something contrived especially to win out in a given situation. It has connotations of cleverness and may or may not suggest an unethical approach. [The labyrinth was an <I><FONT color=brown>artifice</FONT></I> created by Daedalus to imprison the violent Minotaur; Pretending to be a sightseer was a harmless <I><FONT color=brown>artifice</FONT></I> if it permitted him to speak to the beautiful woman in the park.]</P><P>In <B><FONT color=blue>blind</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>subterfuge</FONT></B> the element of an unethical deception or disguise is stronger. A <I><FONT color=brown>blind</FONT></I> usually involves out-and-out role-playing, whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>subterfuge</FONT></I> can be a momentary deception which invites the onlooker to mistake a person’s real intentions. [His job as a barman was simply a <I><FONT color=brown>blind</FONT></I> for conducting an illicit starting-price betting business; Her sudden illness was a <I><FONT color=brown>subterfuge</FONT></I> to prevent her son from leaving home.]</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>wile</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>ruse</FONT></B> imply cunning pretences in order to persuade, but <I><FONT color=brown>ruse</FONT></I> may be more innocuous than <I><FONT color=brown>wile</FONT></I>, which suggests taking unfair advantage. [The <I><FONT color=brown>ruse</FONT></I> of having a prior appointment permitted her to escape from the aggressive bore; All his <I><FONT color=brown>wiles</FONT></I> could not persuade her to entrust him with her money.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dodge</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>evasion</FONT></B> are much more harmless in tone, implying the avoidance of a confrontation rather than the active initiation of a false situation. [The actress quickly changed the subject ?a skilful <I><FONT color=brown>dodge</FONT></I> to avoid admitting her actual age; She had built her career on a succession of such <I><FONT color=brown>evasions</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stratagem</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>manoeuvre</FONT></B> are drawn from military parlance to describe carefully plotted offensive or defensive tactics. Both imply conscious, calculated planning. [His <I><FONT color=brown>stratagem</FONT></I> for winning her approval was to agree with everything she said; Announcing his candidacy was only a <I><FONT color=brown>manoeuvre</FONT></I> to prevent his rival from gaining the nomination.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Cheat">CHEAT</A>, <A href="entry://Deception">DECEPTION</A>, <A href="entry://Lie">LIE</A>, <A href="entry://Misleading">MISLEADING</A>, <A href="entry://Trick">TRICK</A> (V.).</P>

<P>These words refer to expressions or ideas that have lost freshness and meaning through over-use and consequently insult good taste by their superficiality, obviousness or banality. <B><FONT color=blue>Trite</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cliché</FONT></B>, while firmly negative in tone, can be used in simply description or classification without the same degree of opprobrium suggested by the rest of these words. <I><FONT color=brown>Trite</FONT></I> is milder than <I><FONT color=brown>cliché</FONT></I> but more general, referring to over-used expressions, obvious ideas or a style that relies on either or both of these: a <I><FONT color=brown>trite</FONT></I> simile comparing her teeth to pearls; a story that is beautifully written but is concerned with the <I><FONT color=brown>trite</FONT></I> theme of adolescent loneliness; the standard Australia Day speech, <I><FONT color=brown>trite</FONT></I> in both delivery and sentiment. <I><FONT color=brown>Cliché</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>clichéd</FONT></I>) in contrast more often refers to expression alone: coinages such as "promotionwise" that can become <I><FONT color=brown>cliché</FONT></I> almost over-night. Occasionally, it goes beyond these restrictions: <I><FONT color=brown>cliché</FONT></I> characters that marred an otherwise good ply. In any case, the fault of over-use indicated by <I><FONT color=brown>cliché</FONT></I> is more serious than that suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>trite</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hackneyed</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>shopworn</FONT></B> are the most critical of these words. <I><FONT color=brown>Hackneyed</FONT></I> points to expression, style and content that befit a hack writer, that is, someone hired to do routine and commercial, if not trashy, writing: the <I><FONT color=brown>hackneyed</FONT></I> jargon of movie-romance magazines. Extreme cheapness or vulgarity of expression is often indicated by the word, and possibly dullness and lack of any serious intent. Expressions might become <I><FONT color=brown>trite</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>cliché</FONT></I> by striving pathetically for elegance or loftiness, but hackneyed suggests low, narrow meanness undiluted by striving of any kind. <I><FONT color=brown>Shopworn</FONT></I> gives less opprobrium than <I><FONT color=brown>hackneyed</FONT></I>, but it vividly characterizes anything whose appeal and interest have worn out through over-use: <I><FONT color=brown>shopworn</FONT></I> political talk about a candidate’s image, his community spirits and other claptrap.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stale</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>threadbare</FONT></B> emphasize that something, now over-used, might once have been fresh or novel. Both, like shopworn, apply here metaphorically. <I><FONT color=brown>Stale</FONT></I> suggests comparison to perishable food, <I><FONT color=brown>threadbare</FONT></I> to the wearing out of cloth. <I><FONT color=brown>Stale</FONT></I> is unique in that it suggests a process of dating that need not result through excessive use: <I><FONT color=brown>stale</FONT></I> Victorianisms that are mercifully disappearing from the language. When over-use is suggested, the emphasis is on a lack of liveliness: a campaign speech that was a <I><FONT color=brown>stale</FONT></I> reiteration of respect for God, country and motherhood. <I><FONT color=brown>Threadbare</FONT></I> points to over-use that results in an expression’s ultimate meaninglessness: <I><FONT color=brown>Threadbare</FONT></I> metaphors like "kick over the traces" no longer have any meaning for most people. It should be pointed out in passing that, because of their metaphorical colourfulness, <I><FONT color=brown>shopworn</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>stale</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>threadbare</FONT></I> are themselves in danger of becoming <I><FONT color=brown>trite</FONT></I> through over-use.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stock</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stereotyped</FONT></B> suggest things mass-produced, struck from a mould or deliberately made to resemble forerunners. <I><FONT color=brown>Stock</FONT></I> may suggest a situation in which originality is not expected or desired: <I><FONT color=brown>stock</FONT></I> formulas according to which television interviews are conducted. <I><FONT color=brown>Stereotyped</FONT></I> suggests over-simplification and fixing into an unchanging form to the point of caricature, however recognizable: the <I><FONT color=brown>stereotyped</FONT></I> figure of the Highlander in whisky ads. Both words can refer to an audience’s expectation of being given the comforting or the usual, or even to the desire to see or understand something according to standard patterns: the <I><FONT color=brown>stock</FONT></I> response when the image of a cooing baby is flashed upon the screen; <I><FONT color=brown>stereotyped</FONT></I> attitudes towards minority groups that persist even in the face of plain evidence to the contrary. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>stereotyped</FONT></I> is more critical and severe in this situation.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Banal">BANAL</A>, <A href="entry://Bland">BLAND</A>, OLD-FASHIONED, <A href="entry://Superficial">SUPERFICIAL</A>, <A href="entry://Truism">TRUISM</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Creative">CREATIVE</A>, UP-TO-DATE.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in that they all mean small or insignificant. <B><FONT color=blue>Trivial</FONT></B> is used to characterize that which is ordinary or commonplace and hence of no special value or import: to interject a <I><FONT color=brown>trivial</FONT></I> remark.

That which is <B><FONT color=blue>trifling</FONT></B> is so <I><FONT color=brown>trivial</FONT></I> as to be unworthy of notice: a <I><FONT color=brown>trifling</FONT></I> distinction. The word is applied also to small amounts of money: The cost of the required books would have been <I><FONT color=brown>trifling</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Petty</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>picayune</FONT></B> are alike in their implication of small-mindedness, but <I><FONT color=brown>petty</FONT></I> has overtones of meanness and spite while <I><FONT color=brown>picayune</FONT></I> (ultimately from Provencal <I><FONT color=brown>picaioun</FONT></I> and now largely American) has special relevance to a narrow or contemptible point of view: a <I><FONT color=brown>petty</FONT></I> gossip who delighted in breaking up her sister’s romance; a <I><FONT color=brown>picayune</FONT></I> politician who hadn’t expressed a new idea in ten years of bench-warming. <I><FONT color=brown>Petty</FONT></I> can be used to describe also any small, minor or subordinate person or thing: a <I><FONT color=brown>petty</FONT></I> irritation; a <I><FONT color=brown>petty</FONT></I> officer; a <I><FONT color=brown>petty</FONT></I> theft. <I><FONT color=brown>Picayune</FONT></I> is much like <I><FONT color=brown>trivial</FONT></I> when it refers to something small: Why should we quibble about such a <I><FONT color=brown>picayune</FONT></I> sum? And it can be like <I><FONT color=brown>petty</FONT></I> in expressing a carping or fault-finding meanness: it was <I><FONT color=brown>picayune</FONT></I> of him to criticize his secretary in front of the other girls.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Paltry</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>measly</FONT></B> are derogatory and are applied to that which is contemptibly small. <I><FONT color=brown>Paltry</FONT></I> suggests that the thing it describes should be larger or greater: a <I><FONT color=brown>paltry</FONT></I> contribution to the charity. <I><FONT color=brown>Measly</FONT></I> hints at scantiness and stinginess: a <I><FONT color=brown>measly</FONT></I> serving of stew for a hungry man.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Puny</FONT></B> specifically refers to a person whose body is feeble, under-developed or weak: Poverty with its attendant miseries and inadequacies had turned a perfectly normal baby into a <I><FONT color=brown>puny</FONT></I>, neurotic child. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>puny</FONT></I> can apply to anything that is insignificant or enfeebled: a <I><FONT color=brown>puny</FONT></I> attempt to solve a problem that was too big for his knowledge and experience.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Extraneous">EXTRANEOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Marginal">MARGINAL</A>, <A href="entry://Scanty">SCANTY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Significant">SIGNIFICANT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer collectively to the men that make up a military group as distinguished from their arms and material. <B><FONT color=blue>Troops</FONT></B> is relatively informal and refers to the whole body of men in a unit or to fighting men in general. The word is more often used for land detachments rather than for naval or air units, and it is sometimes used exclusively to apply to non-commissioned men as distinct from their officers: sending <I><FONT color=brown>troops</FONT></I> into the off-shore island; officers trying to quiet the grumbling of the <I><FONT color=brown>troops</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Army</FONT></B> clearly distinguishes land troops from naval or air units, but, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>troops</FONT></I>, it clearly includes both officers and other ranks: one of the youngest colonels in the <I><FONT color=brown>army</FONT></I>; an <I><FONT color=brown>army</FONT></I> sent to put down the rebellion. <B><FONT color=blue>Soldiers</FONT></B> may loosely refer to all the men in an <I><FONT color=brown>army</FONT></I>, but more specifically it applies to those below commissioned rank, and sometimes even more strictly to men enlisted in the infantry: invading <I><FONT color=brown>soldiers</FONT></I> supported by massive artillery detachments.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>forces</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>personnel</FONT></B> are more formal, more inclusive and more abstract than the other words here. <I><FONT color=brown>Personnel</FONT></I> refers collectively to all the men in a unit, whether of an <I><FONT color=brown>army</FONT></I>, navy or air unit. It can, in fact, refer collectively to the men in all these groupings: the cancelling of leaves and discharges for all military <I><FONT color=brown>personnel</FONT></I>. The word is used in distinguishing men from <I><FONT color=brown>arms</FONT></I> or matériel. In a wider context this word can refer to the members of any kind of group or business whatsoever: the factory’s <I><FONT color=brown>personnel</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Forces</FONT></I> specifically considers collectively all the men in all branches of the military: asserting that our <I><FONT color=brown>forces</FONT></I> in the present struggle were adequate to the task at hand. The word differs from <I><FONT color=brown>personnel</FONT></I> in viewing soldiers and officers in the context of all their supporting armament and supplies: building up their military <I><FONT color=brown>forces</FONT></I> into the best-equipped and most modern in the world.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Group">GROUP</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>truism</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>bromide</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>platitude</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>saw</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to sayings that express self-evident truths or oft-repeated assumptions. <B><FONT color=blue>Truism</FONT></B> is the most neutral of these: the <I><FONT color=brown>truism</FONT></I> about the fool and his money being soon parted. Often the word refers to statements widely regarded as true or accepted as fact: early navigators setting out to disprove the <I><FONT color=brown>truism</FONT></I> that the world was flat. Since it is needless to point out what is obvious, the word can also carry a critical tone: lectures that were a mere collection of <I><FONT color=brown>truisms</FONT></I>.</P><P>In the case of <B><FONT color=blue>platitude</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>saw</FONT></B> the tone is decidedly critical. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>truism</FONT></I>, the statements referred to by these words need not be self-evident or even true; the words do suggest ideas that have been repeated so often as to be no longer vivid or meaningful. <I><FONT color=brown>Platitude</FONT></I> implies an attempt at wisdom that expresses, instead, a commonplace sententiousness: weather that made a mockery of the <I><FONT color=brown>platitude</FONT></I> about spring arriving with a rush; fathers who wish to be helpful concerning their sons?problems but can only spout embarrassed <I><FONT color=brown>platitudes</FONT></I> to them. <I><FONT color=brown>Saw</FONT></I>, refers to any well-worn saying whose point may be wit rather than wisdom, but which has become pointless through repetition or misapplication: countering her <I><FONT color=brown>saw</FONT></I> about a penny earned by quoting the one about being penny-wise but pound-foolish.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bromide</FONT></B> is the most disparaging of all these words. It denotes a stereotyped, inane remark made as though it were an original idea or observation. <I><FONT color=brown>Bromides</FONT></I> are usually uttered by people who exhibit a lack of imagination and intellectual perception: the <I><FONT color=brown>bromide</FONT></I> that it’s not what you learn in school that counts but the friends you make there.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Banal">BANAL</A>, <A href="entry://Proverb">PROVERB</A>, <A href="entry://Trite">TRITE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: witticism.</P>

trust
<B><FONT color=blue>trust</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>confidence</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>faith</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>reliance</FONT></B>:

<P>These words denote the feeling that a person or thing will not fail in loyalty, duty or service. <B><FONT color=blue>Trust</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>faith</FONT></B> suggest the greatest degree of conviction in this context. <I><FONT color=brown>Trust</FONT></I> indicates a feeling of certainty that someone or something will not fail in any situation where protection, discretion or fairness is essential: their <I><FONT color=brown>trust</FONT></I> in us to defend them if they are attacked; placing her <I><FONT color=brown>trust</FONT></I> in him to keep her secret; unwilling to put any <I><FONT color=brown>trust</FONT></I> in banks. The word emphasizes this feeling of certainty whether it is justified or misguided: an investigation proving that their <I><FONT color=brown>trust</FONT></I> in him was warranted; misplaced <I><FONT color=brown>trust</FONT></I> in a man who turned out to be a charlatan. <I><FONT color=brown>Faith</FONT></I> is an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>trust</FONT></I>, suggesting an even deeper conviction of fidelity and integrity, often in spite of no evidence whatever or even in the face of contrary evidence: <I><FONT color=brown>faith</FONT></I> in her son’s goodness despite innumerable examples of his inability to keep out of trouble; blind <I><FONT color=brown>faith</FONT></I> in his wife’s loyalty; an unquestioning <I><FONT color=brown>faith</FONT></I> in the curative powers of psychiatry. The word emphasizes such a deep-seated conviction that it is appropriate in a religious context to refer to belief based on steadfast loyalty rather than on demonstrable evidence: a simple, pious <I><FONT color=brown>faith</FONT></I> that remained unshakable in the face of every misfortune.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Confidence</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>reliance</FONT></B> more often suggest trust based on the proven reliability of someone or something. One can intuitively <I><FONT color=brown>trust</FONT></I> someone at first glance, rightly or wrongly, but <I><FONT color=brown>confidence</FONT></I> suggests a conviction born of time-tested familiarity. Also, it pertains specifically to a feeling that someone or something will not fail or behave differently from the way it has in the past: a sales record that merits the <I><FONT color=brown>confidence</FONT></I> of his employers; <I><FONT color=brown>confidence</FONT></I> in his ability to survive the crisis; a diabetic’s <I><FONT color=brown>confidence</FONT></I> in the efficacy of insulin. Sometimes the word is detached from any notion of evidence as a basis for <I><FONT color=brown>trust</FONT></I>: a buoyant <I><FONT color=brown>confidence</FONT></I> that things would somehow work out all right in time. <I><FONT color=brown>Reliance</FONT></I> is even more specific than <I><FONT color=brown>confidence</FONT></I>, pointing to an actual dependence on something else, whether out of choice or necessity: speeding along with complete <I><FONT color=brown>reliance</FONT></I> on the effectiveness of his brakes. Often it suggests the need for protection of the weak by the strong: the <I><FONT color=brown>reliance</FONT></I> of emerging countries on the foreign-aid programmes of the word’s affluent nations. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>reliance</FONT></I> indicates something that is resorted to as a solution to a specific problem: the government’s <I><FONT color=brown>reliance</FONT></I> on increased taxes to bring in more revenue to support the public-works programme.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Allegiance">ALLEGIANCE</A>, <A href="entry://Entrust">ENTRUST</A>, <A href="entry://Moral">MORAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Anxiety">ANXIETY</A>, distrust, <A href="entry://Doubt">DOUBT</A>, <A href="entry://Unbelief">UNBELIEF</A>.</P>

When applied to things, <I><FONT color=brown>reliable</FONT></I> means adequate, serviceable or true; a reference book, for example, might be called <I><FONT color=brown>reliable</FONT></I> if the information it presents is accurate. <B><FONT color=blue>Dependable</FONT></B> is akin to reliable but is a little more subjective; <I><FONT color=brown>reliable</FONT></I> is often used of relationships based on service between superiors and inferiors, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>dependable</FONT></I> more often suggests an attitude of personal allegiance rather than one of honesty or thoroughness in the performance of a duty. One goes to a dependable person confident of receiving loyalty, support or aid: a <I><FONT color=brown>dependable</FONT></I> ally.

<P>These words all refer to estimable qualities. <B><FONT color=blue>Truthful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>veracious</FONT></B>, stemming respectively from the Old English and Latin words for true, are close synonyms that mean habitually telling or disposed to tell the truth. <I><FONT color=brown>Veracious</FONT></I> is considerably more formal and more limited in application; it is used principally of a person’s habitual tendency rather than of particular instances of truth-telling: a <I><FONT color=brown>veracious</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>truthful</FONT></I>) man; a <I><FONT color=brown>truthful</FONT></I> remark. <B><FONT color=blue>Honest</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>good</FONT></B> are, of course, rich with connotations; as here considered, <I><FONT color=brown>honest</FONT></I> means not given to lying, cheating or stealing, and stresses the virtuous and worthy motivation and principles of a person usually complimentary – since truth after all is highly valued – do not necessarily suggest an accompanying nobility of character: a <I><FONT color=brown>truthful</FONT></I> but malicious retort; He was <I><FONT color=brown>veracious</FONT></I> but unkind. <I><FONT color=brown>Honest</FONT></I> in this sense implies holding nothing back; it suggests an extreme candidness, even when at one’s own expense: an <I><FONT color=brown>honest</FONT></I> admission of his failure. <I><FONT color=brown>Good</FONT></I> may suggest honourable motives and noble character even more strongly than <I><FONT color=brown>honest</FONT></I>, but, unless placed in a limiting context, suffers from vagueness. By itself it is little more than a reflection of the high opinion of the writer: a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> reporter; a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I>, straight answer. <B><FONT color=blue>Reputable</FONT></B>, although it refers specifically to a <I><FONT color=brown>good</FONT></I> reputation, implies that the reputation is justified. <I><FONT color=brown>Reputable</FONT></I> may be used of a solid, respectable, dependable person highly regarded by the community, or it may be applied to a firm known for the consistent good quality of its goods or services: a <I><FONT color=brown>reputable</FONT></I> doctor; a <I><FONT color=brown>reputable</FONT></I> department store.

<P>All the words in this group mean to make an effort to do or accomplish something. <B><FONT color=blue>Try</FONT></B> is the most general term and, in its wider application, suggests the expenditure of physical or mental energy to get something done, but with the implication that success is likely. [She always <I><FONT color=brown>tries</FONT></I> to finish her housework before noon; <I><FONT color=brown>Try</FONT></I> to get your assignments in on time.] <I><FONT color=brown>Try</FONT></I> may imply also that one will use other means or search into other weight, have you tried to cut down on starches? In another sense <I><FONT color=brown>try</FONT></I> indicates making use of something in order to test its properties or to see if it functions properly: to <I><FONT color=brown>try</FONT></I> out a new recipe for a pudding; to <I><FONT color=brown>try</FONT></I> a window that is hard to open; to <I><FONT color=brown>try</FONT></I> driving a car with an unfamiliar type of gear-change.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Attempt</FONT></B> may serve as a more formal synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>try</FONT></I>, but in general it has its own special connotations. It sometimes puts an emphasis on beginning or embarking upon something rather than on the energy expended towards accomplishing it: The ex-convict went to another part of the country to <I><FONT color=brown>attempt</FONT></I> to lead a new and law-abiding life. This word may imply also that the desired or expected result is not always forthcoming. [The hysterical woman has several times <I><FONT color=brown>attempted</FONT></I> to kill herself in order to get attention; We have <I><FONT color=brown>attempted</FONT></I> to reach him by mail and by phone, but apparently he is out of town.] In idiomatic usage <I><FONT color=brown>attempt</FONT></I> means to try to make an attack or an assault, and it is used elliptically without the infinitive: to <I><FONT color=brown>attempt</FONT></I> (to climb) the Matterhorn; to <I><FONT color=brown>attempt</FONT></I> (to take) the life of a hated dictator.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Endeavour</FONT></B> and strive suggest the use of great exertion, especially in the face of difficulty. <I><FONT color=brown>Endeavour</FONT></I> is to try to do something requiring unusual and earnest effort: an alcoholic <I><FONT color=brown>endeavouring</FONT></I> to stop drinking. <B><FONT color=blue>Strive</FONT></B> puts the emphasis on the toil and strain involved in doing something rather than on the result achieved: <I><FONT color=brown>striving</FONT></I> to make ends meet on a small, fixed salary. Both <I><FONT color=brown>endeavour</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>strive</FONT></I> tend to sound somewhat pompous today when used arbitrarily in place of <I><FONT color=brown>try</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>attempt</FONT></I>.

<B><FONT color=blue>tryst</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>assignation</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>date</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rendezvous</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to pre-arranged meetings of an intimate nature, often secret, illicit or amorous in intent. <B><FONT color=blue>Tryst</FONT></B> is the most specific of these; it points almost invariably to a secret pre-arranged meeting, often at night, in a hidden place. The word hints at furtiveness and so strongly suggests a meeting of lovers that it could sound odd when used of any other encounter: a midnight <I><FONT color=brown>tryst</FONT></I> in the garden under a big old weeping willow. Likewise, <B><FONT color=blue>assignation</FONT></B> specifically indicates secrecy, but it also strongly suggests an illicit meeting. A <I><FONT color=brown>tryst</FONT></I> might be perfectly innocent, one that would cause no surprise or alarm if known about by others. In contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>assignation</FONT></I> denotes a meeting with an amorous or sexual purpose: arranging an <I><FONT color=brown>assignation</FONT></I> with the attractive widow while his wife was away for the weekend.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rendezvous</FONT></B> emphasizes pre-arrangement, but it may or may not be secret or unsavoury in implication. Often the word can suggest a simply matter of synchronizing independent movement so as to coincide at a planned time and place. It appears in contexts of romantic love, conspiracy and military tactics: a dimly lit café where the lovers held their <I><FONT color=brown>rendezvous</FONT></I>; the crowded bus depot where the thief and his fence made their <I><FONT color=brown>rendezvous</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>rendezvous</FONT></I> of the two patrols in Zone A at 0600 hours. <B><FONT color=blue>Date</FONT></B>, by contrast, is the most general and informal of these words and is not often likely to suggest either a secret or illicit meeting. Most commonly, the word suggests an evening of shared entertainment between a man and woman who are not married: university students who confine their <I><FONT color=brown>dates</FONT></I> to weekends. The word can apply to any sort of pre-arranged meeting at any time for any purpose: a luncheon <I><FONT color=brown>date</FONT></I> with another secretary in her office: a <I><FONT color=brown>date</FONT></I> with her hairdresser.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Meeting">MEETING</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to extreme agitation, either of external physical forces or of internal emotional states. <B><FONT color=blue>Turbulent</FONT></B>, often applied to wind and water, suggests troubled, tumbling, erratic, chaotic or confused activity or a whirl of uncontrolled emotion: <I><FONT color=brown>turbulent</FONT></I> anxieties that drove her to suicide; the <I><FONT color=brown>turbulent</FONT></I> airflow round a badly streamlined aircraft; a <I><FONT color=brown>turbulent</FONT></I> mob of jostling, jeering workers. As in the last example, the physical and emotional applications of the word may often coalesce.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Violent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wild</FONT></B> are the most general of these words. Violent stresses destructive or uncontrolled physical force: a <I><FONT color=brown>violent</FONT></I> hurricane. In reference to human action, it stresses extreme agitation and often harmful or vicious behaviour: the <I><FONT color=brown>violent</FONT></I> manner in which he pounded the podium with his fist; trying to keep the <I><FONT color=brown>turbulent</FONT></I> crowd from becoming <I><FONT color=brown>violent</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>violent</FONT></I> person capable of killing anyone who got in his way. <I><FONT color=brown>Wild</FONT></I> suggests an untamed state of nature: the Burke and Wills expedition over wild, uncharted plains and desert. Used of a person, the word can suggest uncontrolled, uncivilized behaviour: cursing and stamping about like a <I><FONT color=brown>wild</FONT></I> man. It can suggest, also, derangement or immorality: a woman who went <I><FONT color=brown>wild</FONT></I> and stabbed her three children; staggering from the lifeboat with <I><FONT color=brown>wild</FONT></I> eyes; a <I><FONT color=brown>wild</FONT></I> party.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Stormy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tempestuous</FONT></B> can refer to <I><FONT color=brown>turbulent</FONT></I> weather and also to human emotion. In either case, <I><FONT color=brown>tempestuous</FONT></I> suggests greater force or intensity: <I><FONT color=brown>stormy</FONT></I> weather that had run its course by morning; <I><FONT color=brown>tempestuous</FONT></I> barrages of wind and rain that hammered the island for three days without let-up. Used of emotions, <I><FONT color=brown>stormy</FONT></I> indicates great agitation, but there is no necessary implication of potential harm or of an unpleasant outcome: <I><FONT color=brown>stormy</FONT></I> lovers’ quarrels that end in love-making. In this context, <I><FONT color=brown>tempestuous</FONT></I> suggests forceful or disordered emotional intensity, but, like <I><FONT color=brown>stormy</FONT></I>, no necessarily harmful or lasting result: a <I><FONT color=brown>tempestuous</FONT></I>, six-month love-affair. The word can suggest the running of a range of emotions at their highest pitch; consequently, it is sometimes used in descriptions of art, particularly works from the romantic era: a <I><FONT color=brown>tempestuous</FONT></I> piano concerto. <B><FONT color=blue>Blustering</FONT></B> is related to stormy and tempestuous in that it can refer to weather, but by contrast it suggests erratic stop-and-start gusts of wind or rain. As applied to emotions, the word has a drastically different set of connotations, usually suggesting hasty, rash, angry outbursts of uncontrolled speech or action: <I><FONT color=brown>blustering</FONT></I> about the office and breaking out in fits of <I><FONT color=brown>violent</FONT></I> fury that he directed at his amazed secretary.</P><P>Both <B><FONT color=blue>riotous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tumultuous</FONT></B> can apply to turbulent or violent groups of people. In this use, <I><FONT color=brown>tumultuous</FONT></I> is like turbulent, while <I><FONT color=brown>riotous</FONT></I> is even more forceful than <I><FONT color=brown>violent</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Tumultuous</FONT></I> stresses noise, mass crowding and erratic activity, but does not necessarily suggest potential danger or destructiveness; the word can, in fact, indicate the opposite: <I><FONT color=brown>tumultuous</FONT></I> crowds that gathered to hail the astronauts; <I><FONT color=brown>tumultuous</FONT></I> applause for her performance. A <I><FONT color=brown>riotous</FONT></I> crowd, by contrast, is by implication one verging on angry mob action: an orderly meeting that became <I><FONT color=brown>riotous</FONT></I> as more and more workers cried out in favour of striking immediately. <I><FONT color=brown>Riotous</FONT></I> can refer to any sort of bewildering array or profusion: a field <I><FONT color=brown>riotous</FONT></I> with colourful flowers. It is less likely to describe emotions than <I><FONT color=brown>tumultuous</FONT></I>. In this context, the latter suggests an extreme upheaval accompanied by surges of contradictory feelings during which the rational mind cannot sort out or control the developing confusion: a <I><FONT color=brown>tumultuous</FONT></I> state of both anger and fear.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lawlessness">LAWLESSNESS</A>, <A href="entry://Unruly">UNRULY</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Tranquil">TRANQUIL</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>ugly</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>homely</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>plain</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unattractive</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>unsightly</FONT></B>:

<P>These words all refer to people or things that are aesthetically displeasing or objectionable. <B><FONT color=blue>Ugly</FONT></B> is the strongest and most unfavourable word and is broadest in application. It may refer to morally repulsive behaviour as well as to people or things that are distasteful in appearance: an <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I> hat; an <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I> tenement building; in an <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I> mood. Because of the blunt force of <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I> when applied to people, <B><FONT color=blue>homely</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>plain</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>unattractive</FONT></B>, which have softer or more diffuse impacts, are often preferred in describing someone of unpleasing appearance.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Homely</FONT></I>, influenced by its basic sense meaning familiar or everyday in character, is an Americanism which implies ugliness by reason of a common, dull or gross appearance entirely lacking in any appealing or distinguishing feature. This use sometimes applies in Australia and New Zealand, but the word usually has milder connotations of lacking beauty or needing polish and refinement: a simple, <I><FONT color=brown>homely</FONT></I> type of girl. Plain also emphasizes a lack of distinction that would lend interest or appeal. [The older sister was unfortunately rather <I><FONT color=brown>homely</FONT></I> and was never married; The girl, though <I><FONT color=brown>plain</FONT></I>, had a good, kind face.] <I><FONT color=brown>Unattractive</FONT></I> is more diffuse and vaguer than <I><FONT color=brown>plain</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>homely</FONT></I>, and may be applied to things and behaviour as well as to personal appearance: an <I><FONT color=brown>unattractive</FONT></I> habit of cracking his knuckles; a pimply, <I><FONT color=brown>unattractive</FONT></I> child; an <I><FONT color=brown>unattractive</FONT></I> neighbourhood, with run-down rooming houses and dingy shops. A person or thing considered <I><FONT color=brown>unattractive</FONT></I> is not necessarily ugly. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I> usually implies inherent form or nature, <I><FONT color=brown>unattractive</FONT></I> may refer to a superficial or temporary aspect or condition: an <I><FONT color=brown>unattractive</FONT></I> window display; He considered Byzantine architecture <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I>.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Homely</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>plain</FONT></I> usually apply specifically to facial appearance, and since women are commonly judged on the basis of personal beauty, these terms, as well as <I><FONT color=brown>unattractive</FONT></I>, are more often applied to women than men. Indeed, when a <I><FONT color=brown>man</FONT></I> is far from handsome no one hesitates to call him <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I>, because the word’s force seems masculine in strength, and few men have such a great stake in their looks that they would regard <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I> as shocking or excessive, especially when the word is applied to someone else. But to call a woman <I><FONT color=brown>ugly</FONT></I> is like calling a man pretty; it can hardly be taken as other than a deliberate insult.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unsightly</FONT></B> means offensive to the sight, and is most often used to describe an aspect rather than a person: Johnson made an unsightly appearance in his tiny, ill-fitting wig and loose black breeches; shampoos designed to rid one of <I><FONT color=brown>unsightly</FONT></I> dandruff. <I><FONT color=brown>Unsightly</FONT></I> suggests more elegant standards than the other words discussed here; it has a prim quality that implies a failure to measure up to some standard of visual decency, decorum or propriety. It does not indicate ugliness as such, but rather the visual pain of observing a breach of taste or manners: an <I><FONT color=brown>unsightly</FONT></I> stain on his tie.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Gruesome">GRUESOME</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: attractive, <A href="entry://Beautiful">BEAUTIFUL</A>.</P>

unbelief
<B><FONT color=blue>unbelief</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>disbelief</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>incredulity</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are comparable in that they each denote a chronic tendency or temporary disposition to withhold belief. <I><FONT color=brown>Unbelief</FONT></I> refers to the absence of positive belief, especially the lack of belief in God and any of the religious faiths based on a belief in God. More than the other two words in this group, it suggests a chronic mental quality rather than a particular instance of doubt: the impossibility of trying to harmonize the <I><FONT color=brown>unbelief</FONT></I> of an atheist and the conviction of a Catholic dogmatist. In theological usage, <I><FONT color=brown>unbelief</FONT></I> has condemnatory force, since it implies the wilful rejection of manifest truth.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Disbelief</FONT></B> refers to a positive conviction that a particular act, statement, doctrine, etc., is untrue, even in the face of its asserted validity. It hints at an isolated or temporary rejection instead of a continuously doubting state of mind: so committed to his point of view that he dismissed with <I><FONT color=brown>disbelief</FONT></I> all evidence of his error; A look of <I><FONT color=brown>disbelief</FONT></I> replaced the smile on his face.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>Incredulity</FONT></I> is a disinclination to accept as true whatever has been suggested as such; it is based on skepticism and a disposition to criticize or object. The word indicates a set frame of mind more than does <I><FONT color=brown>disbelief</FONT></I>, but less so than unbelief: extravagant claims for a product that were met with <I><FONT color=brown>incredulity</FONT></I> by knowledgeable buyers.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Doubt">DOUBT</A>, <A href="entry://Doubtful">DOUBTFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Sceptic">SCEPTIC</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: credulity, <A href="entry://Opinion">OPINION</A>, <A href="entry://Religion">RELIGION</A>.</P>

<P>All these words can apply to acts that go against the codes which society sets up to regulate social behaviour. <B><FONT color=blue>Unethical</FONT></B> in its generality has the widest range of uses, applying particularly to any act that barms another person: <I><FONT color=brown>unethical</FONT></I> electioneering practices such as bribery, appeals to bigotry and anonymous pamphleteering. The word has a popular connotation, as well, that suggests a milder sort of breach, one that is unfair but not so apparently harmful to someone: insisting that it was <I><FONT color=brown>unethical</FONT></I> to curry favour with an instructor. <I><FONT color=brown>Unethical</FONT></I> finds its greatest use when associated with wrongful practices in certain professions; doctors and lawyers, for example, are occasionally charged with <I><FONT color=brown>unethical</FONT></I> behaviour. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>immoral</FONT></B>, at its most general, can point to much more grave or serious harm: believing that it was <I><FONT color=brown>immoral</FONT></I> to sanction violence in the midst of social unrest. Here, <I><FONT color=brown>unethical</FONT></I> would seem a hair-splitting way of typifying the action under discussion. In popular usage, <I><FONT color=brown>immoral</FONT></I> more concretely points to sexual misbehaviour: parents so hopelessly old-fashioned and puritanical that they forbade dancing to their children as an <I><FONT color=brown>immoral</FONT></I> activity. <I><FONT color=brown>Immoral</FONT></I>, of course, can be applied like <I><FONT color=brown>unethical</FONT></I> to whatever one disapproves of: sects that view films and dancing as <I><FONT color=brown>immoral</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unscrupulous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unprincipled</FONT></B> both apply to people willing to do anything for their own gain, regardless of whom they harm. <I><FONT color=brown>Unscrupulous</FONT></I> is the less condemnatory of the two, suggesting someone who would commit any venial breach of taste, conduct or manners to advance himself, though perhaps stopping short of anything outright illegal or at least anything that would get him into trouble: an <I><FONT color=brown>unscrupulous</FONT></I> executive manager who would betray any confidence in his vain hope of ingratiating himself with the management. <I><FONT color=brown>Unprincipled</FONT></I>, by contrast, suggests an even more rapacious attitude: an <I><FONT color=brown>unprincipled</FONT></I> dope pedlar who made a fortune by ruining hundreds of lives.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Amoral</FONT></B> points to behaviour that is at variance with society’s codes of behaviour because of ignorance, indifference or a more or less principled rejection of these values: the <I><FONT color=brown>amoral</FONT></I> lives of new bohemians who see old values as nothing more than institutionalized cruelty. <B><FONT color=blue>Unmoral</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>non-moral</FONT></B> means not within the realm of morality.

<P>These words suggest a lack of participation in an activity or a lack of sympathy for it. <B><FONT color=blue>Uninvolved</FONT></B> is the most neutral in tone. It suggests an attitude of standing apart from an activity as well as from its benefits or consequences: preferring to remain <I><FONT color=brown>uninvolved</FONT></I> in the share-pushing scheme; seeking jurors <I><FONT color=brown>uninvolved</FONT></I> in the fraud case. One may have strong feelings about an activity but choose to be <I><FONT color=brown>uninvolved</FONT></I> because of fear or other pressures. <B><FONT color=blue>Unconcerned</FONT></B> stresses lack of interest or sympathy: those citizens totally <I><FONT color=brown>unconcerned</FONT></I> by the adverse trade balance. The word may even suggest carefree abandon: blithely <I><FONT color=brown>unconcerned</FONT></I> about the piling up of his debts.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indifferent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>unmoved</FONT></B> are intensifications of unconcerned, suggesting a complete lack of feeling. <I><FONT color=brown>Indifferent</FONT></I> might especially apply to an uncaring attitude about the outcome of something when faced with two or more alternatives: equally <I><FONT color=brown>indifferent</FONT></I> to every entrée on the menu. It can refer also to a lack of response to an emotional appeal: <I><FONT color=brown>indifferent</FONT></I> to his passionate advances. <I><FONT color=brown>Unmoved</FONT></I> is an intensification of this last sense of <I><FONT color=brown>indifferent</FONT></I>, referring particularly to a situation designed specifically to elicit a given reaction: a maudlin play that left me completely <I><FONT color=brown>unmoved</FONT></I>. The word suggests, too, a refusal to perform a recommended action: a pep talk on enlisting that left the men <I><FONT color=brown>unmoved</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Apathetic</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>bored</FONT></B> suggest even more resistance to arousal than <I><FONT color=brown>unmoved</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Apathetic</FONT></I> suggests a general lethargy or dullness of feeling in a person or a group: teenagers wakening from an <I><FONT color=brown>apathetic</FONT></I> acceptance of injustice and prejudice. <I><FONT color=brown>Bored</FONT></I> is more narrowly specific in meaning, suggesting an <I><FONT color=brown>unmoved</FONT></I> response to a particular event; the word does not necessarily imply the inactivity of <I><FONT color=brown>apathetic</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>bored</FONT></I> and restless children; members of the audience so <I><FONT color=brown>bored</FONT></I> by the tedious play that many left before the first-act curtain.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Aloof">ALOOF</A>, <A href="entry://Disinterested">DISINTERESTED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: concerned, engaged, interested, moved.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue>unparalleled</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>extraordinary</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>singular</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>special</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are used to describe someone or something that differs from the ordinary or the usual. That which is <B><FONT color=blue>unparalleled</FONT></B> is different in that it has no parallel or equal: it is unmatched. It suggests not so much a uniqueness of kind as an overwhelming superiority or quantity: his <I><FONT color=brown>unparalleled</FONT></I> achievements in the field of astrophysics. That which is <B><FONT color=blue>special</FONT></B> has some distinguishing or individualizing characteristic: These machines are all identical in their surface design but each one is <I><FONT color=brown>special</FONT></I> in its interior construction. Something <I><FONT color=brown>special</FONT></I> might be designed for or concerned with a specific purpose: the hospital has over fifty special diets for different kinds of illnesses. <I><FONT color=brown>Special</FONT></I> can mean peculiar or even unique: each problem that crosses my desk is <I><FONT color=brown>special</FONT></I>. It is often used to refer to the exceptional in amount or degree: a <I><FONT color=brown>special</FONT></I> fondness for French cooking. <I><FONT color=brown>Special</FONT></I> is the most comprehensive term in this group; anything described by one of the other words could certainly be called <I><FONT color=brown>special</FONT></I> as well. <B><FONT color=blue>Extraordinary</FONT></B> means greatly beyond the ordinary or usual it is a neutral word that can function in either a complimentary or a critical description: <I><FONT color=brown>extraordinary</FONT></I> kindness; <I><FONT color=brown>extraordinary</FONT></I> wickedness. Like <I><FONT color=brown>special</FONT></I>, it can be used also to refer to someone or something that is employed for a specific purpose: an envoy <I><FONT color=brown>extraordinary</FONT></I>; a mission <I><FONT color=brown>extraordinary</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Singular</FONT></B> has a wide range of meaning. In the most precise usage, it implies that whatever is being described is the only one of its type: a phenomenon <I><FONT color=brown>singular</FONT></I> in the history of this experiment. In an extension of this sense which is less limited in application, <I><FONT color=brown>singular</FONT></I> refers to the uncommon, the rare or the <I><FONT color=brown>extraordinary</FONT></I>: a woman of <I><FONT color=brown>singular</FONT></I> grace and charm. Finally, <I><FONT color=brown>singular</FONT></I> has to do with the kind of difference from the excuse her singular behaviour at the funeral.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bizarre">BIZARRE</A>, <A href="entry://Eccentricity">ECCENTRICITY</A>, <A href="entry://Queer">QUEER</A>, <A href="entry://Unusual">UNUSUAL</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://General">GENERAL</A>, <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P>

<P>These adjectives apply to persons or things that rebel against restraint or defy control. <B><FONT color=blue>Unruly</FONT></B> stresses a boisterous quality ?the tendency to burst free from restrictions or to get out of line. An <I><FONT color=brown>unruly</FONT></I> person or thing is disposed to resist discipline but can be brought under control: <I><FONT color=brown>unruly</FONT></I> boys creating a disturbance at a party; to plaster down unruly hair. <B><FONT color=blue>Wayward</FONT></B> goes beyond <I><FONT color=brown>unruly</FONT></I> in indicating wilfulness and immorality. It suggests a straying from the straight and narrow, and sometimes connotes potential delinquency or sexual promiscuity: a home for <I><FONT color=brown>wayward</FONT></I> girls. Like unruly, <I><FONT color=brown>wayward</FONT></I> may be applied to a piece of hair that will not stay in place: a <I><FONT color=brown>wayward</FONT></I> curl.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Restive</FONT></B> emphasizes impatience and irritation ?a chafing under restraint and a struggle against coercion. A <I><FONT color=brown>restive</FONT></I> horse impatiently resists control or struggles to break free. A <I><FONT color=brown>restive</FONT></I> area is not disposed to "rest" but is ready to rebel: a <I><FONT color=brown>restive</FONT></I> campus, ripe for a student riot. By extension, <I><FONT color=brown>restive</FONT></I> has come to mean restless or fidgety, discontented with the status quo: an inattentive, <I><FONT color=brown>restive</FONT></I> audience, impatiently waiting for the interval.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Intractable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>refractory</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>recalcitrant</FONT></B> are more formal words that indicate an obstinate refusal to yield. An <I><FONT color=brown>intractable</FONT></I> person or animal stubbornly resists all efforts to lead, guide, restrain or influence him: The boy was shy and quiet, yet strong-willed, independent and <I><FONT color=brown>intractable</FONT></I> ?as stubborn as a mule. Applied to things, <I><FONT color=brown>intractable</FONT></I> means difficult to manipulate, treat or word: The source material was <I><FONT color=brown>intractable</FONT></I> and there was little the librettist could do with it. <I><FONT color=brown>Refractory</FONT></I> implies more active resistance, suggesting a positive rather than a passive disobedience. <I><FONT color=brown>Refractory</FONT></I> persons are both obstinate and rebellious, determined to protest against the dictates of authority: a <I><FONT color=brown>refractory</FONT></I> child, doing just the opposite of what he is told. A <I><FONT color=brown>refractory</FONT></I> metal or ore is one that resists heat or ordinary methods of reduction. [Fire clay is a <I><FONT color=brown>refractory</FONT></I> material used to make crucibles and furnace linings; it resists the highest temperatures of the blast furnace without melting.] <I><FONT color=brown>Recalcitrant</FONT></I> comes from Latin roots meaning to kick back. It is close in meaning to <I><FONT color=brown>refractory</FONT></I> but more extreme, implying uncompromising resistance or a disposition to be defiant: A <I><FONT color=brown>recalcitrant</FONT></I> student who not only refused to obey the rules but threatened a teacher with violence.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unmanageable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ungovernable</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>uncontrollable</FONT></B> apply to things that are hard to handle or impossible to control. An <I><FONT color=brown>unmanageable</FONT></I> person or animal will not submit to guidance or direction. An <I><FONT color=brown>unmanageable</FONT></I> thing is incapable of being handled or dealt with successfully: a large but not <I><FONT color=brown>unmanageable</FONT></I> amount of work. That which is <I><FONT color=brown>ungovernable</FONT></I> cannot be regulated by rules or agreed-upon restraints; it defies any attempt to tame it or to bring it under orderly, rational control: an <I><FONT color=brown>ungovernable</FONT></I> land, beset with warring factions and internal strife. <I><FONT color=brown>Ungovernable</FONT></I> often suggests a loss or lack of self-control: an <I><FONT color=brown>ungovernable</FONT></I> temper. <I><FONT color=brown>Uncontrollable</FONT></I> is the most extreme of these words. It applies to that which goes beyond the bounds of control, as by being involuntary, instinctive, irrepressible or wild: <I><FONT color=brown>uncontrollable</FONT></I> muscular spasms; <I><FONT color=brown>uncontrollable</FONT></I> anger. In a special reference to children, <I><FONT color=brown>uncontrollable</FONT></I> means that the parents are unable to control or be socially responsible for them.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Loud">LOUD</A>, <A href="entry://Mischievous">MISCHIEVOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Stubborn">STUBBORN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Adaptable">ADAPTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Compliant">COMPLIANT</A>, <A href="entry://Docile">DOCILE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to an uneasy or exasperated response to external factors or causes. <B><FONT color=blue>Unsettle</FONT></B> is the least intense of these, suggesting someone who has been unnerved or vaguely disquieted by something; the cause may be a specific distraction or a more indefinable mood or atmosphere: <I><FONT color=brown>unsettled</FONT></I> by the constant wailing of an infant in the next flat; <I><FONT color=brown>unsettled</FONT></I> by the cold formality of the office. Even in the active voice, the word does not suggest an intentional attempt to unnerve someone so much as a subjective or intuitive response to an existing state of affairs. One would not be likely to say: He deliberately <I><FONT color=brown>unsettled</FONT></I> me. But one could say: Oddly enough, his presence in the room <I><FONT color=brown>unsettled</FONT></I> me. By contrast, <B><FONT color=blue>annoy</FONT></B> can indicate both an intentional disturbance and a disturbed response. [Why do you insist on <I><FONT color=brown>annoying</FONT></I> her?; I was <I><FONT color=brown>annoyed</FONT></I> by the way he kept mumbling something over and over to himself.] In any case, <I><FONT color=brown>annoy</FONT></I> indicates a greater degree of emotional upset than does <I><FONT color=brown>unsettle</FONT></I>: His whistling <I><FONT color=brown>unsettles</FONT></I> me a bit, but it doesn’t really <I><FONT color=brown>annoy</FONT></I> me all that much.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Irritate</FONT></B> suggests a repeated, abrasive action that annoys a person by draining him of patience or good humour; nothing is too trivial to <I><FONT color=brown>irritate</FONT></I>, if the temper of the observer is highly strung or petulant: Her habit of tapping her fingers on the chair while she read the newspaper <I><FONT color=brown>irritated</FONT></I> him. <B><FONT color=blue>Nettle</FONT></B> suggests being temporarily aroused to anger or pique, often because of something considered damaging to one’s self-respect: <I><FONT color=brown>nettled</FONT></I> by her wilful disregard of his advice; <I><FONT color=brown>nettled</FONT></I> by the critic’s casual rejection of his arguments. <I><FONT color=brown>Nettle</FONT></I> often implies, as in these examples, a sense of indignation occasioned by a real or fancied slight.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rile</FONT></B> is in every way an intensification of <I><FONT color=brown>annoy</FONT></I>, but it is also more informal; the word emphasizes response without suggesting an intended cause: <I><FONT color=brown>riled</FONT></I> by his unthinking rudeness; I didn’t mean to get you all <I><FONT color=brown>riled</FONT></I> up over nothing. <B><FONT color=blue>Put out</FONT></B> is related more closely to unsettle than to the previous pair. It points to the vague dissatisfaction of someone who has been displeased, inconvenienced or disappointed. [He was <I><FONT color=brown>put out</FONT></I> by the way everyone at the party ignored him; She tried to get her word done but was terribly <I><FONT color=brown>put out</FONT></I> by the constant interruptions of the workmen; Only a sullen silence suggested how <I><FONT color=brown>put out</FONT></I> he was over not getting his promotion.] As in the last example, the word can imply a minimal, passive or withdrawn response; this may be true for <I><FONT color=brown>unsettled</FONT></I> also. By contrast, <I><FONT color=brown>annoy</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>irritate</FONT></I> suggest a more agitated or noticeable response. In the active voice, put out refers more exclusively to inconvenience: I hope we haven’t <I><FONT color=brown>put</FONT></I> you<I><FONT color=brown> out</FONT></I> by staying so late.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: ANGER (v.) <A href="entry://Bother">BOTHER</A>, <A href="entry://Incite">INCITE</A>, <A href="entry://Outrage">OUTRAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Upset">UPSET</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: calm, relax, relieve, soothe, tranquillize.</P>

<P>That which is <B><FONT color=blue>unusual</FONT></B> is something that varies from the ordinary, the expected or the commonplace: It was an <I><FONT color=brown>unusual</FONT></I> day for summer, damp and chilly, with a biting wind more reminiscent of August than January. <I><FONT color=brown>Unusual</FONT></I> is a neutral word; it can be used to describe something thought of as good or something thought of as bad: a gift expressing her <I><FONT color=brown>unusual</FONT></I> generosity; an act that showed <I><FONT color=brown>unusual</FONT></I> malice. <B><FONT color=blue>Exceptional</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>unusual</FONT></I>, describes something that departs from the usual; it, too, can function in either a complimentary or a critical description. [He treated his employees with <I><FONT color=brown>exceptional</FONT></I> kindness; She showed an <I><FONT color=brown>exceptional</FONT></I> disregard for detail in her work.] <I><FONT color=brown>Exceptional</FONT></I> may suggest excellence or superiority in a way that <I><FONT color=brown>unusual</FONT></I> cannot. If one speaks of a singer’s <I><FONT color=brown>unusual</FONT></I> voice, there is no implicit indication of quality. But a reference to a singer’s <I><FONT color=brown>exceptional</FONT></I> voice would almost certainly be a compliment. <I><FONT color=brown>Exceptional</FONT></I> is applied also to children who are mentally or physically gifted, as well as to those who are retarded to the extent that they require special education and psychological aid.</P><P>One says of a thing that it is <B><FONT color=blue>rare</FONT></B> when one wishes to describe it as something that is found or occurs but seldom, whether or not it was once common: <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> moments of quiet in the midst of a loud debate; a <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> out-of-print book which is the only one remaining out of thousands that were printed. That which is <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> may be ordinary, but it is usually <I><FONT color=brown>exceptional</FONT></I>, and the word can be employed to identify something that is for superlative or excellent: a gem of <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> beauty and worth; a <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> ability for handling personnel problems. While something that is <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I> is infrequent of its kind, something that is <B><FONT color=blue>unique</FONT></B> is alone of its kind. [Great poems are <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I>; "Paradise Lost" is <I><FONT color=brown>unique</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Unique</FONT></I> was once limited in definition to this sense, but usage has extended its meaning to unusual or <I><FONT color=brown>rare</FONT></I>, often preceded by a qualifier: a <I><FONT color=brown>unique</FONT></I> opportunity; a rather <I><FONT color=brown>unique</FONT></I> situation.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Off-beat</FONT></B> is slang and means differing from the usual. It implies a departure from the familiar, the orthodox or the conventional, and so it departure from the familiar, the orthodox or the conventional, and so it is often used to describe something of which the speaker or writer is critical: a really bad novel, full of violence and <I><FONT color=brown>off-beat</FONT></I> sex. Nevertheless, since the <I><FONT color=brown>unusual</FONT></I>, the unorthodox and the unconventional are often the forerunners of popular fashions and trends, <I><FONT color=brown>off-beat</FONT></I> may be complimentary in tone in some contexts: Her boutique specializes in <I><FONT color=brown>off-beat</FONT></I> clothes and has become one of the most talked-about fashion spots in town.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Occasional">OCCASIONAL</A>, <A href="entry://Unparalleled">UNPARALLELED</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: established, <A href="entry://General">GENERAL</A>, <A href="entry://Invariable">INVARIABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Usual">USUAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words indicate the refusal to assent to something or a cautious, grudging or indecisive attitude towards it. <B><FONT color=blue>Unwilling</FONT></B> points to a flat rejection and is the most forcefully negative of these words: <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I> to lend him the money and <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I> even to discuss it. Also, the word can indicate someone involved in something contrary to his wishes: the Ancient Mariner’s <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I> listener. <B><FONT color=blue>Loath</FONT></B> (or as it is also spelt, <I><FONT color=brown>loth</FONT></I>) can be taken as having negative force equal to or surpassing that of <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I>; this may stem from overtones supplied by its near relative. <I><FONT color=brown>Loathe</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>loath</FONT></I> to do anything detrimental to her reputation. In common use, the word can suggest resistance to or distaste for something, without implying the adamant refusal inherent in <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>loath</FONT></I> to go to the opera, but doing so to please his wife. This is especially true where on feels compelled to do something whether one likes it or not: <I><FONT color=brown>loath</FONT></I> to acquit the man, though the lack of conclusive evidence left the magistrate no other choice. To illustrate the contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I>, it can be said that most young men are probably loath to enter compulsory national service, but only pacifists are <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I> to be called up. On the other hand, one might not be loath to do something and yet remain <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I>: keenly interested in the assignment but <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I> to do it for so little money.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Averse</FONT></B> suggests distaste, that may be innate but that is usually so strong as to be unalterable; this deep-seated distaste, may or may not result in an <I><FONT color=brown>unwilling</FONT></I> response: so <I><FONT color=brown>averse</FONT></I> to crowds that he habitually went to any lengths to avoid them; <I><FONT color=brown>averse</FONT></I> to the idea of his wife’s working, but agree to it because of their desperate financial situation. <B><FONT color=blue>Reluctant</FONT></B> may sometimes suggest firm resistance to something: insisting that he was, and would remain, <I><FONT color=brown>reluctant</FONT></I> to vote for any bill liberalizing the divorce laws. More often the word indicates a grudging or provisional consent: finally giving his <I><FONT color=brown>reluctant</FONT></I> permission to test the drug on human beings, but only under a programme of strict control. <B><FONT color=blue>Disinclined</FONT></B> is similar to loath and even more so to averse in suggesting distaste for something. It suggests a weaker resistance than these words, and may point to a cautious or prudent attitude that is habitual or is based on past experience or present evidence: <I><FONT color=brown>disinclined</FONT></I> to decide on an all-out attack on the enemy. <I><FONT color=brown>Disinclined</FONT></I> is alone in this set of words in applying to opinions, views or judgements as well as to consent or action: <I><FONT color=brown>disinclined</FONT></I> to believe the man’s story; <I><FONT color=brown>disinclined</FONT></I> to take the reports of flying saucers very seriously. Sometimes the word is used as a circumlocution for a more direct word of disapproval. <B><FONT color=blue>Hesitant</FONT></B> suggests the least resistance of any of these words. It can, in fact, refer merely to indecisiveness or immobilizing cautiousness: so many confusing alternatives that he was <I><FONT color=brown>hesitant</FONT></I> to commit himself to any one choice of action.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Opposed">OPPOSED</A>, <A href="entry://Stubborn">STUBBORN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Favourable">FAVOURABLE</A>, inclined, <A href="entry://Ready">READY</A>, <A href="entry://Wilful">WILFUL</A>.</P>

unwise
<B><FONT color=blue>unwise</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ill-advised</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>imprudent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>inadvisable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>injudicious</FONT></B>:

<P>These adjectives are low-keyed, unemotional words used to call the wisdom of actions or decisions into question without giving offence. All are politely or mildly critical, emphasizing the absence of a positive attribute rather than the presence of a negative one. All may be used either to express disapproval or to convey a word of warning. <B><FONT color=blue>Unwise</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>inadvisable</FONT></B> are the most general words and may serve as less precise substitutes for the others. When used in expressing an opinion on something already done, they imply a preferable alternative that would have been considered wiser: an <I><FONT color=brown>unwise</FONT></I> choice; This course of action seems <I><FONT color=brown>inadvisable</FONT></I> to me. If anything, <I><FONT color=brown>unwise</FONT></I> is the stronger because, when used as an advisory or precautionary word, it may sometimes imply considerable risk and possible danger: To make speculative investments without adequate saving is unwise. <B><FONT color=blue>Injudicious</FONT></B> is milder than both, suggesting not so much a lack of basic good judgement as a failure to exercise the best possible judgement in a certain sensitive situation. Where <I><FONT color=brown>unwise</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>inadvisable</FONT></I> may refer to something foolish or risky, what is <I><FONT color=brown>injudicious</FONT></I> is simply ill-considered or indiscreet. [The official made some hasty, <I><FONT color=brown>injudicious</FONT></I> remarks; Her <I><FONT color=brown>injudicious</FONT></I> eagerness to buy the antique encouraged the dealer to raise the price. <I><FONT color=brown>Unwise</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>inadvisable</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>injudicious</FONT></I> and <B><FONT color=blue>imprudent</FONT></B> all point to a lack of foresight, a failure to think ahead and anticipate consequences. But imprudent emphasizes a lack of discretion, implying that greater precautions might be taken or that greater circumspection might be shown. [The doctor thought it imprudent for his patient to take a long trip; The teacher’s colleagues felt that it was imprudent of him to over-praise his student.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ill-advised</FONT></B> is perhaps the least offensive of these inoffensive terms. It tends to shift responsibility or blame from the person himself to his actual or supposed advisers. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>unwise</FONT></I> might imply a personal failure in judgement, <I><FONT color=brown>ill-advised</FONT></I> and to some extent <I><FONT color=brown>inadvisable</FONT></I> suggest that a person was acting or that a project was undertaken in accordance with bad or inadequate advice. [You were <I><FONT color=brown>ill-advised</FONT></I> to sell the shares, since they have good growth potential; an <I><FONT color=brown>ill-advised</FONT></I> strike that forced their employer to go out of business.] <I><FONT color=brown>Ill-advised</FONT></I> may be used also to warn someone against taking action without getting enough sound advice beforehand: It would be <I><FONT color=brown>ill-advised</FONT></I> to abandon the project before all the preliminary reports are in.</P><P>SE: <A href="entry://Absurd">ABSURD</A>, <A href="entry://Heedless">HEEDLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Reckless">RECKLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Stupid">STUPID</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Careful">CAREFUL</A>, <A href="entry://Cautious">CAUTIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Considerate">CONSIDERATE</A>, judicious, provident, <A href="entry://Sensible">SENSIBLE</A>.</P>

<P>These words are concerned with protection or assistance given in the face of difficulty or hostility. <B><FONT color=blue>Uphold</FONT></B> specifically suggests an active attempt to prevent something from giving way or from falling into dander or neglect: an innate pride that <I><FONT color=brown>upheld</FONT></I> her during the worst of the crisis; <I><FONT color=brown>upholding</FONT></I> the school’s tradition of good sportsmanship. <B><FONT color=blue>Back</FONT></B> (or <I><FONT color=brown>back up</FONT></I>) can also apply to the protection of principles or ideas, but it is very often used in a more personal way, suggesting that one person stands behind or subscribes to the efforts of another who has exposed himself to danger or disapproval. The word can therefore suggest a more passive role than upho<I><FONT color=brown>l</FONT></I>d: careless of the risk in <I><FONT color=brown>upholding</FONT></I> the cause because he was confident that others in the community would silently <I><FONT color=brown>back</FONT></I> him<I><FONT color=brown> up</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Back</FONT></I> may also specifically suggest the choosing of sides in a contest: voters who had <I><FONT color=brown>backed</FONT></I> the less popular candidate. <I><FONT color=brown>Back</FONT></I> has also a special sense of making a financial investment on some favoured animal in a race: I <I><FONT color=brown>backed</FONT></I> four winners at Randwick on Saturday.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Defend</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>champion</FONT></B> suggest action in the face of hostility. <I><FONT color=brown>Defend</FONT></I> is more restricted in scope than champion, stressing the protection of a challenged right or position. The extent of the action taken, however, may be slight or great: <I><FONT color=brown>defending</FONT></I> her reputation with a well-placed word or two; <I><FONT color=brown>defending</FONT></I> his friends from injury by throwing himself on the falling grenade. <I><FONT color=brown>Champion</FONT></I> specifically stresses a more active, offensive role and may suggest taking the place of someone less able to act. It may suggest also a single-handed offence, as opposed to most of these other words which imply that many could conceivably co-operate in protection or assistance: the only newspaper that insistently <I><FONT color=brown>championed</FONT></I> the right of teenagers to have their say.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Support</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sustain</FONT></B> are like <I><FONT color=brown>back</FONT></I> in suggesting the assistance of something that is in an exposed or endangered position. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>back</FONT></I> suggests more determination than either of these words in themselves, <I><FONT color=brown>support</FONT></I> states the mere fact of aid or favour, without any implications of resoluteness or permanent commitment: <I><FONT color=brown>supporting</FONT></I> the candidate in the pre-selection ballot but not in the election campaign. Unlike back and support, sustain cannot apply to the choosing of sides in a contest. It can go beyond support in other situations to suggest a continuing loyalty: sustaining his interest in their plight over more than a decade. In another use, it can suggest the granting of a point or the giving of peripheral aid, without taking sides on larger issues: asking the judge to sustain his objection concerning the tactics of his opponent; friends who helped to sustain his morale during exam week by popping in often with coffee and sandwiches.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Maintain</FONT></B> may suggest resoluteness in the context of advocacy: maintaining that he boy’s confession had been coerced. In other situations, it may suggest continuing support that may be minimal or less than adequate: The absent father <I><FONT color=brown>maintained</FONT></I> the payments over many years, but they were never enough to <I><FONT color=brown>sustain</FONT></I> the whole family.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Encourage">ENCOURAGE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: betray, <A href="entry://Destroy">DESTROY</A>, drop.</P>

<P>These words all denote some kind of effort to defy or overthrow a government or other form of authority. <B><FONT color=blue>Uprising</FONT></B> is the broadest term and may be substituted in a general way for any of the other words. Specifically it may refer to a minor or unsuccessful act of popular resistance: a historic <I><FONT color=brown>uprising</FONT></I> of the slaves on a Jamaican Plantation. It can apply also to those localized signs of unrest and discontent indicating the imminence of widespread conflict: the first short-lived <I><FONT color=brown>uprisings</FONT></I> in Germany and Austria that led to the Peasant’s War of 1524-1526. <B><FONT color=blue>Rebellion</FONT></B> is an armed resistance or <I><FONT color=brown>uprising</FONT></I> against a government, often on a large scale and frequently doomed to failure. If successful, a <I><FONT color=brown>rebellion</FONT></I> may become a full-scale <B><FONT color=blue>revolution</FONT></B>, which involves the overthrow and replacement of a government or a political system by those who are governed. In a wider sense, <I><FONT color=brown>revolution</FONT></I> can denote any extensive or drastic change in economic institutions, in ideas or in mores: the Industrial <I><FONT color=brown>Revolution</FONT></I> that began in England in the mid-18<SUP>th</SUP> century; the <I><FONT color=brown>revolution</FONT></I> in manners and morals that followed World War II.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Insurrection</FONT></B> point to an organized effort to seize power, especially political power, while <B><FONT color=blue>revolt</FONT></B> emphasizes protest against oppression or other intolerable conditions. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>insurrection</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>revolt</FONT></I> has the extended meaning of any refusal to go on tolerating an allegiance or a powerful authority: a <I><FONT color=brown>revolt</FONT></I> within an established church.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Insurgency</FONT></B> has almost the same meaning as <I><FONT color=brown>insurrection</FONT></I>, but it usually designates a better-organized kind of <I><FONT color=brown>revolt</FONT></I>, and is often used today to refer to <I><FONT color=brown>revolutionary</FONT></I> activity that is aided by foreign powers. <B><FONT color=blue>Counter-insurgency</FONT></B>, a word most common in news and propaganda media, is any measure designed to combat revolutionary activity or guerrilla warfare.</P><P>If an <I><FONT color=brown>uprising</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>insurrection</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>insurgency</FONT></I> continues for a long period of time without being effectively countered, the country of its origin may be said to be in a state of <B><FONT color=blue>civil war</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Civil war</FONT></I> is armed conflict openly carried on between parties or sections of the same country, whether or not both parties involved are legally recognized as belligerents. In the usual sense of the term, <I><FONT color=brown>civil war</FONT></I> involves factions (generally two) each of which is trying to gain control of the existing central government. In this way, a <I><FONT color=brown>civil war</FONT></I> differs from a revolution in that the emphasis is not on overthrowing a régime. The American <I><FONT color=brown>Civil War</FONT></I> differed from the above concept in that the South seceded and wished to become a separate nation.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conspiracy">CONSPIRACY</A>, <A href="entry://Crime">CRIME</A>, <A href="entry://Intrigue">INTRIGUE</A>, <A href="entry://Lawlessness">LAWLESSNESS</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to acts that cause or result in emotional upheaval. <B><FONT color=blue>Upset</FONT></B> is the most general and the least formal, stressing a complete or sudden loss of mental equilibrium, although this may or may not be accompanied by an outward show: finally admitting that she was deeply <I><FONT color=brown>upset</FONT></I>; ridicule deliberately designed to <I><FONT color=brown>upset</FONT></I> him. Usually the word suggests a temporary state of mind from which one can normally recover in time: <I><FONT color=brown>upset</FONT></I> all morning until her usual sense of calm returned. Although <I><FONT color=brown>upset</FONT></I> can imply a more permanent derangement, <B><FONT color=blue>disturb</FONT></B> is now more frequently used in this sense: juvenile delinquents who are emotionally <I><FONT color=brown>disturbed</FONT></I>. In this case, <I><FONT color=brown>disturb</FONT></I> suggests a mental disorder that may verge on psychosis. When the word refers to a momentary upheaval, it suggests a milder anguish than <I><FONT color=brown>upset</FONT></I> and possibly one more gradual in onset. It might imply also a deepening uneasiness difficult to define: She was growing more and more <I><FONT color=brown>disturbed</FONT></I> that he had neither arrived nor phoned to explain the delay. <B><FONT color=blue>Agitate</FONT></B> is more like <I><FONT color=brown>upset</FONT></I> in suggesting a sudden upheaval, but it contrasts with the latter in specifically suggesting an unavoidable outward show of one’s turbulent state of mind: so <I><FONT color=brown>agitated</FONT></I> that he stalked about the room muttering incoherently to himself. On the other hand, the turbulence may be the intensified expression of a chronic nervousness rather than the result of deep emotional shock.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Demoralize</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>disconcert</FONT></B> indicate a less intense upheaval than the foregoing words, suggesting that something has reduced one to a state of complete ineffectiveness. Of the two, <I><FONT color=brown>disconcert</FONT></I> more nearly resembles <I><FONT color=brown>upset</FONT></I> in implying a sudden onset accompanied by on necessary outward show, but resulting momentarily in mental disarray and confusion. By contrast, it most often suggests an upheaval that results from some specific confrontation: <I><FONT color=brown>disconcerted</FONT></I> by the salesgirl’s pointed remarks about her taste. Although <I><FONT color=brown>demoralize</FONT></I> may indicate the slightest emotional upheaval of all these words, it nevertheless suggests a gradual and long-term exhaustion or sapping of the will because of a hopelessly snarled inefficiency and wasted effort that had thoroughly <I><FONT color=brown>demoralized</FONT></I> the whole staff; <I><FONT color=brown>demoralized</FONT></I> and embittered by the sergeant-major’s constant harassment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Exacerbate</FONT></B> refers to the worsening of anger, irritability, pain, etc. in this context, it can function as an intensification of any of these other words: first <I><FONT color=brown>upsetting</FONT></I> her with the news that he was leaving her and then <I><FONT color=brown>exacerbating</FONT></I> the hurt by proceeding to call her names. <I><FONT color=brown>Exacerbate</FONT></I> may also mean simply to exasperate or irritate, but this usage tends to sound informal.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Complain">COMPLAIN</A>, <A href="entry://Confuse">CONFUSE</A>, <A href="entry://Hurt">DISTRESS</A>, <A href="entry://Embarrassment">EMBARRASSMENT</A>, <A href="entry://Enrage">ENRAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Frenzy">FRENZY</A>, <A href="entry://Outrage">OUTRAGE</A>, <A href="entry://Puzzle">PUZZLE</A>, <A href="entry://Shame">SHAME</A>, <A href="entry://Surprised">SURPRISED</A>, <A href="entry://Unsettle">UNSETTLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: calm, relax, relieve, soothe.</P>

<P>These words are alike in applying to conditions, events or things of the present time. <B><FONT color=blue>Up-to-date</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>with it</FONT></B> usually mean keeping abreast of recent developments or accurately reflecting the modern world: an <I><FONT color=brown>up-to-date</FONT></I> encyclopaedia, revised thoroughly every year. They can mean being in step with contemporary life, and in this sense are the opposite of old-fashioned: Get <I><FONT color=brown>with it</FONT></I>, be <I><FONT color=brown>up-to-date</FONT></I>, smoke Whacko for that cool taste. But note that <I><FONT color=brown>up-to-date</FONT></I> does not necessarily mean fashionable in the sense of stylish: Though the woman’s suit was hardly a Paris original, it was well-tailored and <I><FONT color=brown>up-to-date</FONT></I>. With it is the more informal of the two terms and is used with less generality: You may be <I><FONT color=brown>with it</FONT></I> in your choice of ties but that doesn’t make you an <I><FONT color=brown>up-to-date</FONT></I> dresser.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fresh</FONT></B> emphasizes originality and the absence of prejudice or preconceived notions: The Prime Minister convened a committee of senior members of the Department of External Affairs to take a <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I> look at our policy in South-East Asia. A <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I> look may result in the confirmation of old policies: it is nevertheless <B><FONT color=blue>new</FONT></B>, in the sense that the old assumptions and reason have been critically re-examined from a disinterested point of view.</P><I><FONT color=brown><P>New</FONT></I> is the broadest term of this group. It may mean keeping up with the times, being contemporary, and in this sense it is synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>up-to-date</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>new</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>up-to-date</FONT></I>) method of testing to determine vocational aptitudes. Perhaps its most common meaning refers to being recent or original; here it is applied to something just invented, created or developed: a <I><FONT color=brown>new</FONT></I> tin opener, based upon an entirely different mechanical principle; a <I><FONT color=brown>new</FONT></I> book, just published. In this sense the phrase "<I><FONT color=brown>brand new</FONT></I>" is sometimes used to emphasize the recentness of the action referred to, e.g., a brand <I><FONT color=brown>new</FONT></I> pair of shoes refers to a pair of shoes which has just been bought. <I><FONT color=brown>New</FONT></I> is used also as a synonym for fresh in the sense of unprejudiced: a <I><FONT color=brown>new</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>fresh</FONT></I>) approach to the problem of Aboriginal housing and education.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Novel</FONT></B> is close to new but stresses the ingenuity and difference that characterize new things. A <I><FONT color=brown>new</FONT></I> idea may be original, but a <I><FONT color=brown>novel</FONT></I> idea is sparkling and ingenious. <I><FONT color=brown>Novel</FONT></I> suggests more originality and creativity than any of the other words here considered, and it is therefore sometimes used with a degree of mistrust or with a suggestion of impracticability. [It was a <I><FONT color=brown>novel</FONT></I> arrangement, but it just didn’t work; She bought a <I><FONT color=brown>novel</FONT></I> device for slicing onions.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Modernistic</FONT></B> means tending to be modern or giving the appearance of being modern in style, as in furniture, architecture or art. It may be used neutrally, but frequently connotes superficiality and sometimes cheapness: a <I><FONT color=brown>modernistic</FONT></I> painting that demonstrates no real understanding of contemporary art. In connotation the word is close to with it; it often suggests the deliberate intention to be modern rather than the simple fact of being modern.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Modern">MODERN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Ancient">ANCIENT</A>, <A href="entry://Old">OLD</A>, OLD-FASHIONED, timeworn.</P>

<P>These words all deal with qualities of mind or manner characteristic of well-bred, worldly wise or educated people. Virtually every one of the words here discussed is sometimes used in a derogatory, disapproving or humorously condescending way.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Urbane</FONT></B> means having a refined or polished manner, such as befits one who is well travelled, will-bred or long accustomed to the society of cultivated people; an <I><FONT color=brown>urbane</FONT></I> conversation about Continental cooking. <B><FONT color=blue>Cultivated</FONT></B> indicates a sophistication acquired through formal education or purposeful experience: a <I><FONT color=brown>cultivated</FONT></I> appreciation of abstract art. <I><FONT color=brown>Cultivated</FONT></I> speech is educated speech, as distinguished from the speech of the ignorant, untutored or illiterate. When applied to people, <I><FONT color=brown>cultivated</FONT></I> often stresses knowledge and the appreciation of the arts, whereas <B><FONT color=blue>sophisticated</FONT></B> can suggest superficiality, indicating over-polished manners and sometimes a sceptical or jaded attitude towards life: Too <I><FONT color=brown>sophisticated</FONT></I> for plain fare, she frowned in disgust at the simple food humbly placed before her. <I><FONT color=brown>Cultivated</FONT></I> can also be used derogatorily to mean contrived or affected: a carefully <I><FONT color=brown>cultivated</FONT></I> Southern English accent designed to impress her fiends.</P><P>When <I><FONT color=brown>sophisticated</FONT></I> is positive in tone, it points to advanced perception and an appreciation of culture that comes with study or experience; in such contexts even the toughness or worldly wise quality the word connotes may be viewed with admiration: Although the play was considered strong stuff by out-of-town audiences, the <I><FONT color=brown>sophisticated</FONT></I> city playgoers, found it weak tea, and the show closed in three weeks. When applied to things, <I><FONT color=brown>sophisticated</FONT></I> often means using advanced and complicated technological techniques: a very <I><FONT color=brown>sophisticated</FONT></I> antip-missile missile defence system. In its association with scientific achievement, the word acquires a wholly positive character; there are few things more highly valued in 20<SUP>th</SUP>-century society than modern technology.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Genteel</FONT></B> conveys derogatory or humorously condescending connotations in most uses today. <I><FONT color=brown>Genteel</FONT></I> formerly meant simply well-bred or refined, but nowadays it usually means too consciously <I><FONT color=brown>cultivated</FONT></I>. To call a person or his manners <I><FONT color=brown>genteel</FONT></I> implies that he is defensive and unsure of his own social background or status, and therefore so anxious to prove himself <I><FONT color=brown>cultivated</FONT></I> that he succeeds only in making himself pretentious or ridiculous: Her <I><FONT color=brown>genteel</FONT></I> manners made it impossible for her to grasp a coffee cup without elevating two fingers, even though the coffee frequently sloshed on to the floor as a result. Buildings are sometimes described as being "shabby <I><FONT color=brown>genteel</FONT></I>," indicating a ludicrous incongruity between the once splendid décor and its present, poorly maintained condition or old-fashioned style. The personification suggests someone who has seen better days and is now trying with only moderate success to appear respectable.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Suave</FONT></B> means smoothly pleasant or ingratiating; it may be purely descriptive and quite neutral in tone, and in this sense is close to <I><FONT color=brown>urbane</FONT></I> in meaning: a <I><FONT color=brown>suave</FONT></I> and masterfully executed bow. But it may be associated with a surface politeness, an oily manner and glibness in speech: At first she found him attractive and <I><FONT color=brown>suave</FONT></I>, but the soon recognized his falseness and basic vulgarity.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Blithe">BLITHE</A>, <A href="entry://Exquisite">EXQUISITE</A>, <A href="entry://Gregarious">GREGARIOUS</A>, <A href="entry://Polite">POLITE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Brusque">BRUSQUE</A>, <A href="entry://Gauche">GAUCHE</A>, NAÏVE, <A href="entry://Vulgar">VULGAR</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to putting something to work, with or without altering it in the process. <B><FONT color=blue>Use</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of these, and there is no context within which it would not be suitable for expressing this activity, whether or not the object involved is altered in the process: <I><FONT color=brown>using</FONT></I> a dictionary to check his spelling; <I><FONT color=brown>using</FONT></I> about ten gallons of petrol a week. When the word is applied to a person, a strong note of disapproval for the act is evident: the egotist who <I><FONT color=brown>uses</FONT></I> other people as if they were doormats. When use occurs with the preposition "up," the word refers to the total depletion of the thing in question and often suggests waste or extravagance: <I><FONT color=brown>using up</FONT></I> the last of his water supply; <I><FONT color=brown>using up</FONT></I> his gifts in a brief burst of youthful profligacy.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Consume</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>expend</FONT></B> emphasize the alteration or depletion of the thing used. At their most concrete, the words contrast sharply in that <I><FONT color=brown>consume</FONT></I> refers to the taking in of something, as in eating, and <I><FONT color=brown>expend</FONT></I> refers to the paying out of something: asking how many bushels of fodder his herd consumed in a day; <I><FONT color=brown>expending</FONT></I> no more than a quarter of your earnings in rent. <I><FONT color=brown>Consume</FONT></I> particularly emphasizes the total depletion or destruction of something: the number of trees <I><FONT color=brown>consumed</FONT></I> to make the newsprint in one edition of your newspaper. But destruction need not be the word’s main point: the energy <I><FONT color=brown>consumed</FONT></I> in debating the project. Related uses cast light on the word’s connotation in this context: ravenously <I><FONT color=brown>consuming</FONT></I> a full four-course dinner; a building <I><FONT color=brown>consumed</FONT></I> by fire; <I><FONT color=brown>consumed</FONT></I> with envy. None of these connotations of haste, waste or destruction is present in one of the most popular meanings of the word, referring in business or economic parlance to the purchase or turnover (and presumably <I><FONT color=brown>use</FONT></I>) of goods: a more sophisticated public that <I><FONT color=brown>consumes</FONT></I> an ever greater variety of products. Beyond its references to depletion or the paying out of money, <I><FONT color=brown>expend</FONT></I> can point, like <I><FONT color=brown>consume</FONT></I>, to the using of non-material things: <I><FONT color=brown>expending</FONT></I> a good deal of effort on the term paper. In the parlance of military supply, it functions exactly like <I><FONT color=brown>consume</FONT></I> in its business sense, but in this case the word suggests the actual <I><FONT color=brown>using up</FONT></I>, wearing out or destruction of perishable military goods: not required to account for toilet gear and other items that are considered <I><FONT color=brown>expended</FONT></I> upon issue; <I><FONT color=brown>expended</FONT></I> rounds of ammunition.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Employ</FONT></B> has a legitimate use to refer to the using of hired workers of any kind: a company that <I><FONT color=brown>employs</FONT></I> many thousands of people. In other situations, it can seem a needless substitute for <I><FONT color=brown>use</FONT></I>, perhaps resorted to in the hope that its greater formality will lend status or objectivity: <I><FONT color=brown>employing</FONT></I> a spatula to turn the eggs. Here, the clarity and brevity of <I><FONT color=brown>use</FONT></I> would prevent pretentiousness. Similarly, use can in every instance be substituted for <B><FONT color=blue>utilize</FONT></B>, with an invariable gain in directness and clarity. But, like <I><FONT color=brown>employ</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>utilize</FONT></I> has a distinct sphere of meaning all its own, referring to the conversion necessary to make something useful, a meaning now largely ignored: underwater oil deposits that had no value before science taught us how to <I><FONT color=brown>utilize</FONT></I> them. More often, the word appears indiscriminately in place of use: <I><FONT color=brown>utilizing</FONT></I> a chafing dish to serve the casserole.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conserve">CONSERVE</A>, waste.</P>

<P>These words are used to describe things that happen in the normal course of events or are accepted by most people as natural rather than as novel or strange. <B><FONT color=blue>Usual</FONT></B> is applied to whatever recurs frequently, steadily or with relative constancy. Unlike some of these words, it may be applied to natural happenings as well as to occurrences based on the customs of a community or the habits of an individual. [Thunder is the <I><FONT color=brown>usual</FONT></I> sign of an approaching storm; Flowers are the <I><FONT color=brown>usual</FONT></I> gift for a convalescent; Playing chess is his <I><FONT color=brown>usual</FONT></I> pastime.] <B><FONT color=blue>Everyday</FONT></B> has less special meaning than any of these terms. It refers to things which simply happen without causing undue notice or concern: an <I><FONT color=brown>everyday</FONT></I> occurrence; the <I><FONT color=brown>everyday</FONT></I> give-and-take of business life.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Regular</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>ordinary</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>common</FONT></B>, in the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>usual</FONT></I>, have equally wide applications. <I><FONT color=brown>Regular</FONT></I> emphasizes a conformity to the established or natural order of things. [Overtime is work in excess of the <I><FONT color=brown>regular</FONT></I> weekly schedule; Most of us thrive on <I><FONT color=brown>regular</FONT></I> meals and <I><FONT color=brown>regular</FONT></I> hours of rest.] <I><FONT color=brown>Ordinary</FONT></I>, implying such conformity less strongly, connotes an absence of exceptional or striking characteristics: An <I><FONT color=brown>ordinary</FONT></I> work day is eight hours. <I><FONT color=brown>Common</FONT></I> also emphasizes the unexceptional, but may in some usages suggest somewhat less frequency than does <I><FONT color=brown>usual</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>common</FONT></I> household accident of slipping in the bath; the <I><FONT color=brown>usual</FONT></I> congratulations one extends to the parents of a new baby.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Customary</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>habitual</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>wonted</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>accustomed</FONT></B> and conventional seldom refer to natural occurrences except metaphorically. In most cases they indicate what is <I><FONT color=brown>usual</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Customary</FONT></I> is applied to something that characterizes a given community or person. [It is <I><FONT color=brown>customary</FONT></I> for Tibetans to put yak butter in their tea; It is <I><FONT color=brown>customary</FONT></I> for our family to sleep late on Sunday mornings.] <I><FONT color=brown>Habitual</FONT></I> refers to acts or qualities in individuals that have been strengthened by constantly repeated actions: a <I><FONT color=brown>habitual</FONT></I> chain-smoker; a <I><FONT color=brown>habitual</FONT></I> liar. <I><FONT color=brown>Wonted</FONT></I>, a word that now sounds bookish and quaint, emphasizes habituation, but is applied to both personal habits and to social customs when less stress is being laid on their fixity: returning home each evening at his <I><FONT color=brown>wonted</FONT></I> hour. <I><FONT color=brown>Accustomed</FONT></I> is often used in place of <I><FONT color=brown>customary</FONT></I> or in place of <I><FONT color=brown>wonted</FONT></I>, but suggests fixed custom less strongly than does <I><FONT color=brown>customary</FONT></I> and is less stilted than <I><FONT color=brown>wonted</FONT></I>. It often implies simply getting used to something: <I><FONT color=brown>accustomed</FONT></I> attitude of optimism. <I><FONT color=brown>Conventional</FONT></I> is the strongest of these words in suggesting the following of established custom or usage, and is emphasizes the general agreement accorded to it: It is <I><FONT color=brown>conventional</FONT></I> for men who are friends to shake hands when they meet in the street.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Daily">DAILY</A>, <A href="entry://General">GENERAL</A>, MEDIOCRE. <A href="entry://Normal">NORMAL</A>, <A href="entry://Tradition">TRADITION</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Occasional">OCCASIONAL</A>, <A href="entry://Specific">SPECIFIC</A>, <A href="entry://Unparalleled">UNPARALLELED</A>, <A href="entry://Unusual">UNUSUAL</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in that they all mean to claim or take possession of something. To <B><FONT color=blue>usurp</FONT></B> is to seize and hold in possession such a thing as a position or status that belongs to another person and to which one has no legal right, and to exercise the authority and enjoy the privileges which stem from such a position. <I><FONT color=brown>Usurp</FONT></I> pertains especially to the forcible seizure of kingly power: an upstart pretender trying to <I><FONT color=brown>usurp</FONT></I> the throne.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Appropriate</FONT></B>, as here considered, denotes the lawful or unlawful acquisition for one’s owe use of something originally belonging to another or to no one in particular.

<P>These verbs all refer to the communication of facts, thoughts, feelings, etc., especially by the medium of speech. <B><FONT color=blue>Utter</FONT></B> can apply to the making of any audible vocal sound, and is thus not confined to those disciplined sequences of sound called speech: to utter a cry of warning; to <I><FONT color=brown>utter</FONT></I> a scream of terror; to <I><FONT color=brown>utter</FONT></I> a loud oath. <I><FONT color=brown>Utter</FONT></I> often emphasizes the violence or suddenness of the sound produced, as in these examples. It may apply also to normal speech, but it used mainly to describe or summarize discourse, not in direct or indirect quotations. [He <I><FONT color=brown>uttered</FONT></I> what we were all thinking; He <I><FONT color=brown>uttered</FONT></I> the opinion that not all men were equal in ability. One would not say, "He <I><FONT color=brown>uttered</FONT></I>, 慖 will go,?quot; nor "He <I><FONT color=brown>uttered</FONT></I> that he would go." <I><FONT color=brown>Utter</FONT></I> may be used, as exemplified by the sentences in bracket above, to contrast speech with silence and to suggest a bold speaking out. In this sense the word is close to <B><FONT color=blue>pronounce</FONT></B> in meaning, but <I><FONT color=brown>pronounce</FONT></I> is more solemn in tone and more suitable to formal proceedings than ordinary discourse: The judge <I><FONT color=brown>pronounced</FONT></I> his opinion with a grave and impressive air; to <I><FONT color=brown>pronounce</FONT></I> judgement; to <I><FONT color=brown>pronounce</FONT></I> her guilty.

<P>These words all refer to conditions characterized by the absence of people or things. <B><FONT color=blue>Vacant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>empty</FONT></B>, the most general in this sense, can both mean containing or holding nothing: a <I><FONT color=brown>vacant</FONT></I> allotment; an <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> hallway. But <I><FONT color=brown>vacant</FONT></I> is usually restricted to the absence of people occupying a place, whereas empty has a much wider range of application and may refer to anything that does not have the usual or proper contents. An <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> theatre may have a few people in it, but a <I><FONT color=brown>vacant</FONT></I> theatre is one wholly without occupants and probably not in use. <I><FONT color=brown>Vacant</FONT></I> implies longer duration or a more settled state than does <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>vacant</FONT></I> flat is one that is not currently occupied by tenants and is available for renting; an <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> flat is simply one that does not have people in it at a given time: Burglars broke into the <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> flat while the tenants were away on holidays. Both <I><FONT color=brown>vacant</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> are used in extended senses that imply the lack of essential qualities. <I><FONT color=brown>Vacant</FONT></I> can mean uninspired, dull, vapid or listless, and suggests a lack of intelligence or point: a <I><FONT color=brown>vacant</FONT></I> stare. <I><FONT color=brown>Empty</FONT></I> can mean hollow, meaningless or bland, and suggests a lack of significance or substance: <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> promises; <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> dreams.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unfilled</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>open</FONT></B>, in the context of this comparison, are alike in meaning available or not taken, both refer to the absence of a person or persons from some specific position: The office manager’s job is still <I><FONT color=brown>unfilled</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>open</FONT></I>) after three months.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Unoccupied</FONT></B> is like vacant in its reference to a state created by the absence of people, but does not so strongly suggest, as <I><FONT color=brown>vacant</FONT></I> does, that the absence of occupants is temporary: an old, <I><FONT color=brown>unoccupied</FONT></I> house alleged to be haunted.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Devoid</FONT></B>, from the past participle of an obsolete word that meant to empty out, means emptied, not possessing or destitute, and is used with "of": <I><FONT color=brown>Devoid</FONT></I> of hope, the shipwreched sailors resigned themselves to the promise of never again seeing their loved ones. <I><FONT color=brown>Empty</FONT></I> also can be used in this way: The poem was <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> of beauty, and without any moral grandeur. In this sense <B><FONT color=blue>bereft</FONT></B>, the past tense and past participle of <I><FONT color=brown>bereave</FONT></I>, is also commonly used as an adjective meaning deprived: <I><FONT color=brown>bereft</FONT></I> of joy. <I><FONT color=brown>Devoid</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>bereft</FONT></I>, are used to describe the absence of physical things: a lake <I><FONT color=brown>devoid</FONT></I> of fish owing to the pollution of the water; streets <I><FONT color=brown>empty</FONT></I> of people.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Free</FONT></B>, in the sense here considered, means cleared or <I><FONT color=brown>devoid</FONT></I> of something, and is used with "of" or "from": free from any taint of scandal; <I><FONT color=brown>free</FONT></I> of infection.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Lack">LACK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: filled, full, occupied, replete.</P>

<P>These words all refer to that which is not clear to the senses or to the mind. To be <B><FONT color=blue>vague</FONT></B> is to fail, whether intentionally or accidentally, to state precisely what on means or to make oneself clearly understood. [He had only <B><FONT color=blue>vague</FONT></B> memories of his early childhood: The M.P. was <B><FONT color=blue>vague</FONT></B> about his plans, saying only that he would not refuse to stand again if selected.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Indefinite</FONT></B> means not precisely defined or limited; <B><FONT color=blue>indeterminate</FONT></B> means not definite in extent, amount or nature: <I><FONT color=brown>indefinite</FONT></I> frontiers; an illness with <I><FONT color=brown>indeterminate</FONT></I> symptoms. In short, <I><FONT color=brown>indefinite</FONT></I> means <I><FONT color=brown>vague</FONT></I>, but with the emphasis on blurred outlines or a lack of focus; that which is <I><FONT color=brown>indeterminate</FONT></I> may be quite definite, such as specific symptoms accompanying an illness that nevertheless give no clear indication as to the nature of the underlying disease. An <I><FONT color=brown>indeterminate</FONT></I> number may be definite, but simply cannot be known: An <I><FONT color=brown>indeterminate</FONT></I> number of revellers dispersed to their homes before the police could arrive.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Obscure</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>indistinct</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>hazy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>dim</FONT></B> refer to various ways by which something is blurred or hidden. <I><FONT color=brown>Obscure</FONT></I>, the strongest word, may suggest a difficulty in perception caused by a murkiness of the atmosphere; or it may suggest a difficulty in understanding caused by the complex, abstruse or ambiguous nature of the material presented. In either case the result gives only an <I><FONT color=brown>indistinct</FONT></I>, partial view of something still very much hidden from sight or sense: <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I>, muffled sounds; an <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I> outline; an <I><FONT color=brown>obscure</FONT></I> passage of the Bible. <I><FONT color=brown>Indistinct</FONT></I> emphasizes the faintness of the impression on the senses or mind as well as the blurred outlines of the whole; it is thus synonymous with one meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>vague</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>indistinct</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>vague</FONT></I>) memories. <I><FONT color=brown>Hazy</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>dim</FONT></I> suggest different ways in which perception may be rendered <I><FONT color=brown>indistinct</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Hazy</FONT></I> implies a misty but, at times, glary atmosphere impenetrable to sight; <I><FONT color=brown>dim</FONT></I> points simply to darkness. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>hazy</FONT></I> conveys a strong sense of confusion, uncertainty and blurred impressions, <I><FONT color=brown>dim</FONT></I> stresses simply the difficulty of seeing or perceiving.

<P>These words are comparable in that they all refer to someone who works for someone else, particularly in the capacity of a personal or household attendant. <B><FONT color=blue>Valet</FONT></B> denotes a male who performs such services as taking attendant. <I><FONT color=brown>Valet</FONT></I> denotes a male who performs such services as taking care of clothing and laundry for another man; in fact, such a person is often simply referred to as one’s <B><FONT color=blue>man</FONT></B>: My <I><FONT color=brown>man</FONT></I> goes everywhere with me. A <I><FONT color=brown>valet</FONT></I> is often called a gentleman’s gentleman, and his designation accurately reflects the true nature both of the man who is so employed and of the position itself. For, although it is true that any man of means can employ another male to act as his <I><FONT color=brown>valet</FONT></I>, the traditional <I><FONT color=brown>valet</FONT></I> in fact and fiction has been in service with a man of high social status. And the <I><FONT color=brown>valet</FONT></I>, probably because of the enforced intimacy of association with his gentlemanly employer, has always conducted himself, at least in fiction if not in fact, in the manner of a gentleman. (It is this customary intimacy with its inevitable destruction of dignity that made Madame Cornuel’s " No man is a hero to his <I><FONT color=brown>valet</FONT></I>" so pertinent.)</P><P>While one thinks of a <I><FONT color=brown>valet</FONT></I> in terms of devoted, deferential service, there is no implication of servility in the word <I><FONT color=brown>valet</FONT></I> as there is in <B><FONT color=blue>flunkey</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>lackey</FONT></B>. Originally, <I><FONT color=brown>flunkey</FONT></I> was a contemptuous term for a liveried manservant, especially one who served as a footman. Today <I><FONT color=brown>flunkey</FONT></I> designates any person who behaves in an excessively attentive, compliant or sycophantic way towards a person of superior rank, social position, wealth, etc. <I><FONT color=brown>lackey</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>flunkey</FONT></I>, first denoted a footman, but the word had no pejorative connotation. Today’s <I><FONT color=brown>lackey</FONT></I> is the same kind of hanger-on as the modern <I><FONT color=brown>flunkey</FONT></I>, but his role is more demanding in that it calls for him to do work of an unattractive nature: a TV star followed by the usual entourage of <I><FONT color=brown>flunkeys</FONT></I>, each trying his best to be ingratiating; the parliamentary hack whose <I><FONT color=brown>lackeys</FONT></I> did all the low-level manoeuvring that kept him in office year after year.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Servant</FONT></B> is a broad, neutral word with none of the connotations implicit in <I><FONT color=brown>flunkey</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>lackey</FONT></I>. It can refer to a personal or domestic attendant: a large household made up of a family of six plus two <I><FONT color=brown>servants</FONT></I>. It can denote any person who is employed by another: A policeman is the <I><FONT color=brown>servant</FONT></I> of the people. Finally the word can be used in impersonal contexts to mean anything that is used to serve the purpose or interests of something else: Science is the <I><FONT color=brown>servant</FONT></I> of mankind.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Orderly</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>batman</FONT></B> both have special reference to military service. An <I><FONT color=brown>orderly</FONT></I> is a private or non-commissioned officer detailed to carry orders, take messages or do other service for an officer. The word is applied also to a male attendant at any hospital. <I><FONT color=brown>Batman</FONT></I> originally designated a soldier in the British army who was in charge of a bat-horse, that is, a horse which carried baggage, especially in a military campaign. Today <I><FONT color=brown>batman</FONT></I> can refer to any personal servant of an officer in the Commonwealth armed forces.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Assistant">ASSISTANT</A>.</P>

<P>These words all mean to get the better of, especially by using physical force in battle. <B><FONT color=blue>Vanquish</FONT></B> means to defeat utterly in battle, while <B><FONT color=blue>conquer</FONT></B>, though also implying victory, gives greater emphasis to gaining mastery or control over the defeated and their territory: to <I><FONT color=brown>vanquish</FONT></I> the enemy; The Romans <I><FONT color=brown>conquered</FONT></I> parts of Britain in the 1<SUP>st</SUP> century BC. <I><FONT color=brown>Conquer</FONT></I> may apply to geographical area or to a political entity, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>vanquish</FONT></I> refers specifically to military forces. Both words may be used in extended or figurative senses: to <I><FONT color=brown>vanquish</FONT></I> fear; to <I><FONT color=brown>conquer</FONT></I> disease; to <I><FONT color=brown>conquer</FONT></I> one’s shyness.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Overpower</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>overwhelm</FONT></B> imply a disastrous defeat in which the defeated are rendered helpless by a sudden onset of superior power. <I><FONT color=brown>Overpower</FONT></I> stresses greater strength, as in numbers or weaponry; <I><FONT color=brown>overwhelm</FONT></I> implies complete and utter dominance, a one-sided victory that virtually constitutes a <B><FONT color=blue>rout</FONT></B>. <I><FONT color=brown>Rout</FONT></I>, strictly speaking, implies that the defeated are put to flight.

<P>Central to this group of words when considered as verbs is the idea of confronting an uncertain or precarious situation with the intention or hope of obtaining a satisfactory outcome.</P><P>When the purpose is to show courteous disagreement or resolve, <B><FONT color=blue>venture</FONT></B> is preferred. [I <I><FONT color=brown>venture</FONT></I> to contradict you; He <I><FONT color=brown>ventured</FONT></I> to insist on certain changes.] But if the emphasis is on challenge or defiance, the otherwise closely synonymous <B><FONT color=blue>dare</FONT></B> is more often used. [I <I><FONT color=brown>dare</FONT></I> you to do it; He wouldn’t <I><FONT color=brown>dare</FONT></I> to cancel the contract.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bet</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>gamble</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wager</FONT></B> carry the suggestion of pitting one’s wits, knowledge and resources against a set of equally probable events, only one of which is or can be favourable: to <I><FONT color=brown>bet</FONT></I> on the races; to <I><FONT color=brown>gamble</FONT></I> away a fortune at baccarat; to <I><FONT color=brown>wager</FONT></I> that a certain candidate will win an election. <I><FONT color=brown>Gamble</FONT></I>, though applicable in virtually every situation covered by the others, implies a more reckless commitment under less favourable circumstances: to <I><FONT color=brown>gamble</FONT></I> (not <I><FONT color=brown>bet</FONT></I> or<I><FONT color=brown> wager</FONT></I>) on the stock exchange. <B><FONT color=blue>Stake</FONT></B> also has the same general sense: to <I><FONT color=brown>stake</FONT></I> one’s reputation on the outcome. More specifically it means giving money or assistance in advance to further a <I><FONT color=brown>venture</FONT></I>, on condition of sharing in any gains. [He <I><FONT color=brown>staked</FONT></I> a large sum in his friend’s new factory.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Chance</FONT></B> means to happen or come about accidentally: She <I><FONT color=brown>changed</FONT></I> to find her sister at home; it may refer also to a more or less deliberate attempt to bring some desired but problematical event to pass: I'll <I><FONT color=brown>chance</FONT></I> it. In this latter sense it is nearly interchangeable with <B><FONT color=blue>risk</FONT></B>, but <I><FONT color=brown>risk</FONT></I> contains an added suggestion of a damage, loss or injury not to be lightly ignored: The general <I><FONT color=brown>risked</FONT></I> his whole campaign on the outcome of one battle. <B><FONT color=blue>Hazard</FONT></B> points up the same distinction: to <I><FONT color=brown>hazard</FONT></I> all his winnings on the next fall of the cards. But it may also substitute at a milder level for <I><FONT color=brown>venture</FONT></I>: to <I><FONT color=brown>hazard</FONT></I> a guess.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Danger">DANGER</A>, <A href="entry://Doubtful">DOUBTFUL</A>.</P>

<P>These words relate to various forms of utterance. In strict usage, <B><FONT color=blue>verbal</FONT></B> refers to the actual words used, and does not exclude the possibility of a written communication: a <I><FONT color=brown>verbal</FONT></I> dispute; <I><FONT color=brown>verbal</FONT></I> translations from the Greek; he gave his <I><FONT color=brown>verbal</FONT></I> consent to the proposals.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Oral</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>spoken</FONT></B> mean uttered or communicated by mouth: an <I><FONT color=brown>oral</FONT></I> examination in defence of one’s Ph.D. thesis; the <I><FONT color=brown>oral</FONT></I> tradition of epic poetry; a <I><FONT color=brown>spoken</FONT></I> account of his adventure. The distinction between these two words and <I><FONT color=brown>verbal</FONT></I> is often blurred by a tendency to confuse a written (or printed) communication with one that is only <I><FONT color=brown>spoken</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Verbal</FONT></I>, in short, can mean <I><FONT color=brown>oral</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>spoken</FONT></I>, but is simply less precise when so used: <I><FONT color=brown>verbal</FONT></I> testimony.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Vocal</FONT></B> retains its original and primary meaning of voice, and means having or being endowed with the power of utterance: <I><FONT color=brown>vocal</FONT></I> cords; <I><FONT color=brown>vocal</FONT></I> music; <I><FONT color=brown>vocal</FONT></I> creatures. As such it refers to anything from meaningful speech to a confused murmuring or shouting.

<P>These words refer to the use of more words than necessary to make a statement. <B><FONT color=blue>Verbose</FONT></B> is formal, <B><FONT color=blue>wordy</FONT></B> less formal and <B><FONT color=blue>long-winded</FONT></B> the most informal, but all are similar in pointing to the mere fact of an excess of words in speech or writing, without specifying further: a <I><FONT color=brown>verbose</FONT></I> chapter on foreign affairs; a <I><FONT color=brown>wordy</FONT></I> poem on a familiar subject; a <I><FONT color=brown>long-winded</FONT></I> argument. <I><FONT color=brown>Verbose</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>long-winded</FONT></I> are more general than <I><FONT color=brown>wordy</FONT></I>, since, in addition to describing a specific example of excessive wordage, they are more likely to typify a writer or speaker, particularly garrulous; a <I><FONT color=brown>verbose</FONT></I> story teller who left his captive audience stony-eyed with boredom; so <I><FONT color=brown>long-winded</FONT></I> I thought he would never finish.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Redundant</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>pleonastic</FONT></B> can pertain to a particular example or a whole statement, but rarely to a writer or speaker. In any case, they both refer to excessive wordage that results from tautological or unnecessary expressions. <I><FONT color=brown>Redundant</FONT></I> is of moderate formality and is restricted almost completely to indicating an excess caused by tautology: <I><FONT color=brown>redundant</FONT></I> phrases like "essential requisite" or fundamental basis." It is also more likely to pinpoint specific examples than to typify a whole style. <I><FONT color=brown>Pleonastic</FONT></I>, by contrast, is the most formal of these words; it can refer to specific <I><FONT color=brown>redundant</FONT></I> examples: a speech full of <I><FONT color=brown>pleonastic</FONT></I> phrases. But it is more general in pertaining, as well, to a whole speaking or writing style that is wordy or riddled with <I><FONT color=brown>redundant</FONT></I> expressions, especially when the style is complicated or pretentious: the <I><FONT color=brown>pleonastic</FONT></I> super-elegance of the standard 19<SUP>th</SUP>-century Sunday sermon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Repetitious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>diffuse</FONT></B> specify a particular fault that results in a wordy, <I><FONT color=brown>long-winded</FONT></I> or verbose style. <I><FONT color=brown>Repetitious</FONT></I> points to excess because of the needless restatement of already established points: <I><FONT color=brown>repetitious</FONT></I> commercials that relentlessly hammer home their slogans. The word can refer to the speaker or writer himself: a <I><FONT color=brown>repetitious</FONT></I> debater whose arguments approached the simple-mindedness of propaganda. <I><FONT color=brown>Diffuse</FONT></I> suggests an excess of words that results when a piece of discourse is spread out, rambling or poorly ordered in its movement from statement to statement: an essay so <I><FONT color=brown>diffuse</FONT></I> that it becomes almost impossible to grasp the points the author wishes to make.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Prolix</FONT></B> approaches <I><FONT color=brown>pleonastic</FONT></I> in formality, but is somewhat different from the rest of these words in indicating a piece of discourse that is both tedious and unnecessarily long, with the suggestion that the whole approach is excessively intricate or complicated: a <I><FONT color=brown>prolix</FONT></I> contract unintelligible to anyone but a legal expert. The word can also refer to specific examples of involuted syntax.

<P>These words refer to a line that stands so as to form a 90-degree angle with a flat, level surface. <B><FONT color=blue>Vertical</FONT></B> may stress an exact 90-degree alignment: Because the floors slanted, a level had to be used to make sure the supports for the bookcases were <I><FONT color=brown>vertical</FONT></I>. But the word is often used to indicate approximate alignment as well: the <I><FONT color=brown>vertical</FONT></I> shafts of young poplars.

In figurative uses, moral decency or resoluteness may be suggested. <B><FONT color=blue>Plumb</FONT></B> is related to a context of building or carpentry, in which it suggests that an exact <I><FONT color=brown>perpendicular</FONT></I> alignment has been achieved by use of a <I><FONT color=brown>plumb</FONT></I> line: tapping the bottom of the four-by-two until it was <I><FONT color=brown>plumb</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://High">HIGH</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: flat, horizontal, prone, prostrate, supine.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in denoting a capacity to continue living and to reproduce, either in the biological or medical sense, or figuratively. The distinctions relate chiefly to the particular context in which they are used, although some hints are given by their etymology.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Viable</FONT></B>, from the French word <I><FONT color=brown>vie</FONT></I>, means capable of living and developing normally: a <I><FONT color=brown>viable</FONT></I> weed, egg or newborn child. It has been applied also to anything thought of as being able to continue an independent existence, and in this sense has the meaning of workable or practicable: a <I><FONT color=brown>viable</FONT></I> plan or project; a <I><FONT color=brown>viable</FONT></I> arrangement.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fertile</FONT></B> goes back to the Latin <I><FONT color=brown>ferre</FONT></I>, to bear, carry or bring, and means capable of producing or reproducing, whether in a material or figurative sense: a <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I> woman; <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I> soil; a <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I> breed of cattle; a <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I> imagination; <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I> in ideas; a <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I> resourcefulness in the face of difficulties. But note that what is <I><FONT color=brown>viable</FONT></I> is not necessarily <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I>: a seed or newborn child is <I><FONT color=brown>viable</FONT></I> but can become <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I> only at a certain stage in its own development.</P><P>By extension, <B><FONT color=blue>fecund</FONT></B> suggests the actual productivity or yield of any <I><FONT color=brown>fertile</FONT></I> person or thing: a <I><FONT color=brown>fecund</FONT></I> woman, who had 12 children; a <I><FONT color=brown>fecund</FONT></I> crop; <I><FONT color=brown>fecund</FONT></I> with ideas. <B><FONT color=blue>Fruitful</FONT></B>, though often a close synonyms of <I><FONT color=brown>fecund</FONT></I>, carries the idea of something that in and of itself promotes further productivity along similar or related lines. [A well-fertilized soil is <I><FONT color=brown>fruitful</FONT></I> in crops; Newton’s laws were <I><FONT color=brown>fruitful</FONT></I> for the future development of science; The lecture led to a <I><FONT color=brown>fruitful</FONT></I> discussion.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Prolific</FONT></B> is a contraction of a medieval Latin word with the literal meaning of to make offspring or progeny. It is more widely used than <I><FONT color=brown>fecund</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>fruitful</FONT></I> to emphasize a rapid and abundant production of anything.

<P>These words refer to back-and-forth motion. <B><FONT color=blue>Vibrate</FONT></B> is the most general of these, suggesting a rapid continuing pulsation: feeling the train begin to <I><FONT color=brown>vibrate</FONT></I> with the monotonous roll of wheels along the track. <B><FONT color=blue>Oscillate</FONT></B>, a more formal word, often used in scientific contexts, applies to any regular movement back and forth, as of pendulum, or to any uncertain change of position: common stocks that <I><FONT color=brown>oscillate</FONT></I> in a predictably cyclical way; attitudes that <I><FONT color=brown>oscillated</FONT></I> between extremes of despair and hope. Apart from technical contexts and especially where uncertainty rather than regularity is intended, <I><FONT color=brown>oscillate</FONT></I> may sound stiff or ambiguous.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Swing</FONT></B>, while much more informal, relates closely to oscillate in suggesting motion like that of a pendulum or of anything stationary at one end and free at the other: <I><FONT color=brown>swinging</FONT></I> ape-like from vine to vine. Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>oscillate</FONT></I>, the word may suggest a curving movement, like that followed by a pendulum’s weight: <I><FONT color=brown>swinging</FONT></I> the car sharply to avoid being struck. It is used also to indicate a change of opinion away from an existing situation: The election result showed a decided <I><FONT color=brown>swing</FONT></I> against the government.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Undulate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sway</FONT></B> are more specific than the foregoing words. <I><FONT color=brown>Undulate</FONT></I> suggests the slow, irregular alternation of swells and hollow in an elastic surface: smooth waves <I><FONT color=brown>undulating</FONT></I> across the bay. Unlike the other words treated here, <I><FONT color=brown>undulate</FONT></I> can be applied also to things completely at rest but composed of gentle swells and hollows: foothills that <I><FONT color=brown>undulated</FONT></I> gently beside the highway. <I><FONT color=brown>Sway</FONT></I> may suggest the swelling and hollowing of a surface, like <I><FONT color=brown>undulate</FONT></I>, but most specifically it suggests the slow back-and-forth movement of something standing upright: trees <I><FONT color=brown>swaying</FONT></I> in the first gusts of the storm. This contrasts with <I><FONT color=brown>swing</FONT></I>, which strongly suggests the movement of something attached at the top and free to move at the bottom, rather than vice versa.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Fluctuate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>waver</FONT></B> refer less to physical motion than to changes in rate or changes of mind. <I><FONT color=brown>Fluctuate</FONT></I> suggests an irregular up-and-down motion or an uncertain or erratic course: share prices that <I><FONT color=brown>fluctuate</FONT></I> for no apparent reason. <I><FONT color=brown>Waver</FONT></I> stresses indecisiveness or aimlessness: <I><FONT color=brown>wavering</FONT></I> between going to the drive-in and staying at home. <I><FONT color=brown>Waver</FONT></I>, in referring to observable motion, suggests a faltering, unsteady course: the ragged caravan that <I><FONT color=brown>wavered</FONT></I> across the last mile of desert.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bounce">BOUNCE</A>, <A href="entry://Rotate">ROTATE</A>, <A href="entry://Shake">SHAKE</A>, <A href="entry://Skip">SKIP</A>, <A href="entry://Totter">TOTTER</A>.</P>

<P>These words express some of the least attractive aspects of human nature. <B><FONT color=blue>Vindictive</FONT></B> means spitefully vengeful, and suggests the harbouring of grudges for imagined wrongs until the <I><FONT color=brown>vindictive</FONT></I> person, with satisfaction and perhaps even enjoyment, sees the object of his hatred suffer. <B><FONT color=blue>Spiteful</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rancorous</FONT></B> emphasize the bitterness that attends feelings of malice and hate. <I><FONT color=brown>Rancorous</FONT></I> suggests a festering ill will, perhaps stemming from resentment over some real or fancied wrong. It does not, like <I><FONT color=brown>vindictive</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>spiteful</FONT></I>, necessarily imply a desire to hurt ?only a deep-rooted malice. <B><FONT color=blue>Resentful</FONT></B> is less intense than <I><FONT color=brown>spiteful</FONT></I>, since the <I><FONT color=brown>spiteful</FONT></I> person is actually prompted to vengeful acts, whereas the <I><FONT color=brown>resentful</FONT></I> person’s indignant anger may be suppressed or inhibited. Indeed, resentment often arises from feelings of frustration akin to envy. [The boy was <I><FONT color=brown>resentful</FONT></I> when the teacher selected another to deliver the speech of welcome; The <I><FONT color=brown>spiteful</FONT></I> girl deliberately broke the doll when she was told she couldn’t keep it.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Mean</FONT></B> is applied to base or ungenerous feelings or actions. A <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I> person or attitude is small-minded, petty and lacking in those qualities of human consideration and fair play that we tend, perhaps too hopefully, to regard as natural attributes of most people. [Her failure to invite the Harrises simply because they were not wealthy was a <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I> gesture.] Related to this sense is the informal use common in the Unite States, meaning vicious, ill-tempered or dangerous: a <I><FONT color=brown>mean</FONT></I> horse, ready to buck and throw you if you're not careful.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Venomous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>splenetic</FONT></B> refer to feelings of malignant spite. <I><FONT color=brown>Venomous</FONT></I> retains some of its basic serpentine sense of able to give a poisonous sting, and thus stresses effect as well as motive. A <I><FONT color=brown>venomous</FONT></I> review of a book suggests sharp, biting, painfully acute criticism. It also implies a personal and possibly <I><FONT color=brown>vindictive</FONT></I> motive, since the attack is too <I><FONT color=brown>strenuous</FONT></I> to issue from impartiality. <I><FONT color=brown>Splenetic</FONT></I> means fretfully spiteful or peevish. It relates, of course, to the traditional sense of spleen as the seat of various emotions, among them ill temper, spite and melancholy. Thus <I><FONT color=brown>splenetic</FONT></I> acts are moody and unpredictable, and stem from someone’s nature or condition rather than from external causes. [The last words of the dying man were characteristically <I><FONT color=brown>splenetic</FONT></I>: "Hope to see you soon."]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Malicious</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>malevolent</FONT></B> both imply the intent to do evil or to harm. <I><FONT color=brown>Malicious</FONT></I> is applied chiefly to actions and motives, <I><FONT color=brown>malevolent</FONT></I> to personal disposition. <I><FONT color=brown>Malevolent</FONT></I> has more sinister implications than <I><FONT color=brown>malicious</FONT></I>, implying a deep-seated irremediable antipathy that is manifested by wishing another ill: the <I><FONT color=brown>malevolent</FONT></I> nature of a miser; a cunning, <I><FONT color=brown>malevolent</FONT></I> smile; the <I><FONT color=brown>malicious</FONT></I> destruction of school property by vandals; a <I><FONT color=brown>malicious</FONT></I> lie.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Depraved">DEPRAVED</A>, <A href="entry://Enmity">ENMITY</A>, <A href="entry://Resentment">RESENTMENT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: benevolent, friendly, <A href="entry://Generous">GENEROUS</A>, genial, gracious, <A href="entry://Humane">HUMANE</A>, kind, well-meaning.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Virus</FONT></B>, a Latin word for "poison," is the technical name of a large class or protein substances so small that only the electron microscope can make them visible. Capable of existing indefinitely in the form of crystals, they are seemingly lifeless until contact with the appropriate cells of a living organism triggers them into a reproductive activity whose power, subtlety and virulence have given us such infective and frequently epidemic diseases as polio, smallpox, influenza, rabies and the still unpreventable common cold.</P><P>The general term for all typically one-celled forms of life is <B><FONT color=blue>micro-organism</FONT></B>, a word that includes both plants and animals. <B><FONT color=blue>Microbe</FONT></B> was popularized by Pasteur, who applied it to all forms of <I><FONT color=brown>micro-organisms</FONT></I>, replacing the much older word <B><FONT color=blue>animalcule</FONT></B>, restricted to microscopic animals and now only rarely used. Because Pasteur’s work was so largely concerned with harmful varieties, <I><FONT color=brown>microbe</FONT></I> came to suggest only those disease-producing organisms of which the correct scientific name is disease-producing organisms of which the correct scientific name is <B><FONT color=blue>pathogen</FONT></B>. In this sense it is still colloquially used: <I><FONT color=brown>microbe</FONT></I> hunters; the <I><FONT color=brown>microbe</FONT></I> of tuberculosis.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Germ</FONT></B>, as in the expression "<I><FONT color=brown>germ</FONT></I> theory of disease" made popular by the work of Koch and others, acquired a similar meaning, though strictly it refers to the living part of a seed or to any minute, not necessarily harmful, organism: a wheat <I><FONT color=brown>germ</FONT></I>; <I><FONT color=brown>germ</FONT></I> cell; <I><FONT color=brown>germ</FONT></I> plasm.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bacterium</FONT></B> (the singular of the better-known plural <B><FONT color=blue>bacteria</FONT></B>) is the inclusive term for any of numerous, widely distributed <I><FONT color=brown>micro-organisms</FONT></I>, exhibiting both plant and animal characteristics. Though most of them are harmless to man, and many are essentially to the processes of life, some are pathogens that cause serious, often fatal, diseases, such as cholera, diphtheria, tetanus, syphilis and botulism. <B><FONT color=blue>Bacillus</FONT></B>, meaning "a little rod," denotes a member of one of the three broad classes of <I><FONT color=brown>bacteria</FONT></I> identified by characteristic shapes and modes of action.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Communicable">COMMUNICABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Sickness">SICKNESS</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to seeing, whether in a literal or a metaphorical way. <B><FONT color=blue>Vision</FONT></B>, at its most limited, can refer to the proper functioning of the eyes: 20-20 <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I>; cataracts that blurred her field of <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I>. This extends readily to sharpness of understanding: a man with keen <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I>. In this sense, it can indicate thoughtfulness, foresight or acuity.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sight</FONT></B> is a less formal term for the same concept, except that it cannot refer by itself to understanding: injury that resulted in a complete loss of <I><FONT color=brown>sight</FONT></I>. Both these words can apply also to something seen. <I><FONT color=brown>Vision</FONT></I>, here, would indicate something seen in a dream or hallucination, or something that may be illusory, imaginary, ideal or supernatural: a <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I> that came to him in his sleep; a medium who summoned up a <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I> of his dead wife; his <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I> of a world free from war. <I><FONT color=brown>Sight</FONT></I>, here, may be a neutral reference to a look at something real: catching <I><FONT color=brown>sight</FONT></I> of the Southern Cross; the first <I><FONT color=brown>sight</FONT></I> he saw on disembarking. More informally, it can indicate anything that looks odd or extraordinary: a badly overdressed woman who thought she looked a <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I> but was merely a <I><FONT color=brown>sight</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Perception</FONT></B> can refer, like <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I>, to seeing, but it is more general in referring to the action of any of the other senses, as well: lacking <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I> of greens and reds; a sharp <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I> of mildew and darkness in the unlit room. The word emphasizes not merely the registering of a phenomenon but the interpreting of it by the mind, often instantaneously: His trembling hands and blank stare confirmed her earlier <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I> that he was extremely ill at ease. Carrying this tendency further, the word can indicate, like <I><FONT color=brown>vision</FONT></I>, any sharpness of understanding: a critic of keen <I><FONT color=brown>perception</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Eyesight</FONT></B> would seem to add nothing to the idea of sight itself, since no other organs than the eyes are able to see. Yet the word is firmly established in usage: insured against the loss of <I><FONT color=brown>eyesight</FONT></I>.

<P>These words all apply to organs or parts of the human body used in the production of voice, which is first produced when air is drawn from the lungs and forced between two bands or ribbons of muscle (<B><FONT color=blue>vocal cords</FONT></B>), causing their tense edges to vibrate. The <I><FONT color=brown>vocal cords</FONT></I> are located in one part of a cartilaginous box (<B><FONT color=blue>larynx</FONT></B>), which is in the upper part of the windpipe, or trachea. When seen from without, the <I><FONT color=brown>larynx</FONT></I> ?or more particularly the thyroid cartilage, the part of the <I><FONT color=brown>larynx</FONT></I> to which the <I><FONT color=brown>vocal cords</FONT></I> are attached ?appears as an irregularly shaped prominence in the throat that moves when one swallows or yawns. It is especially noticeable in men, hence its popular name <B><FONT color=blue>Adam’s apple</FONT></B>. In non-technical use the <I><FONT color=brown>larynx</FONT></I> is known simply and accurately as the <B><FONT color=blue>voice box</FONT></B>.</P><P>The space between the vocal cords is called the <B><FONT color=blue>glottis</FONT></B>. For ordinary breathing the <I><FONT color=brown>vocal cords</FONT></I> are relaxed and widely separated. For voiced sounds, including all vowels and some consonants, such as the initial sounds of "bin, zip and this," the <I><FONT color=brown>vocal cords</FONT></I> are pressed lightly together, the air forced between them produces vibration and thus voice. In whispering, the main part of the <I><FONT color=brown>glottis</FONT></I> is tightly closed, but two movable cartilage (arytenoids) which form one end of the <I><FONT color=brown>vocal cords</FONT></I> are drawn slightly apart, and the air is forced out between them, thus producing voice of a different sort from that of ordinary speech.</P><P>The <B><FONT color=blue>palate</FONT></B> refers to the roof of the mouth, and it is commonly thought of as consisting of two parts, the <B><FONT color=blue>hard palate</FONT></B> in the forward part and the <B><FONT color=blue>soft palate</FONT></B>, or <B><FONT color=blue>velum</FONT></B>, in the rear part. The <I><FONT color=brown>velum</FONT></I>, consisting of muscular tissue, acts as a valve for the production or suppression of nasality; when a nasal sound (such as the initial sound in "mouse") is to be produced, the <I><FONT color=brown>soft palate</FONT></I> moves forwards so that the stream of air, whose exit through the mouth is blocked elsewhere (in the case of "mouse" by closed lips), is forced up and out through the nose. Otherwise the <I><FONT color=brown>velum</FONT></I> is moved back and up to block the nasal exit, and the air is forced out entirely through the mouth. Of course, in reality there are many gradations between nasal and oral sounds, and a certain degree of nasality is present even when one does not intend it.</P><P>That part of the alimentary canal behind the mouth and nasal passages and extending down to the oesophagus and trachea (or windpipe) is called the pharynx, after the Greek word for throat. The pharynx is the passageway for both food and air.</P><P>The <B><FONT color=blue>uvula</FONT></B> is the soft, fleshy appendage hanging in the back of the mouth, and is part of the <I><FONT color=brown>soft palate</FONT></I>. Its chief function so far as most speakers of English are concerned seems to be to get red and inflamed when one gets a "sore throat," but in other languages and in some dialects of English it is used in the production of speech sounds.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Utter">UTTER</A>.</P>

It can refer to the approval itself: back in the twenties when short hair and short skirts were both in <I><FONT color=brown>vogue</FONT></I>. It can denote also the period of the <I><FONT color=brown>vogue</FONT></I>: during the recent <I><FONT color=brown>vogue</FONT></I> of rock-and-roll music. <I><FONT color=brown>Fashion</FONT></I>, more than <I><FONT color=brown>vogue</FONT></I>, is concerned with clothing, furniture, behaviour patterns, etc., in and of themselves. [Women’s <I><FONT color=brown>fashions</FONT></I> of that era were unflattering and unfeminine: It has become the <I><FONT color=brown>fashion</FONT></I> for royalty to appear as democratic and "folksy" as the average politician.] In reference to attire, <I><FONT color=brown>fashion</FONT></I> sometimes retains its original meaning of shape, mould, style or make: I don’t like the <I><FONT color=brown>fashion</FONT></I> of that coat. It also suggests the high social standing of people who are influential in establishing customs, making a style of dress popular, etc.: to be seen at the right places with people of <I><FONT color=brown>fashion</FONT></I>. A <I><FONT color=brown>fashion</FONT></I> that has a short but very active life is a <B><FONT color=blue>fad</FONT></B>.

A <B><FONT color=blue>rage</FONT></B> is a <I><FONT color=brown>fad</FONT></I> which is attended by violent enthusiasm and, quite often, a lack of taste or judgement: a folk-rock quartet that was a <I><FONT color=brown>rage</FONT></I> one week and a forgotten name the next. <B><FONT color=blue>Trend</FONT></B> literally means the general course, direction or line of movement followed by a coastline, river, etc. by extension, the word refers to any general course, inclination or tendency: to evaluate the <I><FONT color=brown>trends</FONT></I> in modern education.

<P>These words all mean to put an end to something. <B><FONT color=blue>Void</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>abrogate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cancel</FONT></B> are often used interchangeably with <B><FONT color=blue>invalidate</FONT></B> and with each other in specific contexts. To <I><FONT color=brown>invalidate</FONT></I> is to bring to an end the effectiveness of documents or claims. A faulty signature may <I><FONT color=brown>invalidate</FONT></I> a cheque. Evidence shown to be false may <I><FONT color=brown>invalidate</FONT></I> a claim in court. Negotiators may <I><FONT color=brown>void</FONT></I> a disputed clause in a contract, thereby <I><FONT color=brown>invalidating</FONT></I> its provisions. A government may <I><FONT color=brown>abrogate</FONT></I> a treaty, thus in effect <I><FONT color=brown>invalidating</FONT></I> it by declaring it no longer in force. A landlord may <I><FONT color=brown>cancel</FONT></I> a lease, thereby <I><FONT color=brown>invalidating</FONT></I> his tenant’s claim to shelter and his own claim to payment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Abolish</FONT></B> is applied to practices, condition s or social institutions. [New Zealand <I><FONT color=brown>abolished</FONT></I> the death penalty for murder in 1941, restored it in 1950 and <I><FONT color=brown>abolished</FONT></I> it again in 1961; The Emancipation Proclamation <I><FONT color=brown>abolished</FONT></I> slavery in the United States; Sydney’s suburban trains became one-class in 1940, when the first- and second-class distinction was <I><FONT color=brown>abolished</FONT></I>.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>nullify</FONT></B> is to prevent or end the effectiveness of some condition or activity. Often it means to counterpose an action or a condition that renders the original action or condition futile or inoperative: Counter-intelligence seeks to <I><FONT color=brown>nullify</FONT></I> the enemy’s espionage efforts. To <B><FONT color=blue>negate</FONT></B>, as here considered, is to prove an assertion false and thus render ineffective a claim based on it: The evidence of eye-witnesses <I><FONT color=brown>negated</FONT></I> the accused’s alibi. To <B><FONT color=blue>annul</FONT></B> is either to end something existing or to declare that it never really existed. An Act of Parliament may annul a charter and thus abolish its provisions. A court may <I><FONT color=brown>annul</FONT></I> a marriage, thus declaring that it never existed, rather than declaring a valid marriage at an end. To <B><FONT color=blue>repeal</FONT></B> and to <B><FONT color=blue>rescind</FONT></B> are to bring to an end the effect of a law or an order, respectively, and, by depriving them or the authority behind them, <I><FONT color=brown>invalidate</FONT></I> them. The British Government <I><FONT color=brown>repealed</FONT></I> the harsh Corn Laws in 1791.

<P>These words are comparable in that they are all used when one wishes to describe the character, speech or actions of people who have in some way offended one’s sensibilities or moral standards. <B><FONT color=blue>Vulgar</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>obscene</FONT></B> are similar in their suggestion of indelicacy or indecency, but <I><FONT color=brown>vulgar</FONT></I> points more to a lack of refinement or good taste while <I><FONT color=brown>obscene</FONT></I> suggests a preoccupation with the pornographic: displaying shockingly <I><FONT color=brown>vulgar</FONT></I> table manners; a madman shouting <I><FONT color=brown>obscene</FONT></I> epithets.</P><P>Literally, <B><FONT color=blue>coarse</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>crude</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>gross</FONT></B> refer to physical properties and carry the idea of an absence of fineness or delicacy. <I><FONT color=brown>Coarse</FONT></I> suggests roughness: a <I><FONT color=brown>coarse</FONT></I> fabric. <I><FONT color=brown>Crude</FONT></I> points to rawness or a lack of preparation: <I><FONT color=brown>crude</FONT></I> oil. <I><FONT color=brown>Gross</FONT></I> is used in reference to excessive fat: <I><FONT color=brown>gross</FONT></I> features.

vulnerable
<B><FONT color=blue>vulnerable</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>defenceless</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>exposed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>untenable</FONT></B>:

<P>These words refer to something open to attack or left unprotected from possible harm. <B><FONT color=blue>Vulnerable</FONT></B>, the most wide-ranging of these, comes from a Latin root meaning to wound; reflecting its derivation, the word can literally refer to the danger of physical wounding: the boxer’s lowered guard left him <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I> to his opponent’s jab. <I><FONT color=brown>Vulnerable</FONT></I> always stresses a lack of protection against physical or mental harm: an uncritical admiration of her husband that made her <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I> to his every whim. The word is relevant also to the context of argument, where it applies to an assertion that cannot be supported or corroborated or that is easily rebutted: a new foreign-policy statement that was <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I> to attacks from both the Left and the Right. In military strategy, it suggests a position that is liable to capture or encroachment by the enemy: attempts to lure the guerrillas into the open countryside where they would be most <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I> to air attacks; a <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I> observation post.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Defenceless</FONT></B> refers strictly to an undesirable inability to ward off harm or danger. In this sense it is more extreme than <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I>, since it suggests an utter lack of protection or precaution, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I> can suggest defences inadequate to some danger or threat. [The most massive defence system would still leave the nation <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I> to nuclear attack, though it might comfort the average citizen to think that he was not defenceless.] Defenceless adds also a note of complete helplessness: a fenceless child. <B><FONT color=blue>Exposed</FONT></B> emphasizes a lack of protection that might shield one from discomfort, harm or danger: broken windows that left their them <I><FONT color=brown>exposed</FONT></I> to the sub-zero temperatures; a battle plan that left their left flank dangerously <I><FONT color=brown>exposed</FONT></I> to attack. Sometimes the word can suggest an actual testing of something, whether or not the possibility of harm is involved: experiments in which rabbits were <I><FONT color=brown>exposed</FONT></I> to the drug as a way of checking its suitability for use by humans. Sometimes it is the risk rather than the harm that is emphasized: an attempt to track down everyone who had been <I><FONT color=brown>exposed</FONT></I> to the bacillus; his odd ideas, which left him <I><FONT color=brown>exposed</FONT></I> to ridicule.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Untenable</FONT></B> reflects its derivation from a French word in referring to what cannot be "held" ?that is, defended or maintained. In the context of argument, the word refers not only to a statement that may be refuted, as in the case of <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I>, but to one that is inherently unsound. [Although the prosecution’s case was <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I>, the defence had chosen a line of reasoning that was inept and <I><FONT color=brown>untenable</FONT></I>.] In terms of military strategy or, by extension, any form of competition, the word suggests a precarious position or deployment of forces that cannot resist attack: an <I><FONT color=brown>untenable</FONT></I> beachhead, <I><FONT color=brown>exposed</FONT></I> to attack from high ground on all three sides. The word suggests a greater certainty of defeat than <I><FONT color=brown>vulnerable</FONT></I> and almost as much as <I><FONT color=brown>defenceless</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Powerless">POWERLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Protect">PROTECT</A>, <A href="entry://Uphold">UPHOLD</A>, <A href="entry://Weak">WEAK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: fortified, guarded, <A href="entry://Impenetrable">IMPENETRABLE</A>, impregnable, invincible, protected, unassailable.</P>

<P>These words all refer to emerging from sleep. Four of these verbs, <B><FONT color=blue>wake</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>waken</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>awake</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>awaken</FONT></B>, are so closely connected that their inflected forms are, for the most part, used interchangeably. Certain distinctions of taste can be felt in some cases. A tendency has been noted to prefer <I><FONT color=brown>awake</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>awaken</FONT></I> in figurative use: His suspicions were <I><FONT color=brown>awakened</FONT></I>; a country <I><FONT color=brown>awakening</FONT></I> to new challenges. <I><FONT color=brown>Awake</FONT></I> may be preferred in referring to the condition of wakefulness or alertness: I am fully <I><FONT color=brown>awake</FONT></I>. In reference to the emergence from sleep itself, <I><FONT color=brown>wake</FONT></I> is most common: I <I><FONT color=brown>wake</FONT></I> at seven each morning.</P><P>In other cases, little distinction exists among these for words. Thus one may say I <I><FONT color=brown>woke</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>awoke</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>wakened</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>awakened</FONT></I>. The forms I <I><FONT color=brown>waked</FONT></I> and I <I><FONT color=brown>awaked</FONT></I> are also heard, although much less commonly; <I><FONT color=brown>waked</FONT></I> is sometimes reserved for transitive constructions: I <I><FONT color=brown>waked</FONT></I> him at noon. All these forms are acceptable; all mean the same thing. The most common past tense, however, is <I><FONT color=brown>woke</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Wakened</FONT></I> and awakened are usually felt to be more formal, although they seem to be the preferred forms for passive constructions: I was <I><FONT color=brown>awakened</FONT></I> by a loud noise. <I><FONT color=brown>Woke</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>woken</FONT></I> are accepted as standard forms in English. <I><FONT color=brown>Awoken</FONT></I> is seldom used. For the past participle, <I><FONT color=brown>waked</FONT></I> is probably the simplest and most direct, but many people avoid this form as questionable or uncomfortable and use the more natural-sounding <I><FONT color=brown>awakened</FONT></I>. [I generally <I><FONT color=brown>wake</FONT></I> early, but yesterday I <I><FONT color=brown>woke</FONT></I> two hours later than usual. In fact, I have not <I><FONT color=brown>awakened</FONT></I> so late in years.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Wake up</FONT></B> gives the most informal or emphatic tone of any of these forms. [She had to <I><FONT color=brown>wake up</FONT></I> several times a night when their baby was ill; <I><FONT color=brown>Wake up</FONT></I>!] It retains its informal flavour in transitive use: I volunteered to <I><FONT color=brown>wake</FONT></I> her <I><FONT color=brown>up</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rise</FONT></B> is most often used to refer strictly to the daily act of waking and getting out of bed. [They <I><FONT color=brown>rose</FONT></I> early that morning; <I><FONT color=brown>Rise</FONT></I> and shine!] Sometimes it can make a distinction between <I><FONT color=brown>waking</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>getting up</FONT></I>. [She <I><FONT color=brown>woke</FONT></I> at dawn but didn’t <I><FONT color=brown>rise</FONT></I> for another hour.] Unlike <I><FONT color=brown>rise</FONT></I>, <B><FONT color=blue>rouse</FONT></B> cannot be used intransitively, although in reflexive constructions it can suggest a difficult or slow act of <I><FONT color=brown>awaking</FONT></I> or emerging from a quiescent state: He struggled to <I><FONT color=brown>rouse</FONT></I> himself from sleep. By contrast, the word can suggest, in the passive, an easy waking, as from a light sleep: <I><FONT color=brown>roused</FONT></I> by the birds singing outside his window. In the active voice, the word can stress the effort to <I><FONT color=brown>awaken</FONT></I> someone else: trying unsuccessfully to <I><FONT color=brown>rouse</FONT></I> him from his nightmare.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Incite">INCITE</A>, <A href="entry://Stimulate">STIMULATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: lull, <A href="entry://Retire">RETIRE</A>, sleep, slumber.</P>

<P>These words relate to ways people move on foot. All are of moderate informality. <B><FONT color=blue>Walk</FONT></B> is the most general and neutral of these, encompassing all manner of moving on foot short of running or leaping. <B><FONT color=blue>Stride</FONT></B> refers to a swift, purposeful way of walking; it suggests long steps and an energetic rhythm: <I><FONT color=brown>striding</FONT></I> through the station a few minutes before the train’s departure. <B><FONT color=blue>Amble</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>stroll</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>saunter</FONT></B>, in sharp contrast with <I><FONT color=brown>stride</FONT></I>, suggest a slow, wandering movement without a clear-cut goal; each may furthermore suggest laziness, leisure, indecisiveness or simply the enjoyment of walking. <I><FONT color=brown>Amble</FONT></I> emphasizes a leisurely but even movement, smooth and uninterrupted: <I><FONT color=brown>ambling</FONT></I> along without stopping at any of the displays. The smooth, swaying motion suggested derives from a horse’s <I><FONT color=brown>amble</FONT></I>, in which two feet on one side are lifted together, alternately, with the two feet on the other side. <I><FONT color=brown>Stroll</FONT></I> emphasizes a slower movement, more wandering and aimless, with suggestions of many starts and pauses: <I><FONT color=brown>strolling</FONT></I> through the park with an occasional rest on a secluded bench. <I><FONT color=brown>Saunter</FONT></I> suggests an even movement, like <I><FONT color=brown>amble</FONT></I>, but it emphasizes ebullience of mood as well. One might <I><FONT color=brown>stroll</FONT></I> while concerned with disagreeable thoughts, but one would hardly <I><FONT color=brown>saunter</FONT></I> in such a state of mind: whistling as he <I><FONT color=brown>sauntered</FONT></I> along the beach.</P><P>The rest of these words describe the manner of a person’s walk rather than commenting on its larger intent. <B><FONT color=blue>Strut</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>swagger</FONT></B> intensify the cheerfulness of <I><FONT color=brown>saunter</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Swagger</FONT></I> suggests showy over-confidence or inflated egotism; it applies mostly as a negative comment: <I><FONT color=brown>swaggering</FONT></I> through crowds of autograph-seekers. <I><FONT color=brown>Strut</FONT></I> is even more disapproving in tone than swagger, suggesting an affected posture of bombastic self-importance: the politician who <I><FONT color=brown>strutted</FONT></I> about the room like a latter-day Napoleon.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Waddle</FONT></B> means to walk with short steps, swaying from side to side like a duck.

<P>These words refer to motion or to travel that is slow, aimless, pointless or without purpose or goal. <B><FONT color=blue>Wander</FONT></B> suggests a slow but possibly steady rate of movement. It usually indicates action that is idle or without purpose and is often applied to the movement of water, to travel or to verbal discourse: a stream that <I><FONT color=brown>wandered</FONT></I> through the hilly countryside; nomadic tribes that <I><FONT color=brown>wander</FONT></I> through the desert from oasis to oasis; a disorganized speech that <I><FONT color=brown>wandered</FONT></I> badly from example to example without ever coming to the point. As can be seen, the word acquires a severely negative tone when applied to verbal discourse, emphasizing confusion or ineptness.</P><P>In the same context, <B><FONT color=blue>meander</FONT></B> might suggest an amused rather than a disapproving tone: an old bushman whose anecdotes seemed to <I><FONT color=brown>meander</FONT></I> on without end. More concretely, <I><FONT color=brown>meander</FONT></I> suggests the movement of water: creeks <I><FONT color=brown>meandering</FONT></I> through green paddocks. The word is less often used for travel, although here it can give a tone of amiable idleness: <I><FONT color=brown>meandering</FONT></I> round the city markets to fill in time. When used in the context of travel, <B><FONT color=blue>ramble</FONT></B>, like <I><FONT color=brown>meander</FONT></I>, usually refers to a specific occasion rather than a habitual way of life. It can give a tone of pleasant relaxation, like <I><FONT color=brown>meander</FONT></I>, but is more concrete in suggesting a particular manner of walking, one in which a sauntering gait is linked with a start-and-stop unevenness of speed; We went <I><FONT color=brown>rambling</FONT></I> through the park every weekend; a couple who liked to <I><FONT color=brown>ramble</FONT></I> about the countryside in search of a secluded picnic spot. When used of discourse, the word takes on a negative tone like that of <I><FONT color=brown>wander</FONT></I>, referring specifically to any presentation in language that is lengthy, poorly organized and full of digressions: yawning while his wife <I><FONT color=brown>rambled</FONT></I> on about one trivial grievance after another; an essay that <I><FONT color=brown>rambles</FONT></I> too much to have any persuasive force.</P><P>Unlike the previous words, <B><FONT color=blue>roam</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>range</FONT></B> may both suggest a more serious purpose behind the uneven or circuitous movement. [He <I><FONT color=brown>roamed</FONT></I> through the island in search of his vanished father; The student’s report <I><FONT color=brown>ranged</FONT></I> through a dozen cultures to cite examples supporting his thesis.] <B><FONT color=blue>Roam</FONT></B> can, like <I><FONT color=brown>ramble</FONT></I>, be used to describe a pleasant <I><FONT color=brown>stroll</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>roaming</FONT></I> about the hills picking a bunch of wildflowers. The implication of making a thorough search or having some other specific purpose in mind is seldom completely absent, however: <I><FONT color=brown>roaming</FONT></I> about dusty galleries in search of unauthenticated paintings. <I><FONT color=brown>Roam</FONT></I> is furthermore the only word here that is specifically associated with the grazing or foraging activity of horses and other animals: letting his horse <I><FONT color=brown>roam</FONT></I> free so that she could eat her fill of grass. <I><FONT color=brown>Range</FONT></I> implies a thorough or systematic movement over a wide area: His search ranged over three continents and twice took him across the Pacific Ocean. More often it refers to a sorting through or presenting of diverse ideas. More formal than <I><FONT color=brown>roam</FONT></I>, the word also suggest more certainty of purpose, a deliberately various course, and a wide grasp of far-flung materials: books <I><FONT color=brown>ranging</FONT></I> from popular fiction to a learned treatises.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Rove</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>stray</FONT></B> both most readily suggest negative aspects of idle movement. <I><FONT color=brown>Rove</FONT></I> can sometimes indicate the pleasant overtones of <I><FONT color=brown>meander</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>ramble</FONT></I>; often it suggests a greater intensity or a more clearly defined goal, but particularly a more fickle attitude towards the experience at hand. As such, the word often suggests a cynical inconstancy in love: always on the go, <I><FONT color=brown>roving</FONT></I> from one woman to another, never satisfied for long; a <I><FONT color=brown>roving</FONT></I> eye. <I><FONT color=brown>Stray</FONT></I>, by contrast, is the one word here that specifically emphasizes someone who has lost his way or inadvertently drifted off-course; with this sense, it can apply in any context, including those that circumscribe other words here: constantly <I><FONT color=brown>straying</FONT></I> from the main point of his talk; to <I><FONT color=brown>stray</FONT></I> from the prescribed route laid down by one’s guide. Like <I><FONT color=brown>rove</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>stray</FONT></I> may refer to unfaithfulness in love, but more generally the word refers to outright sinfulness of any sort: wives earnestly trying to win back husbands who have <I><FONT color=brown>strayed</FONT></I>; inevitable that humanity would <I><FONT color=brown>stray</FONT></I> from its ideal standards of conduct.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Circumlocution">CIRCUMLOCUTION</A>, <A href="entry://Extend">EXTEND</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Remain">REMAIN</A>, rest, settle.</P>

Furthermore, while a <I><FONT color=brown>wanderer</FONT></I> might be part of a group and move about with it, <I><FONT color=brown>drifter</FONT></I> introduces an implication of solitary movement: There were signs that a <I><FONT color=brown>drifter</FONT></I> had built his campfire there, stayed a day or two, and then moved on. The word is rare in this sense, but is used to describe an aimless person: a <I><FONT color=brown>drifter</FONT></I> who never seemed to stay long in one job.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Nomad</FONT></B>, and <B><FONT color=blue>fugitive</FONT></B> both carry suggestions as to the reason for the homelessness or restlessness in question. <I><FONT color=brown>Nomad</FONT></I>, most strictly, refers to one of a group that moves about together for hunting or trading or in accord with the seasons: Asiatic <I><FONT color=brown>nomads</FONT></I> who brought strange cultural artifacts with them into Europe; <I><FONT color=brown>nomads</FONT></I> who take their herds into the mountains during the summer. In less restricted use, <I><FONT color=brown>nomad</FONT></I> may refer to anyone who moves frequently for any reason: the phenomenon of some surfers as sporting <I><FONT color=brown>nomads</FONT></I> moving from beach to beach in search of a good wave. <I><FONT color=brown>Fugitive</FONT></I> suggests secretive movement to escape capture: detectives who traced the trail of the <I><FONT color=brown>fugitive</FONT></I> through three cities.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Itinerant</FONT></B> suggests constant movement involving short stays at different places ?"here today and gone tomorrow": Because of his job, the shearer led the life of a veritable <I><FONT color=brown>itinerant</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Tramp</FONT></B> specifically suggests a lone man with no monetary resources who floats about the country, living off odd jobs and hand-outs: the grizzled old <I><FONT color=brown>tramp</FONT></I> in tattered clothes who knocked on the screen door and asked if he could chop some wood in exchange for his breakfast. <B><FONT color=blue>Sundowner</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>swagman</FONT></B> are two surviving Australian terms for those who, in earlier, colonial days and in bad times, found it necessary to move from place to place. The words are almost interchangeable now, but to many the <I><FONT color=brown>swagman</FONT></I> is the <I><FONT color=brown>itinerant</FONT></I> prepared to work and the <I><FONT color=brown>sundowner</FONT></I> one who arrives at sundown when it is too late for a job but time for a hand-out: The <I><FONT color=brown>swagman</FONT></I> is welcome when things are busy around the station: a <I><FONT color=brown>sundowner</FONT></I> hoping for a good meal from the farmer’s wife.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Vagrant</FONT></B> may be a more formal term for a person of no fixed abode, but this meaning is sometimes obscured by the fact that the word can also be a legal catch-all for a person committing any of a number of minor offences completely unrelated to sporadic movement from place to place. <I><FONT color=brown>Vagrancy</FONT></I> is a common charge against people who have no visible means of support, for example, a dollar or two on their person. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>vagrant</FONT></I> can suggest someone who wanders in search of work: <I><FONT color=brown>vagrants</FONT></I> who went from farm to farm and worked wherever casual hands were needed. <B><FONT color=blue>Vagabond</FONT></B>, when it is not used interchangeably with vagrant, suggests a lazy, cheerful drifter: heavily romanticized portraits of gipsy <I><FONT color=brown>vagabonds</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Hippie">HIPPIE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: habitant, resident, settler.</P>

<P>These words refer to a gradual decrease in quantity, size, rate or intensity. <B><FONT color=blue>Wane</FONT></B> is most concretely used to describe the slow decrease in the lit portion of the moon, following its full phase. It is widely used as well for any process of attrition: watching the patient’s stamina <I><FONT color=brown>wane</FONT></I> from day to day; hoping that the enemy’s morale would <I><FONT color=brown>wane</FONT></I> as the siege continued. In such uses there is no implication of a cyclical recovery, as is true of the moon. <B><FONT color=blue>Fade</FONT></B> implies even more strongly an irreversible process. Most concretely, it refers to a loss of intensity or distinctness in a colour or marking. The process suggested, in any case, might be more drawn out than for <I><FONT color=brown>wane</FONT></I>: a memory that <I><FONT color=brown>faded</FONT></I> year by year. <I><FONT color=brown>Fade</FONT></I>, in fact, is often used to suggest attrition caused by the passage of time: a striking beauty that the years had <I><FONT color=brown>faded</FONT></I>. <B><FONT color=blue>Ebb</FONT></B> refers to the running out of a tide; even in other uses, the reference is often to a diminished rate of flow: a pulse that <I><FONT color=brown>ebbed</FONT></I> and became almost indistinct. In general, <I><FONT color=brown>ebb</FONT></I> suggests a shorter period of time than wane, thus contrasting strongly with fade. On the other hand, both <I><FONT color=brown>ebb</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>fade</FONT></I> refer most often to a decline from a better to a worse state, whereas wane can be applied more widely: waiting for his anger to <I><FONT color=brown>wane</FONT></I> and his good humour to return. Inconsistently enough, <I><FONT color=brown>ebb</FONT></I> is sometimes used to suggest a slow recovery: feeling his strength <I><FONT color=brown>ebb</FONT></I> back.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Slacken</FONT></B> is far less concrete than the previous words, referring neutrally to any slow decrease. <I><FONT color=brown>Slacken</FONT></I> suggests a decrease in rate, volume or pressure: in the summer when the hectic pace <I><FONT color=brown>slackened</FONT></I> a bit. <I><FONT color=brown>Slacken</FONT></I>, unlike the foregoing words, may suggest a voluntary adjustment: <I><FONT color=brown>slackening</FONT></I> my stride so that she could catch up with me.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Ease</FONT></B>, usually followed by "up" or "off," has the same meaning as slacken but is more informal and generally applies to something difficult, annoying, risky or painful: Wait until the rain <I><FONT color=brown>eases off</FONT></I>; You’d better <I><FONT color=brown>ease up</FONT></I> on your drinking.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Decrease">DECREASE</A>, <A href="entry://Lessen">LESSEN</A>, <A href="entry://Reduce">REDUCE</A>, <A href="entry://Weaken">WEAKEN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: brighten, <A href="entry://Enlarge">ENLARGE</A>, mount, multiply, rise, wax.</P>

<P>These words refer to feelings of need for some sort of object or satisfaction. <B><FONT color=blue>Want</FONT></B> is the most general and informal of these. It can range in intensity from expressing a weak preference or inclination to the most extreme states of need or passion: asking if he <I><FONT color=brown>wanted</FONT></I> more butter; <I><FONT color=brown>wanting</FONT></I> very much to see a film; <I><FONT color=brown>wanting</FONT></I> the new sports car more than anything in the world; gasping out how desperately he <I><FONT color=brown>wanted</FONT></I> her. The word can also convey, more simply, a lack of the necessities of life, whether consciously expressed or not: peasants who <I><FONT color=brown>wanted</FONT></I> food, clothing and decent homes.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Wish</FONT></B> is like wise very general and wide-ranging in application. It can suggest mental fantasy, as in a daydream, and can express regret for past action or hopes about the future, whether they be realistic or not: <I><FONT color=brown>wishing</FONT></I> that a Prince Charming would come along and rescue her from her drab existence; <I><FONT color=brown>wishing</FONT></I> that he hadn’t made such a fool of himself the night before; <I><FONT color=brown>wishing</FONT></I> to do well in the exam tomorrow; <I><FONT color=brown>wishing</FONT></I> that one day he would be a millionaire. <I><FONT color=brown>Wish</FONT></I> can be used also as a slightly more formal equivalent of want: Do you <I><FONT color=brown>wish</FONT></I> another helping of meat?</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Desire</FONT></B> can also function as a more formal substitute for want: asking if he <I><FONT color=brown>desired</FONT></I> another drink; the many people who <I><FONT color=brown>desire</FONT></I> better working conditions and more education for their children. The special province of the word is in referring to sexual or sensual appetite or need: a growing sexual hunger that more and more <I><FONT color=brown>desired</FONT></I> expression; <I><FONT color=brown>desiring</FONT></I> her more intensely than any woman he had ever know; <I><FONT color=brown>desiring</FONT></I> all sorts of sybaritic pleasures.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Crave</FONT></B>, in its most restricted use, relates most concretely to hunger: surprised to find himself <I><FONT color=brown>craving</FONT></I> a taste of Chinese food. The word is widely used in other ways, to suggest either a mild hankering or a gnawing inclination: <I><FONT color=brown>craving</FONT></I> a change of pace in their humdrum life. It can even, by an analogy comparing hunger to sexual appetite, refer unambiguously to intense erotic need: <I><FONT color=brown>craving</FONT></I> another long kiss and close embrace. In this case, it stresses mere appetite, whereas desire might sometimes more inclusively suggest a tincture of love and affection as well. <B><FONT color=blue>Covet</FONT></B> most specifically refers to a longing to possess the material goods or anything that rightfully belongs to someone else: <I><FONT color=brown>coveting</FONT></I> his neighbour’s land; <I><FONT color=brown>coveting</FONT></I> his fiend’s wife. As now used, the word may suggest a feeling as weak as that indicated by wish or as persistent as that suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>craving</FONT></I>. It may suggest harmless envy or a poisonous determination to possess: <I><FONT color=brown>coveting</FONT></I> the unrestrained exuberance of the other people at the party; <I><FONT color=brown>coveting</FONT></I> the jewels that lay unattended on the table.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Emotion">EMOTION</A>, <A href="entry://Erotic">EROTIC</A>, <A href="entry://Greedy">GREEDY</A>, <A href="entry://Hope">HOPE</A>, <A href="entry://Yearn">YEARN</A>.</P>

<P>These words denote various types of localized swellings or inflamed places on the skin that are caused by certain micro-organisms. <B><FONT color=blue>Wart</FONT></B> refers to a hard, non-malignant lump formed on and rooted in the skin, usually somewhere on the hands or feet. Although caused by a virus, <I><FONT color=brown>warts</FONT></I> are not inflamed or purulent and sometimes remain for long periods without treatment only to disappear spontaneously.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pustule</FONT></B> is the general medical term for any small, rounded swelling on the skin with an inflamed base containing pus, whether occurring singly or over wide areas of the body, as in certain infectious diseases. A <B><FONT color=blue>pimple</FONT></B>, which is an inflammation of a sebaceous gland, appears most commonly on the face, especially during adolescence. A <B><FONT color=blue>boil</FONT></B> (in medical terminology, a <I><FONT color=brown>furuncle</FONT></I>) is larger and more painful than a <I><FONT color=brown>pimple</FONT></I>, as it involves not only the skin but, to a greater extent, the tissues directly beneath it. <I><FONT color=brown>Boilds</FONT></I> have a central core of dead tissue surrounded by pus. A <B><FONT color=blue>carbuncle</FONT></B> is similar to a <I><FONT color=brown>boil</FONT></I>, but is much larger, more serious, and may be accompanied by fever. <B><FONT color=blue>Sites</FONT></B> appear only on the edge of the eyelid and, like <I><FONT color=brown>pimples</FONT></I>, arise from infected sebaceous glands. The <B><FONT color=blue>cold sore</FONT></B> (or <B><FONT color=blue>fever blister</FONT></B>, as it is sometimes called) is an eruption of small blisters on or near the lips and is caused by a virus. <I><FONT color=brown>Cold sores</FONT></I> frequently accompany a cold or a fever.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Mole">MOLE</A>, <A href="entry://Neoplasm">NEOPLASM</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to lack of strength or health or to an inability to bear strain or pressure. <B><FONT color=blue>Weak</FONT></B> is the most general of these, carrying no implications as to how the lack of strength came about. It may be used in a purely physical sense: <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> and dizzy after a fainting spell; born with <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> eyesight; walls that without buttressing would have been too <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> to bear their own weight. It may refer to a lack of mental or moral strength, indicating instability of character or deficient will power: a <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> youth, easily led astray by bad associates. Sometimes <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> simply points to a lack of influence or authority: a government with a <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> executive branch and a strong legislature. Generally, it may refer to any lack of normal power, strength or potency: a <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> voice; <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> coffee; a <I><FONT color=brown>weak</FONT></I> link in a chain.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Frail</FONT></B>, when used of a person, stresses an extremely slender, delicate or sickly physique: <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> and undernourished children who stared out from the windows of the tenement. In other situations, the word suggests something easily broken or unable to resist an opposing force: <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> porphyry columns long since snapped in two; a <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> theory that even the average person could refute. It is used colloquially to indicate a temporary unwell feeling, usually after too much to drink: a little <I><FONT color=brown>frail</FONT></I> after last night’s party. <B><FONT color=blue>Infirm</FONT></B> concentrates on a lack of soundness that is either inherent or that results from ageing, illness or the like: an <I><FONT color=brown>infirm</FONT></I> constitution inherited from his father’s side of the family; a mind that had grown <I><FONT color=brown>infirm</FONT></I> with poverty, sickness and old age. Used more abstractly, the word suggests a thoroughgoing faultiness resulting from incorrect methods of working: <I><FONT color=brown>infirm</FONT></I> conclusions based on deliberate distortions of the evidence. It may also point to a lack of stability or firmness, meaning irresolute or insecure: <I><FONT color=brown>infirm</FONT></I> of purpose; an <I><FONT color=brown>infirm</FONT></I> prop.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Feeble</FONT></B> suggests a lack of strength that results in a fitful but always subnormal performance marked by a pitiable lack of alertness or resilience: a hand so <I><FONT color=brown>feeble</FONT></I> that it could scarcely lift the cup from its saucer; <I><FONT color=brown>feeble-minded</FONT></I>. When used of the human body, it generally suggests that a process of attrition has occurred. Used literally of things, it may mean faint or inadequate: a <I><FONT color=brown>feeble</FONT></I> light; a <I><FONT color=brown>feeble</FONT></I> cry; a <I><FONT color=brown>feeble</FONT></I> defence system. Used of abstract things or of ideas, it points to ineffectuality, pointlessness or pitiable performance: a <I><FONT color=brown>feeble</FONT></I> effort at courtesy; a <I><FONT color=brown>feeble</FONT></I> joke; a <I><FONT color=brown>feeble</FONT></I> interpretation of the play.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Debilitated</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>decrepit</FONT></B> specifically suggest the sapping of strength formerly present. <I><FONT color=brown>Debilitated</FONT></I> by the ravaging disease; a house <I><FONT color=brown>debilitated</FONT></I> by its long exposure to the elements. <I><FONT color=brown>Decrepit</FONT></I> specifically restricts itself to a loss of strength or usefulness because of advanced age: <I><FONT color=brown>decrepit</FONT></I> dodders in the rest home; musty stairs grown so <I><FONT color=brown>decrepit</FONT></I> that they groaned under a child’s weight.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bony">BONY</A>, <A href="entry://Flimsy">FLIMSY</A>, <A href="entry://Fragile">FRAGILE</A>, <A href="entry://Powerless">POWERLESS</A>, <A href="entry://Sickness">SICKNESS</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: energetic, hardy, <A href="entry://Healthy">HEALTHY</A>, <A href="entry://Husky">HUSKY</A>, resolute, stout, strong, sturdy, tough.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Weaken</FONT></B>, the most general word of this group, refers to the lessening of strength or power of a person, organization or force: a political party <I><FONT color=brown>weakened</FONT></I> by dissension among its leading members; He was so <I><FONT color=brown>weakened</FONT></I> by the disease that he could barely stand up. <B><FONT color=blue>Enervate</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>sap</FONT></B> both mean to lessen the vitality or strength of; both are applied only to people. <I><FONT color=brown>Sap</FONT></I> implies a gradual or insidious loss of strength; <I><FONT color=brown>enervate</FONT></I> focuses on a loss of vitality and a general lassitude, as after an illness, during a spell of hot weather or because of a loss of moral fibre. [The emotional strain of attending to his dying mother <I><FONT color=brown>sapped</FONT></I> all his strength; After his illness, he felt <I><FONT color=brown>enervated</FONT></I> and listless; The youth was <I><FONT color=brown>enervated</FONT></I> by dissipation.] <B><FONT color=blue>Enfeeble</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>enervate</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>sap</FONT></I> in being used chiefly of human beings. It differs, though, in indicating an extreme weakening, as through long, debilitating illness or serious deprivation, and in suggesting a resultant helplessness: <I><FONT color=brown>enfeebled</FONT></I> by the insidious spread of cancer; prisoners of war <I><FONT color=brown>enfeebled</FONT></I> by chronic undernourishment.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Exhaust</FONT></B> means to use up and to empty utterly, while <B><FONT color=blue>deplete</FONT></B> means to lessen the resources of a thing. To <I><FONT color=brown>deplete</FONT></I> one’s store of ammunition is to lower it to the point of danger; to <I><FONT color=brown>exhaust</FONT></I> it is to have none left. <I><FONT color=brown>Deplete</FONT></I> is often used of natural resources to express alarm at the reckless or wasteful use of unrecoverable materials: a bill that would prevent our shrinking preserve of virgin timberland from being further <I><FONT color=brown>depleted</FONT></I>. Where <I><FONT color=brown>deplete</FONT></I> refers to quantities, exhaust may also refer to qualities that cannot be measured. <B><FONT color=blue>Spend</FONT></B> is close to <I><FONT color=brown>exhaust</FONT></I>, but shares with <I><FONT color=brown>sap</FONT></I> the connotation of gradual exhaustion, a using up by degrees. [The candidate’s energy was <I><FONT color=brown>spent</FONT></I> after the long and arduous campaign.] <I><FONT color=brown>Spend</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>exhaust</FONT></I> may apply to anything giving power.

<P>These words refer to what one owns or has, such as money, land or other possessions of value. <B><FONT color=blue>Wealth</FONT></B>, considered in its concrete rather than its abstract sense, is a broad word meaning a store or accumulation of anything that men desire to possess. It is used especially of material things having economic utility or monetary value, and may be applied to individuals, groups or inanimate entities: a man of <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I>; a nation’s <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I>. In a broader sense, <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I> may refer to the possession of non-material things of value and may indicate a great abundance of anything: a <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I> of experience; a <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I> of learning.</P><P>The other words in this set are used to denote specific kinds <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I> of. <B><FONT color=blue>Property</FONT></B> and <I><FONT color=brown>estate</FONT></I> generally refer to material possessions. <I><FONT color=brown>Property</FONT></I> is the broader terms, referring to any object of value that a person or group may lawfully acquire and own: private <I><FONT color=brown>property</FONT></I>; government <I><FONT color=brown>property</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Property</FONT></I> may be either real or personal; that is, it may consist of <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I> regarded as immovable or permanent, such as land or buildings, or of <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I> regarded as movable or temporary, such as jewellery, books, furniture and the like. <I><FONT color=brown>Estate</FONT></I> may refer to a usually extensive piece of landed property or to the residence built upon it: a country <I><FONT color=brown>estate</FONT></I>. In another sense, the term designates the entire <I><FONT color=brown>property</FONT></I> and possessions of a dead person or of a bankrupt: to settle creditors?claims against a millionaire’s <I><FONT color=brown>estate</FONT></I>. Certain intangible rights also are referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>property</FONT></I>, such as copyrights, patents and the like, and may be included in a deceased’s <I><FONT color=brown>estate</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Assets</FONT></B> is a legal and commercial term used to designate sources of <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I> as opposed to liabilities. The <I><FONT color=brown>assets</FONT></I> of a person, partnership or company are all the real and personal <I><FONT color=brown>property</FONT></I> that could be converted into money if necessary for the payment of debts or legacies. In a literal sense, land, buildings, furniture, supplies, equipment, stocks, bonds and savings are <I><FONT color=brown>assets</FONT></I>. By extension, useful characteristics and attributes are often referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>assets</FONT></I>: An outgoing personality is a definite <I><FONT color=brown>asset</FONT></I> to a salesman.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Means</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>resources</FONT></B> are <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I>, particularly material possessions, that can be readily utilized for general or specific purposes. A man of <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> is presumed to possess money or negotiable <I><FONT color=brown>assets</FONT></I> sufficient to procure satisfactions in excess of bare necessities. The word <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I> is sometimes qualified to indicate strictly limited funds: working girls of slender <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I>. Or it may simply refer to one’s budget or to money available for spending: an expenditure beyond her <I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I>; to give children equal opportunity for education, regardless of their families?<I><FONT color=brown>means</FONT></I>. The term <I><FONT color=brown>resources</FONT></I> implies the existence of a reserve supply of <I><FONT color=brown>wealth</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>assets</FONT></I> that can be drawn upon when needed. An individual’s <I><FONT color=brown>resources</FONT></I> may include his bank account, his business and his credit standing.

<B><FONT color=blue>wealthy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>affluent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>flush</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>loaded</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>opulent</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>prosperous</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>rich</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>successful</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>well off</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>well-to-do</FONT></B>:

<P>These words are all used to characterize people who possess a large share of money, real-estate holdings and other things of value. <B><FONT color=blue>Wealthy</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>rich</FONT></B> are the most general of the terms that specifically apply to owning goods or having money. To call a person <I><FONT color=brown>wealthy</FONT></I> often suggests that he is an established and prominent member of the community: one of our most <I><FONT color=brown>wealthy</FONT></I> citizens. <I><FONT color=brown>Rich</FONT></I> is blunter in tone and indicates only the possession of many goods or much money; it is therefore more forceful and impressive when the object is to emphasize thee great extent of someone’s wealth. [He was not merely <I><FONT color=brown>wealthy</FONT></I> ?he was <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I>; By cunning manipulation of his holdings he became a <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I> man before he was forty.] <B><FONT color=blue>Wealthy</FONT></B> can be used flexibly to describe various levels of wealth; a moderately <I><FONT color=brown>wealthy</FONT></I> family. <I><FONT color=brown>Rich</FONT></I>, on the other hand, is a either-or word; one is either <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>not rich</FONT></I>; although one can be very <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I>, seldom is one spoken of as being moderately <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Rich</FONT></I>, unlike <I><FONT color=brown>wealthy</FONT></I>, is widely used in extended senses to mean full, pregnant or abundant: a <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I> find of rare minerals; a full, <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I> voice; an experience <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I> with meaning.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Well off</FONT></B>, as her considered, and <B><FONT color=blue>well-to-do</FONT></B> are closely synonymous terms often used in reference to persons who, while not necessarily <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I> or even <I><FONT color=brown>wealthy</FONT></I>, have sufficient money and possessions to be able to enjoy a standard of living considerably higher than average: A man would have to be pretty <I><FONT color=brown>well off</FONT></I> to afford a car like that; a <I><FONT color=brown>well-to-do</FONT></I> dentist who put his four sons through university.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Affluent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>opulent</FONT></B> are formal words derived from the Latin words meaning, respectively, to flow and power or wealth. <I><FONT color=brown>Affluent</FONT></I> thus suggests an abundant flow of goods or riches, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>opulent</FONT></I> has a strong connotation of ostentation or showy display of wealth: an <I><FONT color=brown>affluent</FONT></I> community where every family owned two cars; an <I><FONT color=brown>opulent</FONT></I> tapestry woven with gold and silver threads. <I><FONT color=brown>Opulent</FONT></I> most often refers to things, i.e., the products of wealth, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>affluent</FONT></I> describes people or human societies that possess wealth.</P><P>The less formal <B><FONT color=blue>flush</FONT></B> and the slang <B><FONT color=blue>loaded</FONT></B> mean having plenty of money, especially money on hand at a particular time. [<I><FONT color=brown>Flush</FONT></I> with his racecourse winnings, he went on a spending spree; We had just got paid so we were all <I><FONT color=brown>loaded</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Loaded</FONT></I> may also mean simply <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I>, in the sense of having a lot of money. Both these words differ from the others here considered in referring specifically to money, to the exclusion of other forms of wealth.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Prosperous</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>successful</FONT></B>, while implying the acquisition of wealth, do not indicate simply the possession of money and goods. <I><FONT color=brown>Prosperous</FONT></I> means thriving or flourishing, and suggests a temporary or developing state of affairs: a <I><FONT color=brown>prosperous</FONT></I> farmer; a <I><FONT color=brown>prosperous</FONT></I> period of industrial growth; a <I><FONT color=brown>prosperous</FONT></I> business community. A <I><FONT color=brown>prosperous</FONT></I> person or group need not be rich or even moderately <I><FONT color=brown>wealthy</FONT></I>, but only one whose economic situation is relatively good or on the rise: The vagrant felt himself <I><FONT color=brown>prosperous</FONT></I> when he found a dollar in the gutter. <I><FONT color=brown>Successful</FONT></I> goes one step farther in broadening the context to include wealth as just one facet of meaning. As here considered, <I><FONT color=brown>successful</FONT></I> combines the sense of <I><FONT color=brown>prosperous</FONT></I> with the fulfilment of certain goals or ambitions, independent of wealth, and thus connotes a greater degree of stability or permanence than <I><FONT color=brown>prosperous</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>successful</FONT></I> businessman, for instance, is one who has achieved prominence in his field, whereas a <I><FONT color=brown>prosperous</FONT></I> businessman is simply one who is doing well financially. Nevertheless, since success is often measured by one’s wealth, the role of wealth in determining what <I><FONT color=brown>successful</FONT></I> means is not to be minimized; it is hard to conceive of a <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I> man who will not be considered <I><FONT color=brown>successful</FONT></I> by most people, but it is not hard to imagine someone or something that is <I><FONT color=brown>successful</FONT></I> but not <I><FONT color=brown>rich</FONT></I>: a <I><FONT color=brown>successful</FONT></I> business in which his profit margin was small but reliable; A <I><FONT color=brown>successful</FONT></I> character actor for many years, he managed to live on his income by careful frugality.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Outstanding">OUTSTANDING</A>, <A href="entry://Prevalent">PREVALENT</A>.</P>

<P>These words all describe the inarticulate sounds and shedding of tears indicative of grief, pain or other strong emotions. <B><FONT color=blue>Weep</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cry</FONT></B> are close synonyms and are often used interchangeably. <I><FONT color=brown>Weep</FONT></I>, however, is more often used in writing than in speech, and gives greater emphasis to the sounds, although, paradoxically, it may describe also the act of silently shedding tears. [She <I><FONT color=brown>wept</FONT></I> copiously over the death of her dog; She <I><FONT color=brown>cried</FONT></I> loudly in despair; The child <I><FONT color=brown>cried</FONT></I> himself to sleep.] <I><FONT color=brown>Cry</FONT></I> does not always indicate depth of feeling; The baby <I><FONT color=brown>cried</FONT></I> loudly when he had emptied his bottle. Babies joy; to <I><FONT color=brown>weep</FONT></I> with joy; to <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I> with fright; to <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I> from exhaustion.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sob</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>whimper</FONT></B> describe different varieties of <I><FONT color=brown>weeping</FONT></I>. To <I><FONT color=brown>sob</FONT></I> is to <I><FONT color=brown>weep</FONT></I> with audible convulsive catches of breath and the heaving of one’s chest. <I><FONT color=brown>Sobbing</FONT></I> is usually accompanies by gaps and is akin to sighing. <I><FONT color=brown>Sob</FONT></I>, more than <I><FONT color=brown>weep</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I>, implies pathetic circumstances: The play ends with the heroine <I><FONT color=brown>sobbing</FONT></I> desperately as her lover resolutely walks away. To <I><FONT color=brown>whimper</FONT></I> is to <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I> or whine with plaintive broken sounds; <I><FONT color=brown>whimper</FONT></I> introduces the suggestion of defencelessness or timidity, and is most often associated with fright: a lost child <I><FONT color=brown>whimpering</FONT></I> for his mother. But the word can also criticize ill-humoured, unfounded or self-pitying complaints: those who <I><FONT color=brown>whimper</FONT></I> about high taxes.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Blubber</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wail</FONT></B> stress the sounds accompanying weeping. <I><FONT color=brown>Blubber</FONT></I> means to <I><FONT color=brown>weep</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>sob</FONT></I> noisily; the word reflects an attitude of ridicule or contempt on the part of the person using it, and is thus more abusive than descriptive, although in some contexts it may be used humorously to emphasize the inappropriate loudness of the weeping. [I just <I><FONT color=brown>blubber</FONT></I> like a baby when I see a sad film; A child your age shouldn’t sit about <I><FONT color=brown>blubbering</FONT></I> over a lost toy.] <I><FONT color=brown>Wail</FONT></I> suggests a loud, unbroken, usually high-pitched <I><FONT color=brown>cry</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Wailing</FONT></I> is traditionally associated with grief, and a <I><FONT color=brown>wail</FONT></I> is a formal cry of mourning. Nowadays, <I><FONT color=brown>wail</FONT></I> is most often used to describe any sad or melancholy sound, whether in grief or not. Otherwise it is used more informally, like <I><FONT color=brown>blubber</FONT></I>, as a term of contempt, implying a weak, self-pitying attitude: <I><FONT color=brown>wailing</FONT></I> as though he were dying every time he stubbed a toe.</P><P>All these terms are used also in the sense of conveying information while <I><FONT color=brown>weeping</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>crying</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>sobbing</FONT></I>, etc. ["I have no home to go to," she <I><FONT color=brown>wept</FONT></I>; He <I><FONT color=brown>blubbered</FONT></I> something about a package he’d lost.]</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Grieve">GRIEVE</A>, <A href="entry://Sad">SAD</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Laugh">LAUGH</A>, rejoice.</P>

<P>These verbs mean to cover, fill or permeate with water or other liquid. <B><FONT color=blue>Wet</FONT></B> is the most general word and may indicate all degrees of this condition. When not otherwise qualified, <I><FONT color=brown>wet</FONT></I> generally implies the agency of water. [<I><FONT color=brown>Wet</FONT></I> a corner of the facecloth; The girl <I><FONT color=brown>wet</FONT></I> her hair before setting it.] But any liquid can <I><FONT color=brown>wet</FONT></I>, and in a special sense the word refers to urination: The baby <I><FONT color=brown>wet</FONT></I> his nappy.</P><P>To <B><FONT color=blue>moisten</FONT></B> or <B><FONT color=blue>dampen</FONT></B> is to make or become somewhat <I><FONT color=brown>wet</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Moisten</FONT></I> stresses the act of wetting slightly: to <I><FONT color=brown>moisten</FONT></I> the lips with the tongue while speaking; to <I><FONT color=brown>moisten</FONT></I> a gummed label. <I><FONT color=brown>Dampen</FONT></I> emphasizes the moist condition that results: to <I><FONT color=brown>dampen</FONT></I> a shirt before ironing it. Both words may imply diffusion of moisture, but <I><FONT color=brown>moisten</FONT></I> more often indicates a localized wetting. [He <I><FONT color=brown>moistened</FONT></I> the soil round the plant; The morning dew <I><FONT color=brown>dampened</FONT></I> the ground.] In a figurative sense, <I><FONT color=brown>dampen</FONT></I> means depress: He was a wet blanket, <I><FONT color=brown>dampening</FONT></I> everyone’s spirits.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Soak</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>drench</FONT></B> mean to <I><FONT color=brown>wet</FONT></I> thoroughly. <I><FONT color=brown>Soak</FONT></I> often implies immersion. To <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I> something is to place it in liquid and leave it long enough for the liquid to act upon it: to <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I> dirty dishes in warm, soapy water to loosen the food particles; to <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I> a sprained ankle in Epsom-salt solution to lessen the swelling. <I><FONT color=brown>Drench</FONT></I>, on the other hand, typically involves the pouring down of liquid from above. It is a stronger word than <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I>, emphasizing the cause or instant effect of wetting where <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I> stresses the final result: <I><FONT color=brown>drenched</FONT></I> by a sudden downpour; <I><FONT color=brown>soaked</FONT></I> to the skin. When <I><FONT color=brown>drench</FONT></I>, like <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I>, involves immersion, it implies an excessive rather than a normal wetting: <I><FONT color=brown>soaking</FONT></I> in a warm bath; a guest in evening dress <I><FONT color=brown>drenched</FONT></I> and bedraggled by a dunking in the swimming pool. Both <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>drench</FONT></I> may mean to leave sopping <I><FONT color=brown>wet</FONT></I>: <I><FONT color=brown>drenched</FONT></I> with sweat; <I><FONT color=brown>soaking</FONT></I> wet with perspiration. But <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I> stresses permeation or absorption, a passing through the pores of something: Water <I><FONT color=brown>soaks</FONT></I> into the soil. <I><FONT color=brown>Drench</FONT></I> suggests that excess liquid is running off, not sinking in: <I><FONT color=brown>drenched</FONT></I> and dripping trees. In a figurative sense, <I><FONT color=brown>drench</FONT></I> suggests a flood of something spilling over everything like liquid ?drowning, saturating: a hill <I><FONT color=brown>drenched</FONT></I> with sunlight; a room <I><FONT color=brown>drenched</FONT></I> with colour. <I><FONT color=brown>Soak</FONT></I> focuses on absorption, meaning to take up eagerly or readily, as if by drinking in through the pores: to <I><FONT color=brown>soak up</FONT></I> knowledge like a sponge; a sunbather <I><FONT color=brown>soaking up</FONT></I> the sun.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Steep</FONT></B>, more strongly than <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I>, stresses immersion in a liquid and wetting for a purpose. One may <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I> or <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I> a thing to soften, saturate or cleanse it; but <I><FONT color=brown>steeping</FONT></I> may also have a more radical effect: to <I><FONT color=brown>soak</FONT></I> dried peas before cooking them; to <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I> barley in water until it starts to germinate. <I><FONT color=brown>Steeping</FONT></I> frequently involves the extraction of some constituent. [In the making of corn starch, kernels of corn are <I><FONT color=brown>steeped</FONT></I> in a weak solution of sulphur dioxide in order to loosen the hull and remove the germ containing to corn oil.] Specifically, in general use, <I><FONT color=brown>steeping</FONT></I> often indicates the extraction and <I><FONT color=brown>soaking</FONT></I> up of an essence: tea leaves <I><FONT color=brown>steeped</FONT></I> in boiling water. Figuratively, <I><FONT color=brown>steep</FONT></I> implies saturation through <I><FONT color=brown>soaking</FONT></I>, a making something part of the self, as if by total immersion in it: a scholar <I><FONT color=brown>steeped</FONT></I> in medieval lore; a child <I><FONT color=brown>steeped</FONT></I> in his parents?prejudice.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Filter">FILTER</A>, <A href="entry://Flood">FLOOD</A>, <A href="entry://Humid">HUMID</A>, <A href="entry://Leak">LEAK</A>, <A href="entry://Permeate">PERMEATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: dehumidify, dehydrate, desiccate, dry.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Whim</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>caprice</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>vagary</FONT></B> are all sudden and sometimes irrational notions, especially impulses to do something. A <I><FONT color=brown>whim</FONT></I> is a passing fancy or wish, often fantastic or odd. [On the first day of spring, the <I><FONT color=brown>whim</FONT></I> struck him to wear a huge rose in his lapel; Queen Elizabeth I, although an expert in statecraft, tended in private to indulge in foolish <I><FONT color=brown>whims</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Caprice</FONT></I>, stemming from the Latin word for goat, is a sudden change of mood, opinion or purpose without apparent motivation. As implied by its etymology, <I><FONT color=brown>caprice</FONT></I> suggests an insistence upon having one’s own way: a kindergarten teacher trying to control the <I><FONT color=brown>caprices</FONT></I> of a wilful little girl; a patient whose various <I><FONT color=brown>caprices</FONT></I> against obeying the doctor’s orders delayed his recovery. <I><FONT color=brown>Vagary</FONT></I> originally meant a journey or a rambling about and still suggests strongly unpredictable, erratic or even irresponsible behaviour: the <I><FONT color=brown>vagaries</FONT></I> of an employee who is always late and frequently lazy. It is a stronger term than either whim or <I><FONT color=brown>caprice</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Whim</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>vagary</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>caprice</FONT></I> may be used also in figurative senses: to sail at the <I><FONT color=brown>whim</FONT></I> of tide and wind; the <I><FONT color=brown>caprices</FONT></I> of fortune; the <I><FONT color=brown>vagaries</FONT></I> of spring weather.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>crotchet</FONT></B> is a perverse idea or opinion, about a particular subject, held obstinately despite its obvious untruth or contradiction to common opinion. [Mr. Midwick was well off, but his <I><FONT color=brown>crotchet</FONT></I> was that skimping on butter was a virtue.] <I><FONT color=brown>Crotchets</FONT></I> often concern minor points of doctrine or belief or merely trivial matter. [There is no <I><FONT color=brown>crotchet</FONT></I> so ridiculous, nor any idea so silly, that it cannot find acceptance somewhere.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Whimsy</FONT></B>, once considered a synonym of <B><FONT color=blue>whim</FONT></B>, is now applied almost exclusively to an odd, fanciful style of humour that delights and astonishes. <I><FONT color=brown>Whimsy</FONT></I> may appear in speech or actions, but is more likely to occur in literature: the <I><FONT color=brown>whimsy</FONT></I> of Lewis Carroll; the <I><FONT color=brown>whimsy</FONT></I> of The Wind in the Willows. <I><FONT color=brown>Whimsy</FONT></I> may range from charming fancy to tongue-in-cheek drollery.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eccentricity">ECCENTRICITY</A>, <A href="entry://Hope">HOPE</A>.</P>

<P>These words all describe more or less uncompromising or fixed states of mind. The differences between them reveal that obstinacy in itself can be adjudged wither good or bad, depending on the motive behind it and the uses to which it is put.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Wilful</FONT></B> means bent on having one’s own way, and therefore careless or indifferent of other people’s feelings or wishes. It has critical if not damning implications, but is somewhat mitigated by its common association with children: a <I><FONT color=brown>wilful</FONT></I> child, she insisted on wearing yellow socks with her maroon frock. When applied to adults it may be considered a sign of immaturity or unreasonable conceit: a <I><FONT color=brown>wilful</FONT></I> decision, taken without regard to the well-being of the community. <I><FONT color=brown>Strong-willed</FONT></I>, on the other hand, is usually taken to be complimentary, especially if the person indicated is a man: a <I><FONT color=brown>strong-willed</FONT></I> leader of men. It is also used to imply criticism less strong than wilful, perhaps mixed with a certain degree of admiration. [Robert is a very <I><FONT color=brown>strong-willed</FONT></I> person; once he has made up his mind, he won’t change it.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Firm</FONT></B> is decidedly favourable in tone. It means fixed and unshakable, and often implies deep commitment to a moral principle: a <I><FONT color=brown>firm</FONT></I> resolve to spend two hours each evening at study; a <I><FONT color=brown>firm</FONT></I> commitment to civil liberties. <I><FONT color=brown>Firm</FONT></I> is commonly used, also, as a euphemism for obstinate, because it substitutes the motive of high moral dedication for wilfulness or self-seeking; indeed, whether one calls someone <I><FONT color=brown>firm</FONT></I> or stigmatizes him with a less attractive adjective depends upon whether one happens to share his convictions. Politicians are famous for being <I><FONT color=brown>firm</FONT></I> (believers in democracy, supporters of the party, upholders of free enterprise, etc.). <B><FONT color=blue>Tenacious</FONT></B>, meaning tending to hold strongly, as opinions, nights etc., is also much favoured by men and women in the public eye: a <I><FONT color=brown>tenacious</FONT></I> defender of local-government rights. <I><FONT color=brown>Tenacious</FONT></I> has the implication of hanging on, refusing to let go no matter what the odds against eventual victory. This can be interpreted as blind stubbornness or as fierce devotion to right principle. Nevertheless, the word always conveys some respect; a <I><FONT color=brown>tenacious</FONT></I> adversary, for instance, may be disliked but he is certainly not to be taken lightly.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hard-headed</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>no-nonsense</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>tough</FONT></B> all describe practical, businesslike or ruthless attitudes. All are on the whole favourable in tone, since all suggest that the people so characterized are doers, people who care primarily about results rather than about the means by which they are achieved ?a attitude evidently highly valued by many Australians and New Zealanders. <I><FONT color=brown>Hard-headed</FONT></I> means having a shrewd and practical mind; a <I><FONT color=brown>hard-headed</FONT></I> businessman is not given to sentiment or to much thought about human feelings, although he is not necessarily unkind or inhuman. He simply regards such considerations as unimportant or boring, in any case not worth thinking about. <I><FONT color=brown>No-nonsense</FONT></I> means without time-consuming formalities or the rigmarole of polite intercourse, and indicates a straight, blunt, even gruff approach, with the aim of getting things done quickly and efficiently even at the price of wounding someone’s feelings or offending protocol. Though in its primary sense means capable of sustaining great tension or strain without breaking. If one thinks of emotional rather than physical tension or strain, one has an excellent definition of its common colloquial use applied to people who are deemed shrewd and canny, not easily fooled or worn down by argument: a <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I> negotiator; a <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I> competitor. <I><FONT color=brown>Tough</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>no-nonsense</FONT></I> often appear together in informal or self-consciously modern writing: a <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>no-nonsense</FONT></I> strongman of the Middle East; A <I><FONT color=brown>tough</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>no-nonsense</FONT></I> "take-charge" type was needed to head the campaign against road fatalities.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Imperturbable">IMPERTURBABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Stubborn">STUBBORN</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: accommodating, <A href="entry://Adaptable">ADAPTABLE</A>, <A href="entry://Compliant">COMPLIANT</A>, <A href="entry://Docile">DOCILE</A>, easy-going, NAÏVE, tender, <A href="entry://Timid">TIMID</A>, <A href="entry://Weak">WEAK</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Wind</FONT></B> and its synonyms are terms for natural movement of air. <B><FONT color=blue>Wind-storm</FONT></B> is a general term for movements of air that are so strong as to be a source of concern.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Breeze</FONT></B> is a general term for a light wind; it is also, as are some of the other words treated here, defined precisely by the Beaufor meteorological scale, which is used by the weather bureaus. The Beaufor scale defines a <I><FONT color=brown>breeze</FONT></I> as a wind having a velocity of between 4 and 31 miles an hour; <I><FONT color=brown>breezes</FONT></I> are further defined as "light" (4-7 miles per hour), "gentle" (8-12), "moderate" (13-18), "fresh" (19-24) and strong (25-31).</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Gale</FONT></B> is a general term for a very strong wind capable of doing considerable damage to property and usually regarded as hazardous for small craft at sea. The Beaufort scale defines <I><FONT color=brown>gale</FONT></I> as a wind having a velocity of between 32 and 63 miles an hour; gales are further defined as "moderate" (32-38 miles per hour), "fresh" (39-46), "strong" (47-54) and "whole" (55-63).</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Storm</FONT></B> is a general term for any atmospheric disturbance, especially one marked by a great whirling motion of the air and accompanied by rain, snow, hail, etc. the Beaufor scale defines a storm as a wind having a velocity of between 64 and 75 miles an hour, thus placing it between a "whole <I><FONT color=brown>gale</FONT></I>" and <B><FONT color=blue>hurricane</FONT></B>, which is defined as a <I><FONT color=brown>wind</FONT></I> having a velocity of over 75 miles an hour.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Whirlwind</FONT></B>, <B><FONT color=blue>tornado</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cyclone</FONT></B> denote <I><FONT color=brown>winds</FONT></I> that whirl helically round a central axis. Though <I><FONT color=brown>whirlwind</FONT></I> is the general name, this word is used chiefly as a synonym for <I><FONT color=brown>tornado</FONT></I>, an extremely violent vortex of small diameter. A <I><FONT color=brown>tornado</FONT></I> is a severe local storm (although not all severe local storms are <I><FONT color=brown>tornadoes</FONT></I>), and is sometimes visible as a funnel-shaped cloud of water vapour which moves in a relatively narrow path and can be devastating in its destructiveness. A <B><FONT color=blue>dust-devil</FONT></B> (or <B><FONT color=blue>willy willy</FONT></B>) is a well-developed dust <I><FONT color=brown>whirl</FONT></I>, usually of shorter duration and of smaller intensity than a <I><FONT color=brown>tornado</FONT></I>. Diminutive <I><FONT color=brown>dust-devils</FONT></I>, perhaps no higher than a house and spinning harmlessly across the ground for less than 100 yards before dissipating, are commonly seen in open outback areas of Australia. The local name <I><FONT color=brown>willy willy</FONT></I> originally applied to storms on the west coast of Australia but is now used only in reference to <I><FONT color=brown>dust-devils</FONT></I>.</P><P>Technically, a <I><FONT color=brown>cyclone</FONT></I> is a vortex of large dimensions. In meteorology the term is confined to phenomena at least hundreds of miles in diameter. The winds of a <I><FONT color=brown>cyclone</FONT></I> spiral clockwise round an area of low barometric pressure in the southern hemisphere and anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere. The more intense type of <I><FONT color=brown>cyclone</FONT></I> may, if the wind velocity exceeds 75 miles per hour, be called a <I><FONT color=brown>hurricane</FONT></I>, although the term is not in universal usage. Generally speaking, <I><FONT color=brown>hurricane</FONT></I> is restricted to intense <I><FONT color=brown>cyclones</FONT></I> occurring in the south-western Atlantic area, the Caribbean Sea and on the west coast of Mexico. Such a <I><FONT color=brown>cyclone</FONT></I> is known in the North and South-West Pacific as a typhoon and in the Australian and Indian Ocean regions as a tropical <I><FONT color=brown>cyclone</FONT></I>.</P><P>A <B><FONT color=blue>squall</FONT></B> is a sudden and violent wind of short duration, and is often accompanied by rain or snow. The word is perhaps most commonly used to describe <I><FONT color=brown>storms</FONT></I> at sea. A <B><FONT color=blue>blizzard</FONT></B> is a high, cold wind accompanied by blinding snow that accumulates to a considerable depth. <B><FONT color=blue>Tempest</FONT></B>, nowadays a somewhat poetic term, can be applied to any <I><FONT color=brown>storm</FONT></I> of great violence, especially one involving both <I><FONT color=brown>wind</FONT></I> and rain, snow or hail.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Flood">FLOOD</A>.</P>

<P>These words are comparable in denoting mental qualities that have to do with the ability to understand situations, anticipate consequences and make sound decisions. <B><FONT color=blue>Wisdom</FONT></B> is a broad term, embracing the meaning of all its synonyms in addition to outranking them all in suggesting a are combination of discretion, maturity, keenness of intellect, broad experience, extensive learning, profound thought and compassionate understanding. In its full application, <I><FONT color=brown>wisdom</FONT></I> implies the highest and noblest exercise of all the faculties of the moral nature as well as of the intellect: A great jurist bases his decisions on a <I><FONT color=brown>wisdom</FONT></I> gained from far more than his study of the law.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Sense</FONT></B> also is very general in meaning. It can refer to rational perception accompanied by feeling. Used this way, it suggests an intense awareness and realization of the stimuli to which it is responding: a highly developed <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> of right and wrong. The word is commonly applied to the ability to act effectively in any given situation. It is very close in this meaning to <B><FONT color=blue>sagacity</FONT></B>, both terms suggesting the kind of knowledge or know-how which is the result of broad experience and the thoughtful evaluation of such experience: a politician who showed good <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> in avoiding the mistakes he’d made in a previous campaign; a <I><FONT color=brown>sagacity</FONT></I> that was reflected in all his business dealings. But <I><FONT color=brown>sagacity</FONT></I> is more formal and can suggest also a searching profundity, like <I><FONT color=brown>wisdom</FONT></I>: the old man’s <I><FONT color=brown>sagacity</FONT></I> about the dilemmas of life.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Discernment</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>discrimination</FONT></B> are alike in denoting an analytic ability that allows one to see things clearly. <I><FONT color=brown>Discernment</FONT></I> is applied to the evaluation of character and is concerned with the kind of accuracy of observation that finds the real behind the apparent: With <I><FONT color=brown>discernment</FONT></I> a personnel manager can screen job applicants so as to eliminate bluffers and secure properly qualified and conscientious staff for his firm. In another meaning, <I><FONT color=brown>discernment</FONT></I> can refer to making distinctions; in this usage it suggests the power to recognize quality or worth, as in a work of art: a music critic whose <I><FONT color=brown>discernment</FONT></I> of great talent has been proved time and time again. <I><FONT color=brown>Discrimination</FONT></I> is very closely allied to the second meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>discernment</FONT></I>, denoting an ability to perceive very subtle distinctions, even when they might be blurred to ordinary observation: a chef with such gustatory <I><FONT color=brown>discrimination</FONT></I> that he could recognize any seasoning, no matter how delicate, that had been used in the preparation of a meal.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Judgement</FONT></B> is <I><FONT color=brown>sense</FONT></I> applied to the making of decisions, especially correct decisions, and thus it depends to some degree upon the exercise of discernment or discrimination: the dangerous fallibility of a man with a good heart and poor judgement.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Acumen">ACUMEN</A>, <A href="entry://Discriminate">DISCRIMINATE</A>, <A href="entry://Keen">KEEN</A>, <A href="entry://Observant">OBSERVANT</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: folly, foolishness, imprudence, indiscretion, miscalculation, mis-judgement, senselessness, silliness, stupidity.</P>

<P>These words refer to an introspective frame of mind that is sad, thoughtful or intense. <B><FONT color=blue>Wistful</FONT></B> stresses sadness that is mild and bittersweet, often suggesting a light, wishful longing after something past or impossible: a <I><FONT color=brown>wistful</FONT></I> hour spent remembering her childhood dream of becoming a great writer; giving his friend’s wife a <I><FONT color=brown>wistful</FONT></I> look. Sometimes, the word suggests an aura of not unpleasant sadness that is not attached to any specific aspiration: feeling tipsy and <I><FONT color=brown>wistful</FONT></I> as the last guests left the party. <B><FONT color=blue>Nostalgic</FONT></B> specifically applies to a longing for familiar or beloved circumstances that are now remote or irrecoverable. <I><FONT color=brown>Nostalgic</FONT></I> thoughts focus on events or people that actually happened or lived, whereas wistful thoughts may centre on far-fetched hopes of past illusions. A <I><FONT color=brown>wistful</FONT></I> feeling may be casual or fleeting, but a <I><FONT color=brown>nostalgic</FONT></I> feeling is usually deeply felt and is often suggestive of a mood lasting some time. [She opened the photograph album whenever she was in a <I><FONT color=brown>nostalgic</FONT></I> mood; <I><FONT color=brown>nostalgic</FONT></I> memories of boyhood street games whenever he passed through a lower-class neighbourhood.] <I><FONT color=brown>Nostalgic</FONT></I> suggests both satisfaction and regret, usually implying a warmth and intensity of feeling lacking in <I><FONT color=brown>wistful</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Plaintive</FONT></B> may stress any sort of longing, sorrow or wish expressed in words or song: a <I><FONT color=brown>plaintive</FONT></I> request that he ring her up some time: a <I><FONT color=brown>plaintive</FONT></I> melody. But, as now used, the word has drawn closer to <I><FONT color=brown>wistful</FONT></I> in not necessarily indicating utterance at all: looking after him with a <I><FONT color=brown>plaintive</FONT></I> smile. The emotion suggested here is a shade more intense than that of <I><FONT color=brown>wistful</FONT></I>, with a possible suggestion both of greater hopelessness and greater need or desire: the <I><FONT color=brown>plaintive</FONT></I> cry of a kitten which had become separated from the rest of the litter.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Pensive</FONT></B>, strictly speaking, can refer solely to a musing, reflective thoughtfulness: <I><FONT color=brown>pensive</FONT></I> chess-players bent over the board. Very often the word is felt to imply a state of mind that is also tinged with sadness or resignation: feeling <I><FONT color=brown>pensive</FONT></I> and lonely as he watched the boat fading away in the distance. The notion of musing or thoughtful, without any suggestion of sadness, is expressed in dreamy: Pay attention and don’t be so dreamy. Moody, by contrast, can refer to a wide variety of emotions, including sadness, sullennes or anger. Most typically, it might suggest any dark, depressed and withdrawn state of mind, one considerably more intense than would be true for other words here: He would slouch about for days in a moody silence. The word often implies a petulant or uncertain disposition: a moody, sulky child.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Considerate">CONSIDERATE</A>, <A href="entry://Imagination">IMAGINATION</A>, <A href="entry://Sad">SAD</A>, <A href="entry://Sentimental">SENTIMENTAL</A>, <A href="entry://Think">THINK</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: airy, <A href="entry://Flippant">FLIPPANT</A>, <A href="entry://Heedless">HEEDLESS</A>.</P>

<B><FONT color=blue><P>Wording</FONT></B> refers to the particular words a person uses in speech or writing and to the manner in which he uses them: The <I><FONT color=brown>wording</FONT></I> of the proposition is simple and direct. <B><FONT color=blue>Verbiage</FONT></B> is sometimes used as a synonym for wording, but more often it designates an excess of words in proportion to the ideas which they express: The author’s <I><FONT color=brown>verbiage</FONT></I> produced a document of mammoth size and microscopic import. <B><FONT color=blue>Language</FONT></B>, in one sense, denotes all sounds spoken and combined into words and sentences that human beings use for the communication of ideas or emotions. In a more limited sense, <I><FONT color=brown>language</FONT></I> refers to those words and combinations that have been systematized and confirmed by usage among members of a certain nation, people or race at a given period: the French <I><FONT color=brown>language</FONT></I>. In its widest sense, <I><FONT color=brown>language</FONT></I> signifies expression of thought by any means: the <I><FONT color=brown>language</FONT></I> of the eyes; the <I><FONT color=brown>language</FONT></I> of flowers. The word or expressions used in a specific business, science, etc., also are referred to as <I><FONT color=brown>language</FONT></I>: the <I><FONT color=brown>language</FONT></I> of mathematics. <B><FONT color=blue>Vocabulary</FONT></B> is the sum of words used or understood by a certain person, making up a particular language, or employed in some specific business, science, etc.: the immeasurable contribution of Greek to the English <I><FONT color=brown>vocabulary</FONT></I>; a lawyer’s <I><FONT color=brown>vocabulary</FONT></I>. It refers, by extension, to a person’s preference in the area of language: Hardy’s <I><FONT color=brown>vocabulary</FONT></I> was largely Anglo-Saxon. <B><FONT color=blue>Wordage</FONT></B> is a formal and not widely used term meaning words collectively. But <I><FONT color=brown>wordage</FONT></I> can refer to the amount of words allotted for or taken up by a piece of writing, such as a newspaper article: an analysis that was inevitably superficial, considering the compressed <I><FONT color=brown>wordage</FONT></I> he was permitted.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Conversation">CONVERSATION</A>, SAY <A href="entry://Speech">SPEECH</A>, <A href="entry://Write">WRITE</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to what is useful, sensible, suitable or capable of being realized. In its most restricted application to an idea or proposal, <B><FONT color=blue>workable</FONT></B> indicates simply that something can be carried out in reality: a committee that presented several <I><FONT color=brown>workable</FONT></I> plans, though it didn’t claim to know which of them would be most effective. The word can include in its meaning a proposal’s likelihood of being effective as well: While both plans were perfectly sensible, only one seemed <I><FONT color=brown>workable</FONT></I> in terms of actually reducing delinquency. The word can apply also to methods, plans or systems already under way, in which case it refers strictly to proven ability to accomplish set goals effectively: many employee suggestions that proved to be <I><FONT color=brown>workable</FONT></I> once they were adopted. <B><FONT color=blue>Possible</FONT></B>, while very general and wide-ranging in application, is restricted in this context to the most limited meaning of <I><FONT color=brown>workable</FONT></I>, suggesting something that can actually be carried out given the right conditions: the pair who first proved that it was <I><FONT color=brown>possible</FONT></I> for man to fly. But the word can point merely to the chance that something may occur or to whatever is not ruled out as an eventuality by the nature of reality: vaguely <I><FONT color=brown>possible</FONT></I> that he could still win the election.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Feasible</FONT></B> is more formal than the foregoing, but is otherwise like <I><FONT color=brown>workable</FONT></I> in pointing either to something’s capability of being realized or to its success, once carried out. It is distinct from <I><FONT color=brown>workable</FONT></I> in that the latter views effective operation as if in a vacuum, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>feasible</FONT></I> may suggest a variety of impinging external factors that qualify performance; a design, for example, may prove <I><FONT color=brown>workable</FONT></I> under ideal conditions and yet not be <I><FONT color=brown>feasible</FONT></I> for ordinary use.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Practicable</FONT></B> is the most restricted of these words in meaning. It compares to <I><FONT color=brown>possible</FONT></I> in pointing solely to proposals that can be realized, but is more restricted in that it eliminates notions of mere occurrence or likelihood, and concentrates instead on what can be produced, created, built or put into effect. It compares naturally with and complements <B><FONT color=blue>practical</FONT></B>, which points mainly to something of proven effectiveness. Thus this pair relate like workable and feasible, but with a much more clear-cut set of distinctions in meaning. While there would be a <I><FONT color=brown>practical</FONT></I> use for a robot that could, for example, clean the house on command, the manufacture of such a device is not yet <I><FONT color=brown>practicable</FONT></I>. It is <I><FONT color=brown>practicable</FONT></I> to make gramophone records three feet in diameter, but the user would not find them convenient or <I><FONT color=brown>practical</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Sensible">SENSIBLE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Doubtful">DOUBTFUL</A>, impracticable, impractical, impossible, unlikely, unworkable.</P>

<P>These verbs pertain most strictly to external physical injury, though all of them are used widely for other sorts of damage. <B><FONT color=blue>Wound</FONT></B> most often indicates a relatively serious external breaching of the flesh, possibly by a piercing or gouging action, one that may go deep: <I><FONT color=brown>wounded</FONT></I> in the fall, but escaping permanent injury; <I><FONT color=brown>wounded</FONT></I> by machine-gun fire. Often the word is used, particularly in military contexts, to contrast the injured and the dead: ten soldiers killed and two <I><FONT color=brown>wounded</FONT></I>. The word refers also to emotional injury, whether serious or trivial: <I><FONT color=brown>wounded</FONT></I> by her sharp retort.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Cut</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>lacerate</FONT></B> are both restricted to specific kinds of <I><FONT color=brown>wounding</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Cut</FONT></I> suggests the stabbing or slashing action of a sharp instrument. Whereas <I><FONT color=brown>wound</FONT></I> may suggest a cleavage or gash, cut suggests a slit like opening, whether shallow or deep: <I><FONT color=brown>cutting</FONT></I> her finger by accident with the vegetable knife. More generally, <I><FONT color=brown>cut</FONT></I> may suggest any severing or paring action: <I><FONT color=brown>cutting</FONT></I> off the gangrenous limb; <I><FONT color=brown>cutting</FONT></I> the paper in two. <I><FONT color=brown>Lacerate</FONT></I> is more restricted, like <I><FONT color=brown>wound</FONT></I>, to bodily injury, but it specifically suggests a jagged <I><FONT color=brown>cutting</FONT></I> or the making of a group of <I><FONT color=brown>cuts</FONT></I>, as by an abrading action: <I><FONT color=brown>lacerating</FONT></I> his hand on an open jam tin; <I><FONT color=brown>lacerated</FONT></I> by the road surface as he was dragged helplessly along by the speeding car. In metaphorical uses, the word suggests a savage or vehement <I><FONT color=brown>wounding</FONT></I>: an acerbic view that <I><FONT color=brown>lacerated</FONT></I> the author.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Bruise</FONT></B> is distinct from the other words in indicating an injury of the surface flesh, caused by a blow that does not necessarily break the skin and that typically results in a black-and-blue swelling of the affected area: <I><FONT color=brown>bruising</FONT></I> himself by kicking a chair in the dark. The word can suggest also the tendency to turn black-and-blue from small impacts, as in the quip, "I <I><FONT color=brown>bruise</FONT></I> easily."</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Scar</FONT></B>, most strictly, refers to the forming of a mark over a healed <I><FONT color=brown>wound</FONT></I>: permanently <I><FONT color=brown>scarred</FONT></I> by the acid thrown in his face. Sometimes the word is used less precisely as a harsher, more emphatic substitute for cut or <I><FONT color=brown>lacerate</FONT></I>: instantly <I><FONT color=brown>scarred</FONT></I> by the breaking pane of glass. Used of the emotions, the word suggests the doing of damage that will leave a lasting mark: <I><FONT color=brown>scarred</FONT></I> by the constant hostility of his father.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Disfigure">DISFIGURE</A>, <A href="entry://Hurt">HURT</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer to convulsed or contorted movements within a body. <B><FONT color=blue>Wriggle</FONT></B> can suggest a deliberate shaking or shuddering not intended to result in motion along a path: <I><FONT color=brown>wriggling</FONT></I> uncomfortably in his wet clothes; <I><FONT color=brown>wriggling</FONT></I> with delight as the waves broke over her. More often, the word does suggest forward movement achieved by a crawling or creeping action: <I><FONT color=brown>wriggling</FONT></I> into the tunnel with a torch in one hand; a caterpillar that <I><FONT color=brown>wriggled</FONT></I> down the girl’s back. <B><FONT color=blue>Slither</FONT></B> points exclusively to this sort of movement, but, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>wriggle</FONT></I> may suggest jerking, awkward or ungainly motion, slither implies a sinuous and graceful sliding of an elongated body, such as that of a snake: pythons <I><FONT color=brown>slithering</FONT></I> noiselessly over a rock; a rope that <I><FONT color=brown>slithered</FONT></I> unseen down the prison wall.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Squirm</FONT></B> is nearly identical to <I><FONT color=brown>wriggle</FONT></I> in suggesting either in-place shaking or a forward crawl. In both cases, a greater amount of internal undulation is suggested by <I><FONT color=brown>squirm</FONT></I>, as well as more thrashing about: watching the stranded octopus <I><FONT color=brown>squirm</FONT></I> each time they stabbed at it; trying desperately to <I><FONT color=brown>squirm</FONT></I> free from the tangled bedclothes. In contrast to the foregoing words, both <B><FONT color=blue>writhe</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>wiggle</FONT></B> point primarily to in-place motion. <I><FONT color=brown>Writhe</FONT></I> would suggest a slower, less voluntary shuddering than <I><FONT color=brown>squirm</FONT></I> and even <I><FONT color=brown>wriggle</FONT></I>; it often describes the throes of someone in pain: bodies writhing in agony. But the word can suggest other kinds of contorted movement as well: <I><FONT color=brown>writhing</FONT></I> teenagers dancing the frug. <I><FONT color=brown>Wiggle</FONT></I> suggests a side-to-side or back-and-forth motion: proving to them that he could <I><FONT color=brown>wiggle</FONT></I> his ears; the woman who seemed unaware of how much she <I><FONT color=brown>wiggled</FONT></I> as she walked. As in the last example, if forward movement is indicated, the word points to incidental motion rather than to motion that contributes directly to the gaining of ground.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Bend">BEND</A>, <A href="entry://Rotate">ROTATE</A>, <A href="entry://Shake">SHAKE</A>, <A href="entry://Vibrate">VIBRATE</A>.</P>

<P>To <B><FONT color=blue>write</FONT></B> is to make, form or trace letters, numbers, words, etc., as with a pencil or pen. In this basic sense <I><FONT color=brown>write</FONT></I> is the most general of the words being compared here and can be used as a synonyms for any of them. <I><FONT color=brown>Write</FONT></I>, of course, has many more applications than the other terms because of its variety of specialized meanings, all of which are extensions of the basic sense. <I><FONT color=brown>Write</FONT></I> can mean to describe, communicate by letter, be the author of, and draw up or draft: to <I><FONT color=brown>write</FONT></I> one’s impression of an art show; forced to <I><FONT color=brown>write</FONT></I> from Europe to ask her family for money; a famous statesman who has <I><FONT color=brown>written</FONT></I> his autobiography; the lawyer who <I><FONT color=brown>wrote</FONT></I> my will.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Inscribe</FONT></B> suggests <I><FONT color=brown>writing</FONT></I> for some solemn or official purpose. It can refer to the putting down of a person’s name in a formal list or register: to <I><FONT color=brown>inscribe</FONT></I> a student’s name on his school’s permanent honour roll. It can denote the marking or engraving of words, characters, names, etc., as part of conspicuous or permanent record: to <I><FONT color=brown>inscribe</FONT></I> a name on a public monument; to <I><FONT color=brown>inscribe</FONT></I> a ring with a personal message. It can designate also the signing or dedication of a book, photograph, etc.: to <I><FONT color=brown>inscribe</FONT></I> a volume of poetry to an old friend. To <I><FONT color=brown>write</FONT></I> something brief and do it in a hasty way is to <B><FONT color=blue>jot</FONT></B>. There are suggestions of a lack of forethought or preparation about this word: to <I><FONT color=brown>jot</FONT></I> down an idea on the back of an envelope; a telephone number <I><FONT color=brown>jotted</FONT></I> down on a matchbook cover. <B><FONT color=blue>Pen</FONT></B> means to <I><FONT color=brown>write</FONT></I> with a pen: to <I><FONT color=brown>pen</FONT></I> a letter to a friend. By extension it means to <I><FONT color=brown>write</FONT></I> in any way, but it often has connotations of composing with great care and thought: the enormous difficulties involved in <I><FONT color=brown>penning</FONT></I> a really fine short story. The word now has a formal, old-fashioned tone that may appear stuffy or pretentiously quaint in some contexts. <B><FONT color=blue>Scribble</FONT></B> is like <I><FONT color=brown>jot</FONT></I> in its implication of <I><FONT color=brown>writing</FONT></I> with haste and a lack of care: two young schoolgirls scribbling notes to each other during class. <I><FONT color=brown>Scribble</FONT></I> refers also to the making of illegible or meaningless marks: The two-year-old laughed happily after having <I><FONT color=brown>scribbled</FONT></I> all over the walls with his mother’s lipstick.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Say">SAY</A>.</P>

<P>These words refer unflatteringly to rural, provincial, uncultured or unsophisticated people. <B><FONT color=blue>Yokel</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>hayseed</FONT></B> are contemptuous informal terms for a person from a rural or farming background who is uncultured or ignorant. <I><FONT color=brown>Hayseed</FONT></I> is not common but when used is the more vivid and the more withering in its scorn: stuck off-season in a holiday resort filled with country <I><FONT color=brown>yokels</FONT></I>; a <I><FONT color=brown>hayseed</FONT></I> who didn’t seem able to understand the simplest request for directions. Also, <I><FONT color=brown>yokel</FONT></I> can refer to any non-cosmopolitan audience: taking a programme of hackneyed piano pieces on tour, since they were sure to please the local <I><FONT color=brown>yokels</FONT></I>. Both terms seem old-fashioned today; they have the ring of a bygone era, probably because of the greatly increasing sophistication of rural people.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Hick</FONT></B>, too, can apply to someone in a provincial setting, including those from towns or even cities considered to be removed from the centre of things: attacking him for sneering at so-called <I><FONT color=brown>hicks</FONT></I> in Armidale and Albury who wanted to build their own cultural centres rather than depending on touring companies from Sydney or Melbourne. Where <I><FONT color=brown>yokel</FONT></I> and hayseed usually place the provincial person in his home town, <I><FONT color=brown>hick</FONT></I> can apply to someone who appears to be newly arrived in a cosmopolitan setting and is still unfamiliar with its ways: <I><FONT color=brown>hicks</FONT></I> who come to King’s Cross to look at the hippies.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Country bumpkin</FONT></B>, another old-fashioned abusive term for a person from a rural area, was originally slang for one who could be easily gulled, duped or conned: <I><FONT color=brown>country bumpkins</FONT></I> who fell for the sideshow barker’s promise of fantastic delights inside the tent. <B><FONT color=blue>Rustic</FONT></B> is the most formal of these words ?and the least uncomplimentary as well. It suggests a colourful, possibly even likeable country eccentric who is set in his ways or appears to be quaint in his tastes: sketching the old <I><FONT color=brown>rustic</FONT></I> who sat fishing on the jetty. While all these words, by implication, indicate men, <I><FONT color=brown>hick</FONT></I> and possibly <I><FONT color=brown>rustic</FONT></I> may refer to both men and women when pluralized: the dumb <I><FONT color=brown>hicks</FONT></I> in that town; a quaint English village peopled by genuine <I><FONT color=brown>rustics</FONT></I>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Blockhead">BLOCKHEAD</A>.</P>

<P>These, words denote young people of the ages between childhood and maturity. <B><FONT color=blue>Youth</FONT></B>, now a rather old-fashioned word, is applied to young males almost exclusively, especially those in their teens or early twenties: a callow <I><FONT color=brown>youth</FONT></I>; to go to sea as a <I><FONT color=brown>youth</FONT></I>. As a collective, <I><FONT color=brown>youth</FONT></I> denotes young persons as a group, both male and female: the <I><FONT color=brown>youth</FONT></I> of a nation; the flower of our country’s <I><FONT color=brown>youth</FONT></I> died at Gallipoli.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Adolescent</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>teenager</FONT></B> both designate a person from the age of 13 to 19. <I><FONT color=brown>Adolescent</FONT></I> is a more formal term than <I><FONT color=brown>teenager</FONT></I> and may simply to be used in the chronological sense: a course in safe driving for <I><FONT color=brown>adolescents</FONT></I>; to have three <I><FONT color=brown>adolescent</FONT></I> daughters. In an extended sense, <I><FONT color=brown>adolescent</FONT></I> connotes the awkwardness, the rapid growth and the emotional upheavals of this period of life. When used of an adult of any age, <I><FONT color=brown>adolescent</FONT></I> is a disparaging term and emphasizes immaturity in behaviour or thinking. <I><FONT color=brown>Teenager</FONT></I> has gained wide acceptance since World War II, especially as points to the period approaching young adulthood, <I><FONT color=brown>teenager</FONT></I> emphasizes an age group which more and more deliberately sets itself apart from the adult world and which has its own standards of conduct, its own fashions, its own entertainments and even its own argot.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Young man</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>young woman</FONT></B> tend to be relative terms, since their use sometimes depends upon the age of the person who says or writes them.

In a playful or scolding way, <I><FONT color=brown>young man</FONT></I> is frequently used in addressing small boys: <I><FONT color=brown>young man</FONT></I>, wash those dirty hands.

<P>These words come into comparison as verbal equivalents of the symbol for nothing, 0. The choice of which one to use depends upon a context that may range from the archaic and informal to the mathematical and scientific.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Zero</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>cipher</FONT></B> both come from the Arabic word <I><FONT color=brown>sifr</FONT></I>, meaning empty. In this sense <I><FONT color=brown>zero</FONT></I> has come to be the most commonly used to indicate the absence or negation of something. [Subtracting any number from itself gives <I><FONT color=brown>zero</FONT></I>; The results of all the tests were <I><FONT color=brown>zero</FONT></I>.] It is also regarded as the standard reference point in any scale of values, quantities, magnitudes, dimensions, etc. [The temperature was 10 below (or above) <I><FONT color=brown>zero</FONT></I>; The gambler bet on <I><FONT color=brown>zero</FONT></I> at roulette; Heavy fog reduced visibility to <I><FONT color=brown>zero</FONT></I>.] <I><FONT color=brown>Cipher</FONT></I>, though literally synonymous, cannot replace <I><FONT color=brown>zero</FONT></I> in any of the above examples. It is still thought of as representing any numeral from 0 to 9, a use carried over from the verb form meaning to count or calculate. We can, of course, increase the value of any whole number by adding ciphers at the end of it, but the distinction is recognized by saying that the enlarged number, say 643,000, contains three <I><FONT color=brown>zeros</FONT></I>, not <I><FONT color=brown>ciphers</FONT></I>. Nevertheless, the idea of nullity or nonentity is usually clear from the context, especially if we are using the word in a figurative sense: man is a mere <I><FONT color=brown>cipher</FONT></I> in the universe.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Naught</FONT></B> (sometimes spelt <B><FONT color=blue>nought</FONT></B>), an Old English word for nothing, doubles for <I><FONT color=brown>cipher</FONT></I> in its literal sense, [This number has a lot of <I><FONT color=brown>noughts</FONT></I> in it; Let’s play <I><FONT color=brown>noughts</FONT></I> and crosses.] But this use is mostly colloquial, though less so than the clipped version <B><FONT color=blue>aught</FONT></B> (a <I><FONT color=brown>naught</FONT></I> taken as an <I><FONT color=brown>aught</FONT></I>). As an epithet for a person or thing devoid of merit or value, naught still has poetic force. [All his plans came to <I><FONT color=brown>naught</FONT></I>; There was <I><FONT color=brown>naught</FONT></I> to be done in the emergency but wait.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Nil</FONT></B> is very common for nothing, especially in relation to scoring: we won three sets to <I><FONT color=brown>nil</FONT></I>. It still has considerable general application: All our efforts were <I><FONT color=brown>nil</FONT></I> against his greater experience. <B><FONT color=blue>Null</FONT></B> is best known to us in the duplicated legal phrase "<I><FONT color=brown>null</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>void</FONT></I>," meaning without force or effect, or invalid. But it also serves a useful purpose to indicate a negative result or outcome, especially in certain types of scientific work.

<P>These words all denote states or attitudes of keen enjoyment, invigoration or vitality. <B><FONT color=blue>Zest</FONT></B> expresses dynamic vigour together with uninhabited sensuous delight: The remarkable aspect of the life of Don Juan was not the number of women he seduced but the <I><FONT color=brown>zest</FONT></I> with which he seduced them. In some contexts <B><FONT color=blue>gusto</FONT></B> and <I><FONT color=brown>zest</FONT></I> are interchangeable: He ate with <I><FONT color=brown>zest</FONT></I> (or <I><FONT color=brown>gusto</FONT></I>). But <I><FONT color=brown>gusto</FONT></I>, while intensely felt, is commonly associated with single events of short duration, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>zest</FONT></I> may signal a more profound or enduring characteristic. [After his illness he lost his <I><FONT color=brown>zest</FONT></I> for life; They traded insults with <I><FONT color=brown>gusto</FONT></I>.]</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Energy</FONT></B> emphasizes the vigour of physical action rather than a dynamic motivation. To eat with <I><FONT color=brown>energy</FONT></I>, for instance, suggests nothing more than the expenditure of a good deal of effort in hastily transferring food from plate to mouth, whereas eating with <I><FONT color=brown>zest</FONT></I> or with <I><FONT color=brown>gusto</FONT></I> expresses keen appreciation of the food. <I><FONT color=brown>Energy</FONT></I> is often used as an enduring quality: A man of <I><FONT color=brown>energy</FONT></I>, he took a brisk stroll every morning before breakfast.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Drive</FONT></B> is an informal word used to denote <I><FONT color=brown>energy</FONT></I> stimulated by ambition: he has lots of <I><FONT color=brown>drive</FONT></I> to get ahead in his work. This use of <I><FONT color=brown>drive</FONT></I> may have been influenced by the word’s psychological meaning of a strong, motivating power or stimulus: The sex <I><FONT color=brown>drive</FONT></I>.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Zip</FONT></B> is an onomatopoeic word derived from the sharp sound of a bullet passing through air or the sudden tearing of cloth, and suggests energy, get-up-and-go, vitality: He has plenty of <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I>; a song that has <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I>. In the United States <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I> had a revival of use with the adoption by the U.S. Post Office of the acronym <I><FONT color=brown>ZIP</FONT></I> (Zone Improvement Plan), a post-code system to speed mail deliveries. Used as a verb, <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I> denotes going at great speed: jets that <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I> across the Pacific. <B><FONT color=blue>Pep</FONT></B> is virtually synonymous with <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I>, but has an overtone of spicy, stimulating vigour: she sings with lots of <I><FONT color=brown>pep</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Pep</FONT></I> is used also with "<I><FONT color=brown>pill</FONT></I>" to denote a medication that may create a sensation of vigour: He took a <I><FONT color=brown>pep-pill</FONT></I> to help him stay awake. No doubt there will always be new, ephemeral, attractive-sounding words meaning the same as <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I>. One of these could be <I><FONT color=brown>zing</FONT></I>, which is enjoying considerable popularity, and in America a new fad word replacing <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I> in many contexts is <I><FONT color=brown>pizazz</FONT></I> (also spelt <I><FONT color=brown>pizzazz</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>pzzazz</FONT></I>, <I><FONT color=brown>pazazz</FONT></I>, and may other ways). The best current translation seems to be "that extra something" ?an unnameable quality that invests someone or something with <I><FONT color=brown>zip</FONT></I>, vitality and irresistible appeal. As one might have guessed, the word, like so many other slang expressions, has been adopted by advertising and fashion writers because of its attraction to young buyers: a miniskirt with <I><FONT color=brown>pizazz</FONT></I>! When applied to people <I><FONT color=brown>pizazz</FONT></I> means something like grace and distinction. [The crowds gape wherever he goes; he has, an a word, <I><FONT color=brown>pizazz</FONT></I>.] But fad words change so rapidly that it would be foolhardy to predict what this word will mean in one year or five years from now, or whether it will still be used at all.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Brio</FONT></B>, meaning spirit, suggests exuberant, often careless, vitality. [He spoke with tremendous <I><FONT color=brown>brio</FONT></I>; his speech, always loud no matter where he was, was punctuated with brilliant but unrepeatable oaths and cheerful slanders, and his gestures were appropriately flamboyant.] As a musical direction, <I><FONT color=brown>con brio</FONT></I> means with spirit, in a lively manner.</P><B><FONT color=blue><P>Dash</FONT></B> and <B><FONT color=blue>verve</FONT></B> both emphasize a great and vigorous <I><FONT color=brown>energy</FONT></I>, but <I><FONT color=brown>dash</FONT></I> points more particularly to a brilliant or flamboyant style carried out with sophistication and speed, whereas <I><FONT color=brown>verve</FONT></I> stresses the enthusiasm and untiring nature of the effort. [Ethel Merman sings with <I><FONT color=brown>verve</FONT></I>; He toasted our health with exquisite courtesy and entertained us with considerable <I><FONT color=brown>dash</FONT></I>.] <B><FONT color=blue>Panache</FONT></B> is derived from the Latin word for feather, and its literal meaning is a plume or bunch of feathers, especially when worn as an ornament on a helmet. Panache, in its more common sense, is thus a wit or brilliance of style with which something is done or said: the aristocratic jewel thief who pulls of his jobs with elegance and <I><FONT color=brown>panache</FONT></I>. <I><FONT color=brown>Dash</FONT></I> and <I><FONT color=brown>panache</FONT></I> both suggest an elegant independence of spirit amounting to an indifference to or contempt for popular manners or morals.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>SEE</FONT></STRONG>: <A href="entry://Eager">EAGER</A>, <A href="entry://Lively">LIVELY</A>, <A href="entry://Passionate">PASSIONATE</A>.</P><P><STRONG><FONT color=green>ANTONYMS</FONT></STRONG>: blandness, dullness, exhaustion, hebetude, insipidity, lethargy, listlessness, weariness.</P>
