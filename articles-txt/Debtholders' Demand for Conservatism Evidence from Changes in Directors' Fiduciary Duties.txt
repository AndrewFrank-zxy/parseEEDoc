1. Introduction 
Research on accounting conservatism posits that demand from lenders is the main reason why ﬁrms adopt conservative accounting policies (Watts [2003]). Supporting evidence for this conjecture is primarily based on documented associations between conservatism and various characteristics of debt contracting (e.g., Ahmed et al. [2002], Ball and Shivakumar [2005], Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008], Zhang [2008]), but most of them are not of a causal nature, raising the question of whether conservatism is indeed demanded by debtholders. Moreover, conservatism could also be excessive and thus inefﬁcient for ﬁrms and even detrimental to debtholders, which appears to conﬂict with the presumption that debtholders would always demand conservatism. For instance, too much conservatism may result in tighter debt covenants leading to premature transfer of decision rights to debtholders, which might unduly constrain a ﬁrm’s investment and ﬁnancing policies (Leuz [2001]). Also, excessive conservatism may allow managers to create hidden reserves, which may be reversed in the future at the discretion of shareholders (Leuz [1998]). To help resolve this ambiguity on debtholder preferences, we exploit an important legal event to identify a causal link between debtholders’ demand and accounting conservatism. A 1991 Delaware court in the ruling of Credit Lyonnais Bank v. Pathe Communications (hereafter “the court ruling”) expanded the scope of directors’ ﬁduciary duties to include creditors when a Delaware incorporated ﬁrm is in the “vicinity of insolvency.” The fact that the court ruling had no judgment on ﬁnancial reporting per se, combined with the natural event setting, which helps mitigate the issue of confounding factors, makes it possible to attribute any post-ruling change in conservatism by near insolvent Delaware companies to debtholders’ demand for conservatism.1
