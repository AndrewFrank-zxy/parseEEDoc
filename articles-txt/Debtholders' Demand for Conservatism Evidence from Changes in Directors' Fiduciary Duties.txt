Introduction
Research on accounting conservatism posits that demand from lenders is the main reason why firms adopt conservative accounting policies (Watts [2003]). Supporting evidence for this conjecture is primarily based on documented associations between conservatism and various characteristics of debt contracting (e.g., Ahmed et al. [2002], Ball and Shivakumar [2005], Beatty, Weber,  and Yu  [2008], Zhang [2008]), but most of them are not  of a causal nature, raising the question of whether conservatism is indeed demanded by debtholders. Moreover, conservatism could also be excessive and thus inefficient for firms and even detrimental to debtholders, which appears to conflict with the presumption that debtholders would always demand conservatism. For instance, too much conservatism may result in tighter debt covenants leading to premature transfer of decision rights to debtholders, which might unduly constrain a firm’s investment and financing policies (Leuz [2001]). Also, excessive conservatism may allow managers to create hidden reserves, which may be reversed in the future at the discretion of shareholders (Leuz [1998]). To help resolve this ambiguity on debtholder preferences, we exploit an important legal event to identify a causal link between debtholders’ demand and accounting conservatism.
A 1991 Delaware court in the ruling of Credit Lyonnais Bank v. Pathe Communications (hereafter “the court ruling”) expanded the scope of directors’ fiduciary duties to include creditors when a Delaware incorporated firm is in the “vicinity of insolvency.” The fact that the court ruling had no judgment on financial reporting per se, combined with the natural event setting, which helps mitigate the issue of confounding factors, makes it possible to attribute any post-ruling change in conservatism by near insolvent Delaware companies to debtholders’ demand for conservatism.
We use a difference-in-differences research design to capture the differential post-ruling changes in financial reporting conservatism between firms near insolvency and away from insolvency and between firms incorporated in and outside the State of Delaware. We employ a firm-year specific composite score as our main measure of conservatism and supplement it with the asymmetric timeliness models of Basu [1997] and Ball and Shivakumar [2006]. Overall, we find that, in the immediate period following the court ruling in 1991, financial reporting conservatism significantly increased for near insolvent Delaware firms. The results indicate that, in response to their increased fiduciary obligations to creditors, directors of firms subject to the court ruling influence managers to adopt more conservative financial reporting.
We further examine the role of board characteristics on the effect of the court ruling since this legal event increased the fiduciary duties of individual directors, thereby establishing a firm’s board as the primary channel through which any response to the ruling should occur.  Our finding of  a more pronounced increase in conservatism for near insolvent Delaware firms with stronger boards provides additional support to our argument that the observed changes in conservatism are driven by the court ruling.
We conduct a number of additional analyses to test the robustness of our findings. Our results hold after controlling for confounding factors like real actions that firms can take as they become distressed, large negative write-offs, covenant violations and bankruptcies, and other stakeholders’ demand for conservatism. To account for the effect of fluctuating firm performance, we rerun our main test on a performance-matched sample, a subsample that holds a firm’s near insolvency status constant, and a shortened sample period during which firms are less likely to change their near insolvency status. We also address possible selection biases on account of state of incorporation choice and the level of default risk. Our main results remain significant and consistent across all supplemental tests.
Our study makes a number of contributions. First, it establishes a clear causal link between debtholders’ demand and accounting conservatism. Prior studies have struggled to provide causal evidence on debtholders’ demand for conservatism due to potential confounding factors that may also contribute to a firm’s decision to adopt more accounting conservatism.2 We use an exogenous shock of a legal event, which expanded fiduciary duties of directors to include creditors, as a mechanism to examine whether debtholders indeed demand conservatism. This natural setting significantly mitigates endogeneity concerns and makes it easier to attribute changes in conservatism around the event to debtholders’ demand. Second, our findings of a more pronounced increase in conservatism for firms with stronger boards suggest that the effect of the court ruling on accounting conservatism comes through the channel of the board of directors. These results also add to our understanding of the role of directors in corporate financial reporting. Last, consistent with Bushman and Piotroski [2006], our study provides additional support to the premise that judicial decisions and the associated litigation risk can have a significant impact on a company’s financial reporting decisions.
This paper is subject to two limitations. First, any variable that purports to capture “vicinity of insolvency” will be noisy due to lack of a precise legal definition of the concept. We attempt to mitigate this possible measurement error by using multiple proxies for near insolvency status. Second, our sample may include firms that either have violated certain debt covenants or are severely distressed. In such situations, debtholders may have already been actively engaged in business decisions and pushing for more conservatism. To rule out the confounding effects of covenant violations, we control for debt covenant violations in a subsample of firms with available hand-collected data on covenant violations and find robust results. In addition, in our main analyses, we also constrain the sample to near insolvent firms and find a significantly larger increase in conservatism for such firms that are incorporated in Delaware, thus ruling out financial distress as an alternative explanation for the observed results.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We develop hypotheses in section 2 and present regression models in section 3. In sections 4 and 5, we discuss sample data and elaborate on the empirical results respectively. Section 6 presents sensitivity analyses and section 7 concludes.
Motivation and Hypotheses
Delaware is a popular state of incorporation, as evidenced by the fact that more than 50% of publicly traded companies in the United States have opted to register in that state under the Delaware General Incorporation Law (corp.delaware.gov). As a result of choosing to incorporate in Delaware, businesses are subject to the jurisdiction of Delaware courts and are bound by their rulings and legal interpretations.3 Under common law, directors have fiduciary responsibilities to exercise due care, to demonstrate loyalty, and to act in good faith. It is commonly accepted that the fiduciary duties of directors are owed primarily to shareholders in financially healthy firms, and a number of Delaware court rulings have supported this common law belief.
But the circumstances changed for near insolvent Delaware firms as a result of a court ruling in one landmark case, Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, N.V. v. Pathe Communications Corp. (C.A. No. 12150, 1991 WL 277613). The dispute involved the actions of the CEO and executive committee of directors appointed at the behest of a major creditor of MGM Corporation, Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, as part of a corporate governance agreement. MGM’s controlling stockholder, Pathe Communications, sued the board for breach of fiduciary duties to shareholders and favoring creditors’ interests when the executive committee rejected Pathe’s request to sell certain assets. The court ruled that the board had acted in the interests of the company and observed, “Where a corporation is operating in the vicinity of insolvency, a board of directors is not merely the agent of the residual risk-bearers, but owes its duty to the corporate enterprise.” The judge further elaborated by way of an example in a separate annotation (footnote
55) that:
The footnote gained a fair amount of attention in the business press and among corporate law scholars.5 The consensus was that, as a result of the court ruling, the scope of fiduciary duties of directors of Delaware firms was expanded to include creditors when a firm approached insolvency (Varallo and Finkelstein [1992], Barondes [1998], Dionne [2007]).6 While the phrase “vicinity of insolvency” does not refer to an insolvency or bankruptcy status, there is no legal definition of the term.7 Nevertheless, the newly introduced firm status brought an additional dimension to directors’ fiduciary obligations and increased their legal exposure. Therefore, directors in near insolvent firms would be more likely to consider debtholder interests after the court ruling became effective.
Conservative accounting constrains upward valuations of net assets and cumulative earnings, and consequently it helps mitigate wealth appropriations by lower order claimants (Watts [2003]). Basu [1997] and Ball and Shivakumar [2005] further suggest that external parties, such as debtholders, are likely to demand more timely disclosure of bad news to offset managers’ incentive to disclose good news early. Prior research has relied on this accounting principle to conjecture that conservatism is mainly driven by debtholders’ demand. While this conjecture is plausible, the extant empirical findings are in general not of a causal nature and thus make it difficult to rule out the possibility that conservatism is driven by factors other than debtholders’ demand. In addition, potential negative effects of excessive conservatism cast further doubt on whether conservatism indeed benefits debtholders.8 Therefore, it is empirically challenging to identify a setting where a causal link can be established between debtholder preferences and conservatism.
A Delaware court in 1991 introduced a new “vicinity of insolvency” status wherein the fiduciary obligations of directors were expanded to include creditors. This natural event allows us to identify a clear causal link between debtholder preferences and conservatism. The court ruling gave creditors the ability to sue directors of near insolvent companies for breach of fiduciary obligations if actions taken by board members were viewed as either too risky or too shareholder friendly. Creditors, especially those lending to near insolvent Delaware firms, should favor conservative accounting as it induces timely recognition of losses while imposing a higher level of verifiability requirement for gains (Ryan [2006]).9 Consequently, given the expanded fiduciary duties to creditors after the court ruling, directors of near insolvent Delaware firms could influence management to adopt more accounting conservatism to meet the preference of debtholders and thus mitigate the increased litigation risk on account of directors’ new fiduciary duties to creditors.
Under Delaware laws, directors are usually protected by the business judgment rule for actions taken in the best interests of the corporation, and companies are required to indemnify directors for expenses arising out of third party legal proceedings brought against the directors as long as they act in good faith; also, Directors’ and Officers’ (D&O) liability insurance provides additional protection. However, as firms approach insolvency, directors’ litigation concerns increase because struggling companies may not be able to provide indemnification, thus exposing directors to personal liability in the event of lawsuits. Moreover, if directors fail in their fiduciary duties, companies cannot indemnify directors and D&O insurance may not pay for damages either (Dickey et. al [2003]).10
A recent study by Becker and Stromberg [2012] offers a possible contradicting view. The authors find that the court ruling led to a reduction in risk-taking in near insolvent Delaware firms as well as their greater willingness to invest in projects that likely benefit both shareholders and debtholders. In other words, the Becker and Stromberg [2012] study suggests   that the increased fiduciary duties of directors in near insolvent Delaware firms significantly mitigated shareholder–debtholder conflicts. Following this line of reasoning, with new claims arising from fiduciary duties of directors, creditors may no longer need to rely on financial reporting conservatism to protect their interests and this could result in a lower demand for accounting conservatism from lenders. Consequently, it is possible that near insolvent Delaware firms may exhibit no change (or even a reduction) in financial reporting conservatism following the court ruling.
However, based on the discussions, the reasons to expect higher conservatism after the Delaware court ruling are more persuasive and hence we propose the following hypothesis (stated in alternative form):
H1: Near insolvent Delaware firms increase accounting conservatism after the 1991 Delaware court ruling.
The court ruling directly impacts the fiduciary obligations of directors and therefore the board of directors serves as a channel through which the court ruling should take effect. Prior literature documents that board characteristics like the presence of outsiders or specialists strengthen board governance, because those directors have higher reputational concerns, are less likely to be controlled by shareholders, and are more effective in monitoring financial reporting decisions (Ahmed and Duellman [2007], Krishnan and Visvanathan [2008], Cohen et al. [2014]).11 Therefore, if the observed changes in conservatism in near insolvent Delaware firms are due to the effects of the court ruling, we expect firms with stronger boards to be more likely to respond to the expanded fiduciary obligations implied by the court ruling and pay more attention to debtholder interests, which would result in a more pronounced change in conservatism among near insolvent Delaware firms with stronger boards.
Research Design
This section presents the discussion on variable measurement, empirical model specifications, and estimation methods. Detailed definitions of all key variables are given in the appendix.
We follow a difference-in-differences approach across three dimensions, namely, state of incorporation, near insolvency status, and court ruling period to explore the differential post-ruling changes in conservatism across treatment and control groups. Specifically, we first examine (i) the pre– post difference in conservatism for near insolvency firms in Delaware versus in other states and (ii) the pre–post difference in conservatism for Delaware near insolvent versus Delaware non-near insolvent firms; and we then (iii) combine the two approaches (both of which are imperfect due to nonrandomness of treatment/control group assignment) and perform a double difference-in-differences test, whereby we allow for cross-sectional variations in both a firm’s Delaware incorporation status and its near insolvency status. This empirical design is equivalent to teasing out the effect of the court ruling in two steps: isolating the effect of the ruling on conservatism attributable to state of incorporation and to near insolvency status, and comparing this effect in pre– and post–court-ruling periods.
Our primary dependent variable is an estimate of firm-year level conservatism score similar to that of Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008] and Zhang [2008]. We focus on a composite measure since accounting conservatism is multifaceted (Ryan [2006]) and litigation risk induces both conditional and unconditional conservatism (Beaver and Ryan [2005], Qiang [2007]). A composite measure also helps avoid generalizability and estimation problems associated with any single measure of conservatism.
To test our hypothesis, we estimate the following regression model using the firm-year–specific conservatism score:
CRANK ALL = β0 + β1DEL + β2HEDF93 + β3DEL × HEDF93 where CRANK ALL is a composite conservatism measure equal to the average decile ranks of three conservatism proxies identified in prior studies:
C ACCR, that is, negative non-operating accruals, calculated as ( 1) the average of non-operating accruals scaled by total assets over a five-year window (with a minimum of two years) centered in the observation year t,
C SKEW, which is relative skewness of earnings versus cash flows, calculated as ( 1) skewness of earnings scaled by skewness of cash flows over a 20-quarter window (with a minimum of five quarters) centered in the observation year t, 12,13 and (iii) C PZ for the unrecorded reserves on the balance sheet at the end of the observation year based on Penman and Zhang [2002].14 CRANK ALL incorporates different aspects of conservatism: conditional conservatism proxied by negative non-operating accruals and relative skewness measure, as well as adoption of unconditional accounting
13 In additional analyses, we measure C ACCR and C SKEW over either a five-year window centered in year t 1 or a three-year window centered in year t, and still find a positive  effect of the court ruling on conservatism when conservatism is measured as negative nonoperating accruals, relative earnings skewness, and the composite conservatism measure (see online appendix table A1).
14 Specifically, C PZ is calculated as the sum of (i) LIFO reserve as reported in the observa- conservatism through unrecorded reserves, which result in lower reported net income (PZ score).15
The court ruling applies only to Delaware-incorporated firms near insolvency. Since there is no legal definition of the term “near insolvency,” we follow Becker and Stromberg [2012] in using Estimated Default Frequency (EDF) based on the probability transformation of “distance-to-default” developed by Merton [1974] to develop our measure of near insolvency.16 We construct the near insolvency indicator HEDF93 based on the 1993 EDF score, because 1993 is the first post-transition full year in our analysis when the ruling became effective.17 HEDF93 is a dichotomous variable equal to one if a firm’s 1993 EDF score is in the top quartile of its distribution, and zero otherwise. Consistent with Becker and Stromberg [2012], HEDF93 only varies cross-sectionally in our models, as we need to fix the status of near insolvency at the 1993 level in order to conduct the differencein-differences analyses.18
Other variables in the model are defined as follows. DEL is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the firm is incorporated in the State of Delaware, and zero otherwise. POST is a dichotomous variable equal to one for the post-ruling period defined as 1993–1996 and zero for the pre-ruling period of 1988–1991.19 We include natural log of market value of equity (LNMVE) in our regression model to control for the effect of firm size on financial reporting conservatism as the literature provides arguments for either a positive or negative association of firm size with conservatism.20 The control for firms’ leverage (ratio of total liabilities to total assets, LEV) captures creditors’ overall demand for conservatism (Ahmed et al. [2002]). In addition, we include book-to-market ratio (BTM) and asset growth (GROWTH) to
16 We thank Tyler Shumway for sharing the SAS program to calculate EDF scores (wwwpersonal.umich.edu/~shumway/papers.dir/nuiter99 print.sas). cash flows data become widely available in Compustat, and this variable is required to estimate two-dimensional conservatism measures, that is, negative non-operating accruals (C ACCR) and relative earnings skewness (C SKEW). We exclude year 1992 from our analysis because the ruling was passed at the end of 1991, and it is unlikely to be fully implemented during the transition year of 1992. control for the effects of firms’ growth prospects on their financial reporting conservatism. High growth firms could prefer less conservative accounting because of greater pressures to present better accounting and stock performance (Ahmed and Duellman [2013]). To capture the effect of a greater demand for conservatism from firms in more litigious industries, we include a dichotomous variable for high-litigation industries, LITIG (Watts [2003], Khan and Watts [2009]). Finally, we also control for institutional ownership INSTOWN since prior research shows that institutional investors demand a higher level of accounting conservatism to ensure more efficient investment allocation (Ahmed and Duellman [2007], Ramalingagowda and Yu [2012]). Consistent with prior literature, we measure all control variables at the beginning of the year with all continuous variables winsorized at 1% and 99%. We cluster standard errors in all models by firm and year.21 The primary focus of our analysis is β7, which is predicted to be positive, that is, we expect near insolvent Delaware firms to experience an increase in conservatism in the post-ruling period.
To corroborate our findings in section 3.1, we explore board characteristics identified in prior literature to examine the role of board characteristics in the adoption of accounting conservatism. We create a composite measure of board governance, BSCORE, that is equal to the sum of the four dichotomous variables, namely: board size (D SMBRD), board independence (D MAJIND), board accounting expertise (D ACCEXP), and board industry expertise (D INDEXP). D SMBRD is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the total count of directors on the board is smaller than the sample median of eight members and zero otherwise. Similar to Ajinkya, Bhojraj, and Sengupta [2005], we measure board independence (D MAJIND) as a dichotomous variable equal to one if more than 50% of directors on the board are independent, and zero otherwise. D ACCEXP is measured as a dichotomous variable equal to one if at least one independent director on the board has accounting expertise, and zero otherwise.22 We define D INDEXP as a dichotomous variable equal to one if at least one independent director on the board has industry expertise, defined as any prior experience in another firm that operates in the same two-digit primary SIC industry, and zero otherwise (Faleye, Hoitash, and Hoitash [2012]). To examine how the board of directors could serve as a channel for the court ruling, we estimate
22 Following Defond, Hann, and Hu [2005], we define accounting financial experts as direc- the following equation:
CRANK ALL = β0 + β1DEL + β2HEDF93 + β3DEL × HEDF93 where X/P is a firm’s earnings per share deflated by the beginning of the year price, RET is a firm’s buy-and-hold annual stock return, and D is a dichotomous variable equal to one if RET is negative and zero otherwise. In addition to the six control variables used in model (1), that is, size
(LNMVE), leverage (LEV), book-to-market (BTM), growth (GROWTH), litigation risk (LITIG), and institutional ownership (INSTOWN), we also control for stock return volatility (STDRET) and natural log of stock price (LNPRC) because these variables have been shown to mitigate biases in the Basu [1997] model (Ball, Kothari, and Nikolaev [2013]). We measure all control variables at the beginning of the year. To control for possible confounding effects of these control variables on the cross-sectional variation in asymmetric timeliness, we include a full set of interaction terms of these control variables with D, RET, and our primary variable of interest D RET.24 Our hypothesis predicts that β31 is positive and significant, that is, near insolvent Delaware firms experience a large increase in asymmetric timeliness of earnings in the post-ruling period. where ACCR is a firm’s accruals (defined as the difference between income from continuing operations and operating cash flows) scaled by beginning of the year total assets, CF is a firm’s operating cash flows scaled by beginning of the year total assets, and DCF is a dichotomous variable equal to one if CF is negative and zero otherwise. We include the same set of control variables as in model (1). Similar to model (3), to control for possible confounding effects of control variables on asymmetric timeliness of accruals, we include a full set of interaction terms of control variables with DCF, CF, and DCF×CF.

Sample Selection and Descriptive Statistics
Panel A of table 1 describes construction of the sample used to test our main hypothesis. We begin with 86,672 firm-year observations from Compustat for 1988–1991 and 1993–1996. We first drop 11,092 firm-years with missing state of incorporation data in Compustat and another 17,148 observations of financial firms. We lose an additional 8,131 observations because of missing data needed to estimate the three conservatism measures, that is, C ACCR, C SKEW, and C PZ. We also drop 22,389 observations with missing data to compute 1993 EDF scores to measure near insolvency, and another 5,256 observations with negative market value equity or missing financial statement and institutional ownership data. Finally, after requiring each firm in our sample to have at least one observation in each of the preand post-ruling periods, our final sample has 18,827 firm-year observations (2,705 unique firms). Panel B of table 1 shows annual distribution of sample firms partitioned by DEL and HEDF93.
We present the descriptive statistics of our sample in table 2. Conservatism rank in our main sample has a mean of 4.500 and a median of 4.333
Summary Statistics on a 0–9 scale. Mean (median) C ACCR (i.e., negative non-operating accruals) is 0.017 (0.009) and mean (median) C SKEW (i.e., the ratio of earnings skewness to cash flows skewness) is 0.820 (0.191), generally consistent with prior literature (e.g., Givoly and Hayn [2000], Ahmed and Duellman [2007], Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008], and Zhang [2008]). Similar to Penman and Zhang [2002], our sample has a mean (median) C PZ of 0.356 (0.100). About half of our sample is in the post-ruling period (mean of POST, 0.516). Consistent with prior findings (e.g., Daines [2001]), approximately 51% of firm-years in our sample correspond to firms incorporated in Delaware (mean of DEL, 0.507). Mean (median) EDF93 of 5.4% (0.002%) implies that the 1993 EDF distribution is right skewed, that is, our sample includes some firms that were highly distressed in 1993.25 The mean value of HEDF93 (0.186) indicates that about 19% of sample firm-year observations have a 1993 EDF score in the top quartile of its distribution. Mean (median) MVE of our sample is $852.401 (94.500) million, suggesting that our sample is somewhat skewed toward larger firms. Descriptive statistics on other control variables are in general consistent with expectations.26

The negative correlation between our conservatism measure and leverage appears to contradict prior studies (e.g., Khan and Watts [2009]), but multivariate analyses confirm the documented positive association of leverage with conservatism. The negative association of book-to-market ratio with conservatism is consistent with the expected positive association between conservatism and market-to-book (e.g., Roychowdhury and Watts [2007]). HEDF93 is positively correlated with CRANK ALL, that is, firms approaching near insolvency in 1993 are on average more conservative during the sample period. Predictably, firm size (natural log of market value of equity) and default risk in 1993 are also negatively correlated, as near insolvent firms are more likely to be undercapitalized. Other significant correlations are generally in line with expectations.
Empirical Results
Panel A of table 4 presents three types of difference-in-differences tests. First, we constrain the sample to Delaware firms (i.e., DEL 1) and compare the increase in conservatism for firms near insolvency and those that are not. We find that, after the court ruling, near insolvent Delaware firms increase conservatism significantly more than not near insolvent Delaware firms (column (i): coefficient on POST HEDF93 0.393, t-stat 4.48).  Second, we focus on a subsample of near insolvent firms (i.e., HEDF93 1) and find that the change in conservatism around the court ruling is significantly larger for near insolvent firms incorporated in Delaware than those incorporated elsewhere (column (ii): coefficient on POST DEL 0.497,  t-stat 4.26).
Last, we estimate the full model (1) on the entire sample and present the result in column (iii) in panel A. As predicted by our hypothesis, we find that the coefficient on POST DEL HEDF93 is positive and significant (β7  0.489, t-stat  3.82), which suggests that near insolvent Delaware  firms exhibit a larger increase in conservatism around the court ruling. Focusing on the full specification in column (iii), we find that CRANK ALL is positively associated with litigation risk and institutional ownership, and negatively with firm size, book-to-market ratio, and asset growth, consistent with prior literature (e.g., Roychowdhury and Watts [2007], Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008], Ramalingegowda and Yu [2012]).
We also estimate model (1) using dimensional conservatism  ranks (i.e., negative non-operating accruals, relative earnings skewness, and unrecorded reserves on the balance sheet) as the dependent variable. Dimensional results in panel B of table 4 also provide similar evidence to those in column (iii) of panel A, suggesting that our result on the composite conservatism measure is not driven by a particular measure of conservatism. Overall, the results in table 4 are consistent with the notion that near insolvent Delaware firms increased conservatism as a response to the 1991 court ruling.27

In additional analyses presented in online appendix table A6, we examine whether our main finding in column (iii) of table 4, panel A is robust to alternative definitions of near insolvency. This test is important because it is possible that, since the EDF measure we employ to identify near insolvent firms is based on accounting and stock performance, it could already capture effects of conservatism, potentially biasing our results. To corroborate our findings, we construct three alternative measures of near insolvency:
(i) HMLEV93, an indicator variable equal to 1 if the firm is in the top quartile of 1993 market leverage distribution and 0 otherwise, where market leverage is measured as the ratio of shortand long-term debt to shortand long-term debt plus market value of equity; (ii) HBLEV93, an indicator variable equal to 1 if the firm is in the top quartile of 1993 book leverage distribution and 0 otherwise, where book leverage is measured as the ratio of shortand long-term debt to total assets; and (iii) LALT93, an indicator variable that equals 1 if the firm falls in the bottom quartile of distribution of Altman’s Z-score in 1993 and 0 otherwise. Results using alternative near insolvency measures remain generally consistent with those reported in table 4 except the one using LALT93, which is significant at a one-tailed test (β7 = 0.153, t-stat = 1.44).
We use a single board governance measure BSCORE, which combines four dimensional board characteristics to explore the effect of board characteristics on conservatism in the post-ruling period because biographical information on directors is available to us only for years 1993–1996 (results reported in table 5). We start our analysis in this subsample with the baseline regression without board measures, and the result in column (i) suggests that, in the post-ruling period, the difference in conservatism between near insolvent and not near insolvent firms is larger for firms incorporated in Delaware than those incorporated elsewhere. Column (ii) in table 5 presents the main result of model (2), and column (iii) further includes the interaction terms of firm characteristics with the ruling-related variables, i.e., DEL, HEDF93, and DEL HEDF93. The positive and significant coefficient on BSCORE  DEL  HEDF93 in column (iii) (β7  0.397,  t-stat 2.39) combined with the insignificant coefficient on DEL HEDF93 indicates that the higher post-ruling conservatism level in near insolvent Delaware firms is driven by firms with stronger boards. In a supplemental analysis tabulated in online appendix table A7, we provide evidence on dimensional measures of board strength and find that β7 is similarly positive and significant at conventional levels for all board measures except industry expertise, the result of which is marginally significant in a one-tailed

Asymmetric Timeliness of Earnings. Results of model (3) are shown in table 6. In column (i), we first constrain our sample to Delaware firms and vary their near insolvency status. Consistent with prior literature, β3, the coefficient on timeliness of bad news recognition (D RET) is positive and significant (0.223, t-stat 3.59). Moreover, consistent with our hypothesis, the post-ruling increase in asymmetric timeliness of earnings for near insolvent Delaware firms is significantly larger than that of non-near insolvent Delaware firms (coefficient on HEDF93 POST  D  RET  0.143, t-stat 2.49). In column (ii), we constrain our sample to near insolvent firms only and allow Delaware incorporation status to vary.

Delaware firms than for near insolvent non-Delaware firms (coefficient on DEL POST D RET 0.214, t-stat 2.92). Finally, we allow both Delaware incorporation and near insolvency status of a firm to vary in the full sample and present a complete version of model (3) in column (iii). β31, the coefficient on our main variable of interest (HEDF93 DEL POST D RET), is positive and significant (0.172, t-stat 2.22), suggesting that the post-ruling increase in asymmetric timeliness of earnings is stronger for near insolvent Delaware firms. Our results similarly hold when we omit control variables and their interaction terms from model (3). These results are shown in online appendix table A8.
Asymmetric Timeliness of Accruals. We present results of model (4) in table 7. In column (i), we first constrain our sample to Delaware firms and vary their near insolvency status. Consistent with our expectation, near insolvent Delaware firms exhibit a higher increase in asymmetric timeliness of accruals after the ruling than non-near insolvent Delaware firms (coefficient on HEDF93 POST DCF CF 0.448, t-stat  3.47). Similarly, in column (ii), near insolvent Delaware firms increase asymmetric timeliness of accruals significantly more than near insolvent non-Delaware firms (coefficient on DEL POST DCF  CF  0.343, t-stat  2.17). Finally,  when allowing both Delaware incorporation and near insolvency status to vary (see column (iii)), we find that near insolvent Delaware firms exhibit significantly more asymmetric timeliness of accruals (coefficient on HEDF93 DEL POST DCF CF  0.444, t-stat  2.31). Our results continue to hold when we omit control variables and their interaction terms from model (4) (see online appendix table A9).
Overall, results on asymmetric timeliness of earnings (table 6) and asymmetric timeliness of accruals (table 7) supplement our main results on yearspecific conservatism ranks in table 4, and provide further support to our main hypothesis that near insolvent Delaware firms respond to the 1991 court ruling by increasing financial reporting conservatism.
Additional Analyses
We conduct a number of supplemental analyses to test the robustness of the empirical models and rule out alternative explanations for our results.
The natural experiment setting helps us attribute the change in conservatism around the court ruling to debtholders’ demand. However, it is still possible that other corporate decisions that accompanied the ruling may drive the change in conservatism. For example, near insolvent firms may undertake a number of operational changes, such as writing off assets and reducing capital expenditure, to improve profitability and/or increase liquidity, which could manifest themselves in the form of more conservative accounting policies. Because creditors could demand these actions as a

We therefore identify a number of control variables for operating and real changes to isolate the effect of the court ruling on conservatism.
Real Actions. Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein [1994] show that, as firms approach distress, they engage in asset sales, or improve their operating efficiency through optimizing the inventory and discretionary expenditure policies. The authors also suggest that better performing distressed firms are more likely to avoid insolvency. To mitigate the concern that our observed change in conservatism could be driven by real actions taken by firms, we augment our model (1) with additional controls for the following real actions: (i) DEC CAPEX, a dichotomous variable equal to one if a firm’s capital expenditure decreases when compared to the prior year and zero otherwise; (ii) INC SPPE, a dichotomous variable equal to one if a firm’s sale  of  PP&E  increases  from the prior year and zero otherwise; (iii) DEC NSEG, a  dichotomous variable equal to one if a firm decreases the number of  its  business or geographic segments during the year and zero otherwise;
(iv) NABN DISEXP, ( 1) abnormal discretionary expenses (Roychowdhury [2006]), and (v) NABN PROD, ( 1) abnormal production costs (Roychowdhury [2006]). As reported in table 8, we continue to find the coefficient on POST DEL HEDF93 to be positive and significant when either controlling for the five real actions variables themselves (column (i):  β7  0.472,  t-stat    3.67),  or  controlling  for  both  these  variables and their interactions with all the seven ruling-related variables (column (ii): β7  0.326, t-stat    1.70). In sum, the robust results after controlling for real actions corroborate the main findings in table 4 and lend stronger support to our hypothesis.
Special Items. Negative special items could be one mechanism through which firms adopt more accounting conservatism (Callen, Segal, and Hope [2010]). To the extent that negative special items, for example, one-time write-offs, could be more prevalent among near insolvent firms, the presence of negative special items could confound our results. We control for the presence of negative special items by including sales-deflated negative special items SI, which is equal to (  1)  SPI/SALES if SPI < 0 and 0 otherwise, and its interactions with all the seven ruling-related variables in addition to other control variables in model (1). The results (online appendix table A10) show that controlling for the effect of negative special items on conservatism as well as their possible variations along

This table presents regression estimates to test the effect of the 1991 Delaware court ruling on conservatism rank after controlling for effects of real actions. The sample includes 18,402 observations for 2,676 firms spanning calendar years 1988–1991 and 1993–1996. DEC CAPEX is a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if the capital expenditure (CAPX) decreases from the prior year and 0 otherwise. INC SPPE is a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if the sale of PPE (SPEE) increases from the prior year and 0 otherwise. DEC NSEG is a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if either the number of business segments or number of geographic segments decreases from prior year and 0 otherwise. NABN DISEXP is ( 1) abnormal discretionary expenditures (the sum of XRD, XAD, XSGA) per Roychowdhury [2006]. NABN PROD is ( 1) abnormal production costs (COGS   change in INVT) per Roychowdhury [2006]. All other variables are defined   in the the appendix. All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. Reported tstatistics are adjusted for clustering by both firm and year. the court ruling does not change the tenor of our main inferences (coefficient on POST×DEL×HEDF93 = 0.447, t-stat = 3.26).
Alternatively, our findings could be driven by the demand for conservatism from stakeholders other than creditors, who may also influence the extent of conservatism in financial reporting. Moreover, a shift of control rights to creditors or recorded losses in prior years may also explain debtholders’ increased demand for conservatism. To rule out these alternative explanations, we conduct additional tests as explained later.
Recorded Losses. Recorded losses are mechanically correlated with increases in conservatism and thus could confound our results. We rule out this concern by excluding firms most likely to have recorded large losses, which include (i) firms that experience most negative earnings changes (i.e., in the lowest decile of the distribution of earnings change), (ii) firms with negative operating cash flows yet positive net income, (iii) firms whose total liabilities exceed total assets, and (iv) firms whose current liabilities exceed current assets. After dropping 5,737 observations that meet at least one of these criteria, we continue to find a post-ruling increase in conservatism among near insolvent Delaware firms in this non-losses subsample (ß7 0.329, t-stat 2.01). These results are summarized in online appendix table A11.
(ß7	0.915, t-stat	0.83), that is, the court ruling does not seem to exert an effect on covenant violations similar to its effect on conservatism. In our analyses of this hand-collected subsample, summarized in panel B of online appendix table A12, the main results still hold either including a control variable for covenant violations (column (i): ß7	0.778, t-stat 2.19) or dropping the covenant violation observations (column (ii): ß7 0.691, t-stat	1.82).
In addition, while near insolvency does not necessarily lead to bankruptcy, voluntary filings for bankruptcy (chapters 7 or 11) or courtinitiated bankruptcy proceedings could require firms to follow liquidation basis of accounting, which may be correlated with our conservatism measure. Following Shumway [1997], we identify six firms (26 firm-year observations) that were delisted due to bankruptcy (CRSP delisting code 574) at any time during the period 1988–1996. We still obtain results in line with our hypothesis when we exclude these 26 bankruptcy observations from our sample (ß7 0.483, t-stat 3.77). These results are summarized in column
(iii) of panel B in online appendix table A12.
Other Stakeholders. Our results could be driven by the influence of auditors, as opposed to debtholders, on accounting conservatism. Prior studies show that firms audited by Big-N auditors have higher reporting conservatism and better earnings quality (Francis and Krishnan [1999], Francis, Maydew, and Sparks [1999]). To rule out this confounding factor, we regress conservatism ranks on a dichotomous variable BIGN (equal to one if the firm is audited by a Big-N auditor and zero otherwise) and its interactions with the seven ruling-related variables in addition to the other controls. The coefficient on POST DEL HEDF93 remains positive and significant (ß7   0.322, t-stat   1.69) after controlling  for the Big-N auditors effect, while the sign on BIGN POST DEL HEDF93 is not significant (see online appendix table A13, panel A).
Furthermore, our results could be driven by CEO/CFOs’ influence on accounting quality since higher managerial ownership mitigates the severity of the agency problems and thus reduces the demand for conservatism (LaFond and Roychowdhury [2008]). To address this concern, we conduct a post-ruling analysis (since Execucomp data are unavailable for the pre-ruling period) similar to model (2) with BSCORE replaced by the CEO/CFO ownership percentage, EXEOWN. As presented in panel B of online appendix table A13, after controlling for the effect of CEO/CFO ownership, the main variable of interest DEL×HEDF93 remains significantly positive (ß3 = 1.282, t-stat = 2.86) in the full model. deducted.31 We follow Graham and Mills [2008] to fill in missing values. Our main results remain similar to those reported in table 4 (coefficient on POST DEL HEDF93 0.829, t-stat 4.64) after controlling for the tax-related incentives.
To rule out the concern that the differential change in conservatism between treatment and control groups may be driven by the confounding changes in firm performance, as opposed to the court ruling, we conduct the following tests.
Sample Matched on Accounting Performance. An alternative explanation for our results could be that near insolvent Delaware firms in the sample have experienced stronger performance deteriorations than near insolvent non-Delaware firms. To rule out this concern, we perform a matched sample analysis, whereby we match every Delaware firm with a non-Delaware firm with either the closest ROA or the closest change in ROA in the same year and the same two-digit SIC industry. We continue to find that near insolvent Delaware firms exhibit higher conservatism in the post-ruling period (e.g., in the sample matched by ROA, the coefficient on POST  DEL   HEDF93   0.347, t-stat   2.00). These results are reported in columns (i) and (ii) of panel A in the online appendix table A15.
Holding Firms’ Near Insolvency Status Constant. It is possible that, throughout our sample period, Delaware firms moved out of near insolvency status, thereby taking themselves out of the scope of the court ruling. To address this concern, we restrict our sample to those Delaware and nonDelaware firms that consistently appear to be near insolvent, i.e., with annual EDF scores consistently in the highest quartile (693 observations) or consistently above median (3,774 observations) throughout the sample period. As our results in columns (iii) and (iv) in panel A of online appendix table A15 indicate, the effect of the court ruling on conservatism for near insolvent Delaware firms remains positive and significant (column (iii): ß7   1.584, t-stat   1.88; column (iv): ß7   0.624, t-stat   2.75) when firms’ near insolvency status is held constant. Thus, our findings do not appear to be confounded by Delaware firms moving out of the near insolvency zone. we find that the estimated effect of the ruling on conservatism for near insolvent Delaware firms is consistently positive and significant for two-year (ß7   0.369, t-stat    1.45), four-year (ß7    0.428, t-stat    2.42), and six-year (ß7 0.513, t-stat 3.54) event windows.32 The robustness of results on shortened event windows further supports our main findings by not only validating our definition of HEDF93 but also ruling out the possible confounding events during a longer period.
A firm’s state of incorporation and near insolvency status may not be random; rather, they can be driven by factors that also affect financial reporting choices. We address such selection biases using Propensity Score Matching methodology.
Possible Selection Bias of Near Insolvent Firms. Deteriorating performance and/or financial constraints systematically drive firms to be near insolvent. We control for such variables by implementing propensity score matching on firms’ near insolvency status. In the first stage, we estimate a logit regression model following Jones and Hensher [2004], where the explanatory variables for the probability of HEDF93 1 include a new economy indicator, cash resources deflated by total assets, operating cash flow deflated by total assets, debt–equity ratio, cash flow interest coverage ratio (i.e., operating cash flow deflated by net interest expense), and industry and year dummies as tabulated in panel A of online appendix table A16. We then use the predicted propensity of being near insolvent obtained from this model to match non-near insolvent firms (HEDF93 0) with near insolvent firms (HEDF93 1). In this matched sample we again find that the post-ruling increase in conservatism is larger for near insolvent Delaware firms (ß7 0.385, t-stat 2.15)—see panel B of online appendix table A16.
(1) conservatism measures are estimated over multiple years (e.g., C ACCR and C SKEW) to mitigate the impact of any temporary large accruals, and thus the change in conservatism over a short period may be small; (2) the effect of the ruling may also need more than one year to take hold. based on firms’ propensity to incorporate in Delaware to rule out the concern that the observed post-ruling increase in conservatism in near insolvent Delaware firms is related to factors that have driven the firm’s decision to incorporate in Delaware. We first estimate the probability of being incorporated in Delaware using firm characteristics identified by Bebchuk and Cohen [2003], which include log of sales, Tobin’s Q, ROA, number of employees, firm age, indicator variables for the state of business, and twodigit SIC industry dummies (see panel A of online appendix table A17). In the sample matched on the propensity score of being incorporated in Delaware, our main result on the larger post-ruling increase in conservatism for near insolvent Delaware firms (ß7 0.394, t-stat 1.82) remains consistent with those reported in table 4 (see panel B of online appendix table A17).
Last, our finding may be confounded by events that were concurrent to the court ruling in 1991. For example, a number of state antitakeover laws came into effect in the late 1980s–early 1990s and the passage of some of these laws coincided with our sample period. Armstrong, Balakrishnan, and Cohen [2012] document that Delaware adopted a stronger version  of these laws in 1988, and further find that the adoption of state antitakeover laws led to increased financial statement informativeness. Their results suggest that the adoption of antitakeover provisions could confound our finding of increased accounting conservatism after the 1991 court ruling (Jayaraman and Shivakumar [2013]). To mitigate this concern, we extend the sample period to include the years 1998–2001, when adoptions of antitakeover laws should have been completed across all state jurisdictions and their possible effects on conservatism should be stable. We rerun our analysis on the extended period (i.e., 1988–1991 as pre-ruling period and 1993–2001 as post-ruling period) and still find a positive and significant sign on POST DEL HEDF93 (ß7 0.414, t-stat  3.93) as reported in online appendix table A18. Therefore, the adoption of the state antitakeover laws is ruled out as an alternative explanation for our main results.
Conclusion
A 1991 Delaware court ruling expanded the scope of director fiduciary duties to include creditors for near insolvent Delaware firms. We exploit this natural event setting to establish a causal relation between accounting conservatism and debtholders’ demand. We find that near insolvent Delaware firms increased their conservatism in the  period  following the court ruling and this effect is more pronounced in near insolvent Delaware companies with stronger boards. The results are robust to alternative measures of conservatism and near insolvency status, controlling for operational changes, covenant violations, declines in firm performance, selection biases of the near insolvency status and the state of incorporation, other stakeholders’ demand for conservatism, and confounding events like the adoption of state antitakeover laws. Our findings provide evidence to support the casual link between debtholders’ demand and accounting conservatism as suggested in the literature. The study also offers some insights into the role of boards in financial reporting and suggests that litigation risk arising from fiduciary obligations is one reason why boards may influence financial reporting decisions.
