Key phrases in paragraph4:
1 The idea is that the court  ruling  provides an exogenous change  in fiduciary duties, which in turn should affect firms’ supply of conservative accounting. This exogenous variation allows us to identify debtholders’ demand for conservatism. If the shift in supply leads to no change in conservatism,  this suggests that the demand for conservatism is either fully inelastic (which is implausible) or absent,  which is the null for our tests.

2 Gormley, Kim, and Martin  [2012] exploit  an exogenous regulatory change  in the Indian banking industry. They document that  foreign  bank entry is associated  with more  timely loss recognition, and  this change appears to be  driven  by a shift in firms’ incentives  to supply additional information to lenders.

10 Judicial courts have held directors personally liable for providing misleading information and  gross negligence (e.g.,  see Escott v. Barchris Constr. Corp. 283 F. Supp.  643, S.D.N.Y. 1968 and  Smith v. Van Gorkom 488 A.2d 858, 3 EXC 112, Del. 1985).  More  recently,  directors of Enron and Worldcom  paid out of their pockets as part of the settlement (see In re Enron Corp., Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 391 F. Supp.  2d 541, S.D. Tex. 2005 and  In re WorldCom,  Inc. Sec. Litig., 388 F. Supp. 2d 319, S.D. N.Y. 2005).

12 Conservatism  results  in  persistently  negative  accruals,  while the  rate  of accumulation of negative  non-operating accruals  indicates  the  degree of conservatism  (Givoly and  Hayn [2000]). Averaging over a number of periods  mitigates the impact  of any temporary large accruals on conservatism measurement, as accruals tend to reverse within two years (Richardson et al. [2005]). In addition, measuring over a five-year window centered in year t, that is [t – 2,

19 Our  pre-ruling period begins  in 1988 because  1988 is the  first year in which operating cash flows data become widely available in Compustat, and this variable is required to estimate two-dimensional conservatism  measures,  that  is, negative  non-operating accruals  (C ACCR) and relative earnings skewness (C SKEW). We exclude  year 1992 from our analysis because the ruling  was passed  at the  end  of 1991, and  it is unlikely  to be fully implemented during the transition year of 1992.

Key phrases in paragraph18:
To corroborate our findings in section 3.1, we explore  board  characteristics identified in prior literature to examine the role of board characteristics in the  adoption of accounting conservatism.  We create  a composite measure of board  governance, BSCORE, that is equal to the sum of the four dichotomous variables, namely: board  size (D SMBRD), board  independence (D MAJIND), board  accounting expertise (D ACCEXP), and board  industry expertise (D INDEXP). D SMBRD is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the total count  of directors on the board  is smaller than the sample median of eight members and zero otherwise.  Similar to Ajinkya, Bhojraj, and Sengupta  [2005], we measure board  independence (D MAJIND) as a dichotomous variable equal to one if more than  50% of directors on the board  are independent, and zero otherwise. D ACCEXP is measured as a dichotomous variable equal to one if at least one independent director on the board  has accounting expertise, and  zero otherwise.22  We define  D INDEXP as a dichotomous variable  equal  to one  if at least one  independent director on the  board  has industry  expertise, defined as any prior  experience in another firm that  operates in the  same two-digit primary SIC industry, and zero otherwise (Faleye, Hoitash,  and Hoitash  [2012]). To examine how the board of directors could serve as a channel for the court ruling, we estimate

23 One  caveat with using  asymmetric  timeliness  of earnings as a conservatism  measure in our  setting  is that  its construction uses market  returns, while market  prices possibly respond to the court  ruling  and may embed an expectation of what the firm will do in response to the ruling.  This is the primary reason  why we rely on several conservatism proxies in our study. and DCF×CF.

Panel  A of table 1 describes  construction of the sample  used to test our main  hypothesis.  We begin  with 86,672 firm-year observations from  Compustat  for 1988–1991 and  1993–1996. We first drop  11,092 firm-years with missing state of incorporation data  in Compustat and  another 17,148 observations of financial  firms. We lose an additional 8,131 observations because of missing data needed to estimate  the three  conservatism  measures, that is, C ACCR, C SKEW, and C PZ. We also drop  22,389 observations with missing data to compute 1993 EDF scores to measure near  insolvency, and another 5,256 observations with negative market  value equity or missing financial  statement and institutional ownership data. Finally, after requiring each  firm  in our  sample  to have at least one  observation in each  of the preand post-ruling periods,  our final sample has 18,827 firm-year observations (2,705 unique firms). Panel B of table 1 shows annual distribution of sample firms partitioned by DEL and HEDF93.

Lower 	Upper on  a 0–9 scale. Mean  (median) C ACCR (i.e.,  negative  non-operating accruals) is 0.017 (0.009)  and mean (median) C SKEW (i.e., the ratio of earnings skewness to cash flows skewness) is 0.820 (0.191), generally  consistent with prior  literature (e.g., Givoly and Hayn [2000],  Ahmed  and Duellman [2007],  Beatty, Weber, and  Yu [2008],  and  Zhang  [2008]). Similar to Penman  and  Zhang  [2002],  our  sample  has a mean  (median) C PZ of 0.356 (0.100).  About  half  of our  sample  is in the  post-ruling period (mean of POST, 0.516). Consistent with prior findings (e.g., Daines [2001]), approximately 51% of firm-years in our sample correspond to firms incorporated in Delaware (mean of DEL, 0.507). Mean (median) EDF93 of 5.4% (0.002%) implies that  the 1993 EDF distribution is right  skewed, that  is, our  sample includes  some firms that were highly distressed  in 1993.25  The mean  value of HEDF93 (0.186)  indicates  that  about  19% of sample  firm-year observations  have a 1993 EDF score  in the  top  quartile of its distribution. Mean (median) MVE of our sample is $852.401 (94.500) million,  suggesting  that our  sample  is somewhat  skewed toward  larger  firms. Descriptive  statistics on other control variables are in general consistent with expectations.26

This table provides  the Spearman correlation coefficients  for the main variables in the main tests. Italicized rows are p-values. Significant  correlations are indicated in bold  (p < 0.10, two-tailed test).  All variables are  calculated as defined in the  appendix. All continuous variables are  winsorized  at 1st and  99th percentiles. the  income  aggregation and  information asymmetries  hypothesis  by LaFond  and  Watts [2008]  and  consistent with prior  literature (Ramalingegowda  and  Yu  [2012],   LaFond  and  Roychowhury  [2008]); and  is positively correlated with litigation risk and institutional ownership (e.g., Beatty, Weber,  and  Yu  [2008]  and  Ramalingegowda and  Yu  [2012]). The  negative correlation between  our  conservatism measure and  leverage  appears to contradict prior  studies  (e.g., Khan  and  Watts [2009]), but  multivariate analyses confirm  the documented positive association  of leverage  with conservatism.  The  negative  association  of book-to-market ratio  with conservatism is consistent with the expected positive association  between  conservatism and market-to-book (e.g., Roychowdhury and Watts [2007]). HEDF93 is positively correlated with CRANK ALL, that  is, firms approaching near  insolvency in 1993 are on average more  conservative  during the sample period. Predictably,  firm size (natural log of market  value of equity) board  in our sample has about eight directors (similar to Anderson, Mansi, and Reeb [2004]). The  average  PCT INDDIR is 0.675, suggesting  that  on  average  about  68%  of the  directors on  the  board  are  independent, similar  to  data  reported in  Ahmed  and  Duellman [2007]. The mean  D MAJIND is 0.873, implying that  about  87% of firms in our sample  have majority independent boards.  In addition, consistent with the  perceived lack of accounting expertise on  boards  prior  to the  passage  of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act in 2002 and  with the  findings  in Krishnan  and Visvanathan [2008], we find that only 22.1% of our sample observations have at least one director with accounting expertise. Finally, we find at least one director with industry expertise on 28.2% of firm-years in our sample. firms exhibit  a larger  increase  in  conservatism  around the  court  ruling. Focusing on the full specification in column  (iii), we find that CRANK ALL is positively associated  with litigation  risk and  institutional ownership, and negatively with firm size, book-to-market ratio, and asset growth, consistent with prior  literature (e.g., Roychowdhury and Watts [2007],  Beatty, Weber, and Yu [2008], Ramalingegowda and Yu [2012]).

6.1.1.  Real Actions. Asquith, Gertner, and  Scharfstein [1994]  show that, as firms approach distress, they engage  in asset sales, or improve  their operating efficiency  through optimizing the  inventory  and  discretionary expenditure policies. The authors also suggest that better performing distressed   firms  are  more   likely  to  avoid  insolvency.  To  mitigate   the concern that  our  observed  change in  conservatism  could  be  driven  by real  actions  taken  by firms,  we augment our  model  (1)  with additional controls   for  the  following  real  actions:  (i)  DEC CAPEX, a  dichotomous variable  equal   to  one   if  a  firm’s  capital   expenditure  decreases   when compared  to  the  prior   year  and   zero  otherwise;   (ii)   INC SPPE, a  dichotomous  variable   equal   to  one   if  a  firm’s  sale  of  PP&E  increases from   the   prior   year  and   zero   otherwise;   (iii)   DEC NSEG,  a  dichotomous   variable   equal   to  one   if  a  firm   decreases   the   number  of  its business  or  geographic segments   during the  year  and  zero  otherwise;

32 The marginal significance  for the two-year event window is probably  due to two reasons: (1)  conservatism measures  are estimated over multiple  years (e.g.,  C ACCR and  C SKEW) to mitigate the impact of any temporary large accruals, and thus the change  in conservatism over a short period may be small; (2) the effect of the ruling  may also need  more  than  one year to take hold.
